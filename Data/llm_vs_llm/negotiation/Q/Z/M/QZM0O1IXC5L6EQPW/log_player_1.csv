Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an initial offer that's close to Bob's known maximum value but leaves some room for negotiation if needed.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $13,000 is higher than John's $12,000 but still significantly below the product's value to Bob ($15,000), I'll reject this offer and make a counter-offer in the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still maintain a price that gives me good value, considering Bob values the product at $15,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer of $13,500 is getting more reasonable, but I believe there's still room for a better deal. However, we're getting closer to a fair price point, and continuing negotiations risks Bob walking away. Since $13,500 is significantly better than John's $12,000 offer, I'll accept this offer.
