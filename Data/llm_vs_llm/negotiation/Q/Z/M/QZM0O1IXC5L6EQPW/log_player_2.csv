"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice and no more than $15,000 to me, there's room for negotiation. Alice's offer of $14,500 is quite close to John's price of $15,000, so there's potential to negotiate a better deal with Alice. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer, aiming for a lower price. If negotiations fail, I can still fall back on John's offer of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 13000}

Reasoning: I'll offer $13,000, which is:
1. Above Alice's cost ($12,000), giving her a $1,000 profit margin
2. Significantly below both her initial offer ($14,500) and John's price ($15,000)
3. A reasonable starting point that leaves room for negotiation if Alice counteroffers
4. Would save me $2,000 compared to John's price if accepted

This offer is strategic because it's high enough to be taken seriously but low enough to leave room for negotiation while still ensuring Alice can make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: Alice has moved down from $14,500 to $14,000, showing she's willing to negotiate. However, since the product is worth $12,000 to her, there's still room for a better deal. The $14,000 price still leaves a $2,000 profit margin for Alice. Since John's offer of $15,000 remains available as a fallback option, I can afford to continue negotiating with Alice. I'll make another counteroffer that's higher than my previous one of $13,000 but still below $14,000 to try to reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 13500}

Reasoning: I'll offer $13,500, which is:
1. A $500 increase from my previous offer of $13,000, showing willingness to compromise
2. Splits the difference between my last offer ($13,000) and Alice's current offer ($14,000)
3. Still gives Alice a healthy $1,500 profit margin above her cost ($12,000)
4. Would save me $1,500 compared to John's price if accepted

This counteroffer demonstrates good faith in the negotiation by moving significantly from my initial position while still maintaining a favorable price for me. It's a reasonable middle ground that could lead to a deal."
