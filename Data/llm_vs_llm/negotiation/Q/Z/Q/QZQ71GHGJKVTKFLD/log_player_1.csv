Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is quite a bit higher than what I'm willing to spend. My budget is around $6000. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
