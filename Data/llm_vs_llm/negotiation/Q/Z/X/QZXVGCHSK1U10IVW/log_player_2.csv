"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you my exclusive product for $150. This product is top quality and I believe it will serve you very well. If you’re interested, just let me know – I’d be happy for you to take advantage of this offer today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

The reason for this decision is that Alice's offer of $150 exceeds my budget of $120. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $120, which is within my budget, I will reject Alice's offer and consider purchasing from John instead."
