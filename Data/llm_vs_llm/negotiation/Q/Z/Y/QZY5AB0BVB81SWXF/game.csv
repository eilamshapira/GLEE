"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12000 is too high for my budget. I've done my market research, and I can find similar products for much less. I'd be willing to pay $6500 for the product. This is a fair price that would work for both of us.",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to lower my offer to $10000, which is still a great deal considering the quality and benefits of the product. Let me know if this works for you!",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. However, $10000 is still outside my budget. I've actually received an offer from another seller for $8000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer $7200, which would save you the trouble of finding another buyer and give me a small savings. What do you think?",7200.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to work with me. Given your budget and the other offer you mentioned, I can come down to $8500. This price is competitive and reflects the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you can consider!",8500.0,Alice,5,
