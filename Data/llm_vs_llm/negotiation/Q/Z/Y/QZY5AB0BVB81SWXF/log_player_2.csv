"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $12000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a fair price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative offer ($8,000). It would be irrational to accept this offer when I can either:
1. Make a counteroffer to try to get a better price from Alice
2. Buy from John at $8,000 if negotiations with Alice don't work out

Let me reject this offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12,000 is too high for my budget. I've done my market research, and I can find similar products for much less. I'd be willing to pay $6,500 for the product. This is a fair price that would work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 6500}

I'm making a counteroffer of $6,500 because:
1. It's below my maximum value of $8,000, giving me potential savings
2. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, giving room for negotiation
3. It's below John's price of $8,000, which gives me leverage in the negotiation
4. If Alice rejects this, I can still increase my offer while staying below both my maximum value and John's price"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to lower my offer to $10000, which is still a great deal considering the quality and benefits of the product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer because:
1. $10,000 is still above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative offer ($8,000)
2. Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing her price from $12,000 to $10,000
3. There's still room for negotiation to reach a more reasonable price
4. I always have the option to buy from John at $8,000 if negotiations with Alice don't improve

I'll make another counteroffer to try to reach a price that's better than John's $8,000 price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. However, $10,000 is still outside my budget. I've actually received an offer from another seller for $8,000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer $7,200, which would save you the trouble of finding another buyer and give me a small savings. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7200}

I'm offering $7,200 because:
1. It's below my maximum value of $8,000
2. It's below John's alternative price of $8,000
3. I've mentioned the competing offer of $8,000 to show Alice I have alternatives
4. The price is a significant increase from my previous offer of $6,500, showing I'm willing to be reasonable
5. It leaves room for one more round of negotiation if needed, while still staying under $8,000"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to work with me. Given your budget and the other offer you mentioned, I can come down to $8500. This price is competitive and reflects the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you can consider! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John because:
1. Alice's offer of $8,500 is still above my maximum value of $8,000
2. Alice's offer is $500 more than John's price of $8,000
3. Even though Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, she's still not beating or matching John's price
4. After multiple rounds of negotiation, Alice seems unwilling to go below $8,500
5. Continuing to negotiate further might not lead to a better outcome, as Alice knows about the competing offer but still prices above it

It's more rational to accept John's guaranteed offer of $8,000 rather than continue negotiations or pay more than my maximum value."
