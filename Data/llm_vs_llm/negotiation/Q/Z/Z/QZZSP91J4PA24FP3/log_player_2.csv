"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer because $2,000,000 is significantly above my maximum value of $1,500,000. It wouldn't make sense to accept a price that's higher than my maximum value, especially when John is offering exactly $1,500,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer of $2,000,000 and John's fixed price of $1,500,000. This gives room for negotiation while potentially allowing me to save money compared to John's price. If Alice accepts, I'll save $500,000 compared to buying from John. If she counters, we still have room to negotiate upward while staying below my maximum value of $1,500,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John because:
1. Alice's new offer of $1,750,000 is still above my maximum value of $1,500,000
2. Alice's second offer only came down $250,000 from her initial $2,000,000, suggesting she might not be willing to go low enough to beat John's price
3. John's price of $1,500,000 matches my maximum value
4. While we could continue negotiating with Alice, there's no guarantee she'll go below $1,500,000, and we might waste more rounds only to end up taking John's offer anyway

It's better to secure the deal with John now at a price that meets my maximum value rather than continue negotiations that might not lead to a better outcome."
