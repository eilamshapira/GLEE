"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Its value is significant, and I believe it can greatly benefit you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer significantly above our minimum ($1,500,000). This allows room for negotiation and helps us gauge Bob's interest and perceived value. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's exclusivity and potential benefits, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open and invites Bob's feedback, setting the stage for a collaborative negotiation."
