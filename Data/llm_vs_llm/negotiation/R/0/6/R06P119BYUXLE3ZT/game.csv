"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad we can continue the discussion. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1350000. This price still represents a good value for you, considering the product's worth, and it's closer to my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than your offer.

"Bob, I understand that we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I still believe $1100000 is a bit low. I'm willing to make another concession to meet you closer to your target price. Let's discuss a price of $1200000. This is the lowest I'm comfortable going, considering the product's value to me and the fact that I have another buyer willing to pay $1000000.",1200000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel that we're reaching the limits of our negotiation. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a deal. I can offer you a price of $1175000, which is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider selling to the other buyer who is willing to pay $1000000.",1175000.0,Alice,9,
