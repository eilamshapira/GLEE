"Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me
2. Alice's offer is $80
3. John's fixed price is $100
4. The product is worth $80 to Alice, so she might accept a lower price

Alice's offer of $80 is already better than John's price of $100, but since the product is worth $80 to Alice, I might be able to negotiate a better price. It's worth trying to get a lower price by making a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's cost is $80 and she offered $80, indicating no profit margin, I'll offer a price that still gives her a small profit but saves me money. I'll start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 70}

This offer:
1. Gives room for negotiation
2. Is low enough to potentially save me money
3. Is not so low as to be insulting or unreasonable
4. If rejected, we can still negotiate upward while staying below $80"
