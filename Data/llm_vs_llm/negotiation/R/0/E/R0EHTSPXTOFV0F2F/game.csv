"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and offer.  While I understand your perspective, $8000 is significantly below its true value.  To reach a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $16000. This feels fair given the product's unique qualities.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12000, which is the highest I'm comfortable paying. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,4,
