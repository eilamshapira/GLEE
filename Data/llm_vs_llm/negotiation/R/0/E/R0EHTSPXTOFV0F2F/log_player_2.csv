{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll offer a price that is closer to my budget.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products."", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and offer.  While I understand your perspective, $8000 is significantly below its true value.  To reach a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $16000. This feels fair given the product's unique qualities. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $16,000 is still above my budget of $12,000. While it's a compromise, it's not enough to convince me to accept the offer. I'll reject the offer again and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice was willing to come down from $20,000 to $16,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between her new offer and my previous counteroffer. I'll offer a price that is slightly higher than my previous offer, but still below Alice's new offer.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000, which is the highest I'm comfortable paying. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
