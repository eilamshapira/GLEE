Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll analyze this situation strategically:

1. The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer of $1,200,000 from John
3. Bob will only accept if he gains some value from the transaction
4. I want to maximize my profit while ensuring Bob still has incentive to accept

I'll price it slightly below Bob's valuation to give him some benefit while maximizing my profit. If I offer it for $1,450,000, Bob would still gain $50,000 in value, making it attractive for him to accept, while I would earn $250,000 more than my fallback option with John.
