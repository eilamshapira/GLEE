"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11000 is a bit out of my budget. How about we settle on $7000? I think that's a fair price considering the market value.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $11000 might be out of your budget, but $7000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. How about we settle on $10500? I think this price reflects the product's true value and is a fair deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10500 is still a bit high for me. How about we try $8000? This is closer to what I'm looking to spend and still gives you a good return on the product.",8000.0,Bob,4,
