"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm thinking of selling it to you for a price that reflects its true value."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11000 is a bit out of my budget. How about we settle on $7000? I think that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $7,000 because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer to see if we can meet at a mutually beneficial price. 

My counteroffer is: $10,500. This price reflects the product's value and gives Bob a chance to acquire it at a reasonable cost."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $11,000 might be out of your budget, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. How about we settle on $10,500? I think this price reflects the product's true value and is a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10500 is still a bit high for me. How about we try $8000? This is closer to what I'm looking to spend and still gives you a good return on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

I accept Bob's offer of $8,000. Although it's at the lower end of my acceptable price range, it's a fair deal considering the negotiation process. Since I also have the option to sell to John for the same price, accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal without further uncertainty."
