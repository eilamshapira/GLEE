"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me evaluate Alice's offer carefully.

Alice is offering the product for $14,500.
The product is worth up to $15,000 to me (my maximum valuation).
If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $15,000.

Alice's offer ($14,500) is $500 less than John's price ($15,000), so I would save $500 by accepting Alice's offer rather than buying from John.

Since Alice's offer is below my maximum valuation and better than the alternative option, I should accept it.
