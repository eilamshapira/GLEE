You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is quite high. I should try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7000 is significantly below its true value. I could meet you halfway at $8500. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

This is getting closer, but ""final offer"" at this stage is likely a negotiating tactic. I'll push a little further."

I'm aiming for a price that's her actual value. This might be my best chance for a good deal before I have to consider John's offer."
