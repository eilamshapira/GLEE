"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic offer for you! I'm selling a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm offering it to you for $9500. This is a great opportunity that you won't want to miss! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $9,500 against my alternatives.

The product is worth up to $10,000 to me, and if I reject Alice's offer, I'll have to buy from John for $10,000.

Alice's offer at $9,500 saves me $500 compared to buying from John. Since this price is below my maximum value ($10,000), accepting Alice's offer would be rational.
