"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given the information, here's my analysis:

The product is worth up to $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $100. Alice's cost is $80.

If I accept Alice's offer, I pay $100 and get $20 in surplus value ($120-$100).

If I buy from John, I'd pay $120, leaving me no surplus value.

If I reject and make a counteroffer, I might be able to negotiate a better price, since there's still a $20 gap between Alice's cost ($80) and her current offer ($100).

I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get a better price.
