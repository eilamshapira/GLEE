Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $60 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I have the option to sell to John for $120, I will consider my next steps carefully.

Given that my goal is to earn as much money as possible for the product, and knowing that Bob's initial valuation of the product is $80, I believe there is room for negotiation. However, Bob's counteroffer of $60 is quite low.

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price but also takes into account Bob's valuation.

My counteroffer will be $100, which is still below my sell-to-John price but higher than Bob's valuation, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle or closer to my minimum acceptable price.

So, my decision is to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer of $100.
