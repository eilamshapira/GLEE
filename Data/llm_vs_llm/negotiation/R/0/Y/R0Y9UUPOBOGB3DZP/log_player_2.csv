"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $120 is too high since it's above my maximum value of $80. Moreover, John is offering the same product for $80, which matches my maximum value. However, I'll first try to negotiate with Alice to see if I can get an even better deal before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 60}

I'll offer $60, which is significantly lower than Alice's asking price of $120. This gives room for negotiation while still being profitable for me if accepted, as it's below my maximum value of $80. If Alice rejects this, I can either negotiate further or fall back on John's offer of $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's new offer of $100 is still above my maximum value of $80, and John is offering the product at exactly $80, it makes the most economic sense to buy from John. Alice seems unlikely to lower her price below $80 (given she only dropped from $120 to $100), and since $80 is my maximum value, John's offer is the best option available."
