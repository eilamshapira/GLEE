"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a product that I value at $250. It's a high-quality item that I believe will serve you well. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $250, which is more than the $120 maximum value it has to me. John is willing to sell the identical product for $120, which matches exactly what the product is worth to me.

Since Alice's price is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation and John's alternative offer, it doesn't make sense to accept her offer. I should either make a counteroffer or buy from John directly.

Given that John's price exactly matches my maximum valuation, I won't save any money by continuing to negotiate with Alice unless she's willing to go below $120, which seems unlikely given her high initial offer.
