Let's try to get a better price from Alice, as her initial offer is quite high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $100 seems a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counter-offer provides a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, giving us room to negotiate while still staying well below our maximum budget."
