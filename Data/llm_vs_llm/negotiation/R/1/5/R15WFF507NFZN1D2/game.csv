"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your product, $1450000 is quite close to what I can get elsewhere. The product is valued at $1200000 for you, and I'm looking for a fair deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1250000, which gives you a reasonable profit while allowing me to save compared to alternative options. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. To reach a deal that reflects the value of this product to both of us, I would be willing to lower the price to $1400000. It's a competitive offer, and I'm confident you'll find great value in this purchase.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for lowering your price, but $1400000 is still quite high. Let's try to find a middle ground that benefits us both. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1300000, which gives you a $100000 profit above your $1200000 valuation. This is a fair deal that saves me money compared to other options while ensuring you make a good profit. Does this work for you?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
