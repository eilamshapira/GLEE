Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your product, $1450000 is quite close to what I can get elsewhere. The product is valued at $1200000 for you, and I'm looking for a fair deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1250000, which gives you a reasonable profit while allowing me to save compared to alternative options. What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
