(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I notice Alice's offer is $1,450,000, which is only $50,000 less than John's standing offer of $1,500,000. Since I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, there's significant room for negotiation. I should try to get a better price.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your product, $1,450,000 is quite close to what I can get elsewhere. The product is valued at $1,200,000 for you, and I'm looking for a fair deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000, which gives you a reasonable profit while allowing me to save compared to alternative options. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. To reach a deal that reflects the value of this product to both of us, I would be willing to lower the price to $1400000. It's a competitive offer, and I'm confident you'll find great value in this purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has only reduced her price by $50,000 to $1,400,000, which is still significantly above the product's worth to her. There's still a $200,000 gap between her current offer and her cost, so there's plenty of room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and make a more reasonable counteroffer.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for lowering your price, but $1,400,000 is still quite high. Let's try to find a middle ground that benefits us both. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000, which gives you a $100,000 profit above your $1,200,000 valuation. This is a fair deal that saves me money compared to other options while ensuring you make a good profit. Does this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
