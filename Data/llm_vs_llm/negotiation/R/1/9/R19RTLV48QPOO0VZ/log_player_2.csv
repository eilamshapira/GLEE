"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product that I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's initial offer of $140 is close to my maximum budget of $150, but still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, I'll choose to reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try and negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I don't know Alice's minimum price, I'll start with a price that is $10 lower than her initial offer.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest. How about we meet in the middle at $135? Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's new offer of $135 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but it's getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with. Since I've already made a counteroffer of $130 and Alice rejected it, I'll try to split the difference again and see if we can meet at a lower price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

(I'll make another counteroffer in the next round)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous offer of $130, but still lower than Alice's current offer of $135. I'll try to meet Alice in the middle again, but this time, I'll aim for a price that is closer to $130.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your revised offer. I'm still very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $132. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 132}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued interest, Bob! How about we settle on $133 for the product? I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $133. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $133
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's new offer of $133 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $132, and it's clear that we're getting close to a mutually agreeable price. At this point, I'm willing to accept Alice's offer of $133, as it's only $1 more than my previous counteroffer and it's still within my budget of $150.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
