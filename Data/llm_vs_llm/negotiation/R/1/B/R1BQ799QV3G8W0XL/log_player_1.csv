"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth at least $100 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer of $100, I'll start with a relatively high price to test Bob's willingness to pay.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","I'll reject Bob's offer of $80 since it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and I have John's guaranteed offer of $100. However, I'll continue negotiating with Bob since there are still many rounds left and there's potential for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial price somewhat but still maintain a price well above my minimum of $100, considering Bob's low initial offer of $80.

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer equals John's guaranteed offer of $100, and considering we've already spent 4 rounds negotiating with no significant progress, it would be risky to reject this offer hoping for a better one. Bob's previous offers suggest he might not be willing to go much higher, and we might end up having to sell to John anyway.
