(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(Let's see if Alice can lower her price. Since John is offering the product for $120, there's no reason to accept any offer higher than that.)

Counteroffer: $80"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 80}

(I'm starting with a lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. Since I can buy the product from John for $120, I should try to get a better deal from Alice.)"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Counteroffer: $100

(Alice lowered her price, but it's still higher than what John is offering. I'll increase my offer a bit to see if we can find a middle ground that's still lower than $120.)"

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 100}

(I've increased my offer to see if Alice will accept it. This is still lower than John's price, so it's a better deal for me if Alice accepts it.)"
