"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000.  It's a fair price considering the value and potential benefits it offers. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it for exactly that price. I'd like to do business with you instead if possible. Would you consider $5500 for the product? This would give us both a fair deal and save me from having to go to another seller.",5500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $5500 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $8000. This still gives me a decent profit, and it's a fair price considering the value this product offers.  Let's work together to reach a mutually agreeable solution.",8000.0,Alice,3,
