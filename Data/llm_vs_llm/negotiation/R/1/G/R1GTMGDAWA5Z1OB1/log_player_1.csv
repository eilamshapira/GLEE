"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  It's a fair price considering the value and potential benefits it offers. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it for exactly that price. I'd like to do business with you instead if possible. Would you consider $5500 for the product? This would give us both a fair deal and save me from having to go to another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $5500 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $8000. This still gives me a decent profit, and it's a fair price considering the value this product offers.  Let's work together to reach a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 8000}
