"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000.  It's a fair price considering the value and potential benefits it offers. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","$15,000 is significantly higher than the maximum value of $8,000 that the product is worth to me. It's also much higher than John's guaranteed price of $8,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it for exactly that price. I'd like to do business with you instead if possible. Would you consider $5,500 for the product? This would give us both a fair deal and save me from having to go to another seller."", ""product_price"": 5500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $5500 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $8000. This still gives me a decent profit, and it's a fair price considering the value this product offers.  Let's work together to reach a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has come down to $8,000, which is the same price John is offering and the maximum value the product is worth to me. Since the prices are identical, I might as well accept Alice's offer.
