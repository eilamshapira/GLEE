"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While $900000 is a step in the right direction, it's still significantly below the product's true value. Given the quality and market conditions, I can come down to $1050000, which I believe is a more reasonable price point. This represents a substantial reduction from my initial offer and better reflects the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $1050000. I appreciate the effort to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a compromise at $980000, which I believe is closer to a fair market value and within my means. I'm eager to finalize the deal if we can meet at this price.",980000.0,Bob,4,
