Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Explanation (not part of response): I'll reject this offer because while $900,000 is above my minimum threshold of $800,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob's willingness to offer $900,000 suggests they value the product significantly, and they might be willing to go higher. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price between my initial ask and their current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still significantly below the product's true value. Given the quality and market conditions, I can come down to $1,050,000, which I believe is a more reasonable price point. This represents a substantial reduction from my initial offer and better reflects the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $1050000. I appreciate the effort to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a compromise at $980000, which I believe is closer to a fair market value and within my means. I'm eager to finalize the deal if we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Explanation (not part of response): I'll accept Bob's offer of $980,000. This is a good outcome because:
1. It's significantly above my minimum threshold of $800,000
2. Bob has moved up considerably from their initial offer of $900,000
3. We've had multiple rounds of negotiation, and the incremental increases are getting smaller
4. There's a risk that if I push too hard, Bob might walk away
5. The difference between this offer and my last asking price ($1,050,000) isn't large enough to justify the risk of losing the deal
This represents a good compromise and a profitable deal for both parties."
