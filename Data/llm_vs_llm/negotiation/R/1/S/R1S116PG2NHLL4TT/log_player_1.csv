"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,500 is significantly higher than John's fixed offer of $8,000, but still quite low compared to what Bob might be willing to pay (given the product is worth $10,000 to him), I'll reject and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from the initial $9,500, but still maintain a strong position since I know Bob values the product at $10,000.

{""product_price"": 9200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob has increased his offer to $8,800, which is a decent improvement from his previous $8,500. While there might be room to negotiate further, we're already in round 4 of 10, and $8,800 represents a good profit margin above both my minimum ($8,000) and John's offer ($8,000). Rather than risk the negotiation breaking down or running out of time, I'll accept this offer.
