"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer ($1,800,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000), it would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. The best option is to buy from John at $1,000,000, which matches my maximum valuation and saves me $800,000 compared to Alice's offer.
