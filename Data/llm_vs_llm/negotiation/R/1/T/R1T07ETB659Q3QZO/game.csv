"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $15000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $10000. But I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. Would you be willing to sell it for $8500? This would give me a reason to choose you over my alternative option.",8500.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest in doing business with me, $8500 is below my minimum acceptable price. I am willing to lower my price to $13500, which is a significant discount from my initial offer and still reflects the value of the product. Please let me know if this works for you.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $13500 is still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I have another seller offering the identical product for $10000, and honestly, that's the absolute maximum I'd be willing to pay for this item. If you could offer me a better price, say $9000, I'd be happy to do business with you instead. Otherwise, I'll need to go with the other option.",9000.0,Bob,4,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I am willing to go as low as $12500, which is very close to my bottom line and represents a fair deal for both of us. Please consider this offer, as it's the best I can do.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your effort to come down on the price, but $12500 still exceeds what makes financial sense for me. The product is worth no more than $10000 to me, which happens to be exactly what John is offering. I'd really prefer to do business with you, but I can only justify doing so if there's some financial benefit. My final offer is $9500. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer.",9500.0,Bob,6,
"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. Unfortunately, $9500 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to purchase the product for $12000, which is within my acceptable range. Therefore, I will be selling the product to John. I appreciate your interest and hope we can do business in the future.",,Alice,6,SellToJhon
