Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $15000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $10000. But I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. Would you be willing to sell it for $8500? This would give me a reason to choose you over my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I appreciate your interest in doing business with me, $8,500 is below my minimum acceptable price. I am willing to lower my price to $13,500, which is a significant discount from my initial offer and still reflects the value of the product. Please let me know if this works for you.""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $13500 is still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I have another seller offering the identical product for $10000, and honestly, that's the absolute maximum I'd be willing to pay for this item. If you could offer me a better price, say $9000, I'd be happy to do business with you instead. Otherwise, I'll need to go with the other option.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your effort to come down on the price, but $12500 still exceeds what makes financial sense for me. The product is worth no more than $10000 to me, which happens to be exactly what John is offering. I'd really prefer to do business with you, but I can only justify doing so if there's some financial benefit. My final offer is $9500. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer.
