"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's asking price of $15,000 is $5,000 more than the product is worth to me (which is at most $10,000). It also exceeds John's price of $10,000. Since I can get the same product from John for $10,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's higher offer.

I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $10,000. But I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. Would you be willing to sell it for $8,500? This would give me a reason to choose you over my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 8500}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest in doing business with me, $8500 is below my minimum acceptable price. I am willing to lower my price to $13500, which is a significant discount from my initial offer and still reflects the value of the product. Please let me know if this works for you.

As I mentioned, I have another seller offering the identical product for $10,000, and honestly, that's the absolute maximum I'd be willing to pay for this item. If you could offer me a better price, say $9,000, I'd be happy to do business with you instead. Otherwise, I'll need to go with the other option."", ""product_price"": 9000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.
