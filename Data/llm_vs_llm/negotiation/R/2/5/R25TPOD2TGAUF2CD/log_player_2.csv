"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Based on the information provided, the product is worth no more than $80 to me (Bob), and John is offering to sell it to me for exactly $80. Alice's offer is $150, which exceeds the value of the product to me.

It makes financial sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John instead, saving $70.
