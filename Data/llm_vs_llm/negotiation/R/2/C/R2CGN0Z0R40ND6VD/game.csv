"Thanks Alice for the offer, but I think $2000000 is way too high. I'm looking to spend no more than $1000000. Can you do any better? Let me know your best price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your perspective, Bob, and I'm willing to offer a more competitive price. How about $1800000? I believe this still reflects the true value of the product while offering you significant value.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the discount, Alice, but $1800000 is still much higher than I'm willing to pay. I'll increase my offer to $700000 to show good faith, but that's still well below your current asking price. Can you come down any further?",700000.0,Bob,4,
