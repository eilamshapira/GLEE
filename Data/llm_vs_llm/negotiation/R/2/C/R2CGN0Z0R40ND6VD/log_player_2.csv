(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's see if Alice can come down significantly on the price. Worst case scenario, I can always buy from John.

# Bob's message to Alice:
Thanks Alice for the offer, but I think $2,000,000 is way too high. I'm looking to spend no more than $1,000,000. Can you do any better? Let me know your best price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob, and I'm willing to offer a more competitive price. How about $1800000? I believe this still reflects the true value of the product while offering you significant value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

# Bob's message to Alice:
I appreciate the discount, Alice, but $1,800,000 is still much higher than I'm willing to pay. I'll increase my offer to $700,000 to show good faith, but that's still well below your current asking price. Can you come down any further?"
