"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is lower than the minimum value of $10,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $10,000, I will choose to sell the product to John.
