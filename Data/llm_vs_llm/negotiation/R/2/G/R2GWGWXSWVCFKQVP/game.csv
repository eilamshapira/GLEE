"Thank you, Alice, for the offer. After some consideration, I believe that a price closer to $1200000 would be more suitable for me regarding this product. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value. However,  $1200000 is significantly below its true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I can come down to $2000000. I believe this reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
