"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Evaluating the options:
1. Accept Alice's offer: $15,000
2. Reject and make a counteroffer
3. Buy from John: $15,000

Since Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's price ($15,000), and the product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, there's no advantage to immediately accepting Alice's offer. However, by rejecting and making a counteroffer, I might be able to get a better price from Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price to create room for negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her price from $15,000 to $12,500, which is $2,500 less than both her initial offer and John's price. This is a significant improvement that saves me money compared to my alternative option.

I could try to negotiate further, but Alice has already shown willingness to reduce the price substantially. The current offer of $12,500 represents good value compared to my maximum budget of $15,000, and there's always a risk that continued negotiation could lead to Alice becoming less flexible.
