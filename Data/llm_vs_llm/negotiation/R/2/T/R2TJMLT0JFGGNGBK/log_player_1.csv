Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,400,000. This is a competitive price for an asset of this caliber."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, considering my budget and other available options in the market, I'm willing to buy the product for $900000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

The reason for my decision is that Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Since John is willing to pay $1,200,000, which matches my minimum acceptable price, it makes more financial sense to sell to John rather than continue negotiations with Bob, especially since Bob's initial counteroffer is so far below my minimum threshold."
