"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Given that the product is worth no more than $80 to me, and John is willing to sell it for $80, it doesn't make sense to accept Alice's offer of $100.

Alice is asking for a price that exceeds both the value of the product to me and the alternative offer from John.
