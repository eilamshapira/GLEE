Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price (John), I should set a price higher than $12,000 when offering to Bob.

Without knowing how much Bob values the product, I'll offer a price that gives me a reasonable profit while still being potentially attractive to Bob.
