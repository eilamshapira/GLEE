"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your premium product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000, considering it's still a significant investment for me and within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $900000, I'm afraid I cannot accept it as it's significantly below the product's market value and my minimum acceptable price. Given that I have another buyer ready at $1500000, I'd need to see a more competitive offer. I can work with you at $1950000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true value. Let me know if this works for you.",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer and for sharing the information about the other buyer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $1950000 is still above my budget. Considering the product's value and the presence of another buyer, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer of $1200000 and your continued interest in our product. However, I must be transparent that this is still significantly below what I can accept, especially with John's standing offer of $1500000. While I'd prefer to do business with you, I need to ensure the deal makes financial sense for my side as well. My best counteroffer is $1700000, which represents a substantial discount from my previous offers. This price reflects both the true value of the product and my willingness to work with you rather than accepting John's immediate offer.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
