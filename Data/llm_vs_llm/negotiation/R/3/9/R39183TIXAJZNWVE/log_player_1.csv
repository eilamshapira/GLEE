Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your premium product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000, considering it's still a significant investment for me and within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $900,000, I'm afraid I cannot accept it as it's significantly below the product's market value and my minimum acceptable price. Given that I have another buyer ready at $1,500,000, I'd need to see a more competitive offer. I can work with you at $1,950,000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true value.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer and for sharing the information about the other buyer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $1950000 is still above my budget. Considering the product's value and the presence of another buyer, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer of $1,200,000 and your continued interest in our product. However, I must be transparent that this is still significantly below what I can accept, especially with John's standing offer of $1,500,000. While I'd prefer to do business with you, I need to ensure the deal makes financial sense for my side as well. My best counteroffer is $1,700,000, which represents a substantial discount from my previous offers.
