Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $900000, I'm afraid I cannot accept it as it's significantly below the product's market value and my minimum acceptable price. Given that I have another buyer ready at $1500000, I'd need to see a more competitive offer. I can work with you at $1950000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true value. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000.

However, $1,950,000 is still above my budget. Considering the product's value and the presence of another buyer, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer of $1200000 and your continued interest in our product. However, I must be transparent that this is still significantly below what I can accept, especially with John's standing offer of $1500000. While I'd prefer to do business with you, I need to ensure the deal makes financial sense for my side as well. My best counteroffer is $1700000, which represents a substantial discount from my previous offers. This price reflects both the true value of the product and my willingness to work with you rather than accepting John's immediate offer.
