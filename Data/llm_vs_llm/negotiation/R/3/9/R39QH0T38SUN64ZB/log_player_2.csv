"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully. She's offering the product for $1,200,000, which is $400,000 more than the maximum value it's worth to me ($800,000). If I were to accept this offer, I'd be losing a significant amount of money.

I have an alternative option to buy from John for $800,000, which is exactly the maximum I'm willing to pay. This option ensures I get the product without paying more than its value to me.

While I could reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, there's no guarantee we'll reach an agreement that's better than John's offer, especially since Alice values the product at $1,000,000.

The most rational decision is to go with the guaranteed option that meets my budget constraint.
