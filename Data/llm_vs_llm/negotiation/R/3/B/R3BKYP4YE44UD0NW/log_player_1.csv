Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my options carefully here. The product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at exactly that price if Bob rejects my offer.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I need to make an offer that has a chance of being accepted while still giving me a good profit above my minimum threshold of $1,500,000.

I'll price the product higher than my minimum value to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium:

{""product_price"": $2,000,000}"
