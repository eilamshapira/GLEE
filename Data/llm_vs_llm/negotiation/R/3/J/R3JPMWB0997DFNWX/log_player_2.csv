"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice is offering the same price as John ($1,200,000), and this price is at my maximum acceptable value, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. There's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice, especially since I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to her. If the negotiation doesn't work out, I can always fall back on John's offer later.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's above Alice's cost ($1,000,000) but significantly below the asking price of $1,200,000. This gives room for negotiation while still allowing Alice to make a profit.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,170,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,170,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced her price by $30,000 from her initial offer, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, since we know her cost is $1,000,000, there's still room for a better deal. The current offer of $1,170,000 is still quite high, and since I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000, I'll reject this offer and try another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still try to get a good deal. Since Alice came down to $1,170,000, I'll make a reasonable step up from my last offer of $1,050,000, but still maintain room for negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has now reduced her price to $1,150,000, which is $50,000 less than John's price and $20,000 less than her previous offer. While we might be able to negotiate further, this is a reasonable offer that gives me a good savings compared to John's price. Given that we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and Alice has shown consistent but small movements in price, I'll accept this offer to secure the $50,000 savings compared to my alternative option.
