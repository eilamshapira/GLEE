Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make a strategic offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, that's his maximum willingness to pay. However, he doesn't know my minimum acceptable price (which is $120). I should start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation, but not so high that Bob immediately rejects it.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob rejected my initial offer of $150 and countered with $100, I'll adjust my price downward but ensure I stay above my minimum of $120. I need to maintain my position while showing some flexibility.
