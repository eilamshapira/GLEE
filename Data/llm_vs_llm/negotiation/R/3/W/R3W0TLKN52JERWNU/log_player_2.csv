"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","The offer from Alice at $1,700,000 is significantly higher than the maximum value of $1,200,000 that the product is worth to me. It's also much higher than John's offer of $1,200,000.

Since I can purchase the product from John at exactly its maximum value to me ($1,200,000), which is also $500,000 less than Alice's current offer, the most rational decision is to go with John's offer.
