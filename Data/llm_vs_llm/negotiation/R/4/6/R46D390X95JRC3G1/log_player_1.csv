"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product, I'll start by making a relatively high offer. This will give me room to negotiate and potentially settle on a higher price.

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $5,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and also lower than the minimum value of $12,000 that I have for the product, I will reject his offer.

I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I will make a counteroffer that is lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer.

My decision is to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $5,000, which is quite low, I'll make a counteroffer that is still relatively high, but lower than my initial offer of $20,000. This will show that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth a significant amount.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's new offer of $7,000 is still lower than my minimum value of $12,000 for the product. While it's an increase from his previous offer, it's not enough to convince me to sell at this price.

I'll reject Bob's offer again and make another counteroffer. Since Bob has increased his offer, I'll decrease mine, but not too much, to keep the negotiation going.

My decision is to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than my previous one, but still higher than Bob's offer of $7,000. I'll try to find a middle ground that is closer to my minimum value of $12,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's new offer of $8,000 is still lower than my minimum value of $12,000 for the product. Although he's getting closer, I'm not willing to sell at a loss.

At this point, I have to consider the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob. If I reject his offer again, there's a chance that he might not increase his offer enough, or that the negotiation might break down.

Given that I have a guaranteed offer of $12,000 from John, which is higher than Bob's current offer, I'm starting to think that it might be better to sell to John.

My decision is to reject Bob's offer, but I'm getting closer to selling to John if Bob doesn't increase his offer significantly.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is still lower than my minimum value of $12,000, I'll make a counteroffer that is closer to my minimum value. I'll try to nudge Bob towards a price that is more acceptable to me.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's new offer of $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum value of $12,000, but it's still $2,000 lower. At this point, I have to weigh the pros and cons of continuing to negotiate with Bob.

Since I have a guaranteed offer of $12,000 from John, which is higher than Bob's current offer, I think it's better to sell to John. Bob's offer is not high enough to convince me to continue negotiating, especially since we're running out of rounds.

My decision is to sell the product to John for $12,000, as it's a better deal than Bob's current offer.
