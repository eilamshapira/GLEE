Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's still a significant amount above my minimum.  I'm curious to see if Bob is interested at this price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to accept a price that is significantly below my minimum. I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is still a fair distance from Bob's initial offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this price is attractive enough for Bob to consider, but still allows me to get a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. It's clear that we can't agree on a price, and I'm not willing to continue negotiating. I'll sell the product to John for $15,000. While it's not the ideal price, it's still above my minimum and guarantees a sale."
