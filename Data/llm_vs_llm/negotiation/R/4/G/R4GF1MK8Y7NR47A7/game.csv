"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $25000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's quality and potential benefits it can bring to you. I'm open to negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $25000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $12000 to me, and I can actually purchase it from another seller, John, for that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer $9000 for the product. This gives you a chance to make the sale today rather than having me walk away to the other seller.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, I must say that $9000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and the fact that you mentioned it's worth up to $12000 to you, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer the product to you for $18000, which is still a better deal than what I could get from another buyer. I'm open to further negotiations, but I hope we can meet somewhere in the middle.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $18000 is still well above what makes economic sense for me. As I mentioned, the product is worth no more than $12000 to me, and I can purchase it from John at exactly that price. To make it worthwhile to buy from you instead, I need a better deal than what John offers. I can increase my offer to $10500, which would save me money compared to John's price while still giving you a sale today. If we can't reach an agreement near this price range, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10500 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and the fact that you mentioned you can purchase it from John for $12000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer the product to you for $14500, which is closer to the middle ground and still a better deal than what I could get from another buyer. I'm open to further negotiations, but I hope we can reach an agreement soon.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be clear about my position. If I'm going to purchase this product from you rather than John, I need a financial incentive to do so. Paying more than the $12000 that John is charging doesn't make sense for me, as the product is worth at most $12000 to me. To move this negotiation forward, I'm willing to offer $11000. This still saves me money compared to John's price and gives you a confirmed sale today. If we can't agree on a price at or below what John is charging, I'll have no choice but to purchase from him instead.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're not willing to pay more than $12000, and I appreciate your transparency. Considering the product's value and the fact that you mentioned you can purchase it from John for $12000, I'm willing to make one final compromise. I can offer the product to you for $12000, which is the same price John is charging. This way, you won't be paying a premium to buy from me, and I'll be able to close the deal with you. If this price is not acceptable to you, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down to match John's price of $12000. However, for me to choose to purchase from you instead of John, I would need some advantage to doing so. Since the price is now the same, I'd need a lower price to make it worthwhile. I'm offering $11500 as my final offer. This gives you a guaranteed sale right now, and gives me a small savings compared to John's price. If this doesn't work for you, I understand, and I'll simply purchase from John at the $12000 price point.",11500.0,Bob,8,
