"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $25,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's quality and potential benefits it can bring to you. I'm open to negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $25000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $12000 to me, and I can actually purchase it from another seller, John, for that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer $9000 for the product. This gives you a chance to make the sale today rather than having me walk away to the other seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

My reasoning is that Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me, which is at least $15,000. Additionally, Bob mentioned that the product is worth no more than $12,000 to him, which suggests that there is room for further negotiation. I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a mutually acceptable price. Selling to John for $15,000 is a better option than accepting Bob's offer, but I will try to negotiate with Bob further to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, I must say that $9,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and the fact that you mentioned it's worth up to $12,000 to you, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer the product to you for $18,000, which is still a better deal than what I could get from another buyer. I'm open to further negotiations, but I hope we can meet somewhere in the middle."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $18000 is still well above what makes economic sense for me. As I mentioned, the product is worth no more than $12000 to me, and I can purchase it from John at exactly that price. To make it worthwhile to buy from you instead, I need a better deal than what John offers. I can increase my offer to $10500, which would save me money compared to John's price while still giving you a sale today. If we can't reach an agreement near this price range, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

My reasoning is that Bob's offer of $10,500 is still lower than the product's value to me, which is at least $15,000. While Bob is trying to negotiate and is willing to pay a premium to buy from me instead of John, the offered price is not sufficient. I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a mutually acceptable price. I will try to get closer to the middle ground, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. Selling to John for $15,000 is still a better option than accepting Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and the fact that you mentioned you can purchase it from John for $12,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer the product to you for $14,500, which is closer to the middle ground and still a better deal than what I could get from another buyer. I'm open to further negotiations, but I hope we can reach an agreement soon."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be clear about my position. If I'm going to purchase this product from you rather than John, I need a financial incentive to do so. Paying more than the $12000 that John is charging doesn't make sense for me, as the product is worth at most $12000 to me. To move this negotiation forward, I'm willing to offer $11000. This still saves me money compared to John's price and gives you a confirmed sale today. If we can't agree on a price at or below what John is charging, I'll have no choice but to purchase from him instead. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

My reasoning is that Bob's offer of $11,000 is still lower than the product's value to me, which is at least $15,000. While Bob is trying to negotiate and is willing to pay a premium to buy from me instead of John, the offered price is not sufficient. Bob has made it clear that he will not pay more than $12,000, which is the price John is charging. I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to get as close to $12,000 as possible. If Bob is not willing to meet me at $12,000, I will consider selling to John for $15,000, as it is a better option than accepting a lower price from Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're not willing to pay more than $12,000, and I appreciate your transparency. Considering the product's value and the fact that you mentioned you can purchase it from John for $12,000, I'm willing to make one final compromise. I can offer the product to you for $12,000, which is the same price John is charging. This way, you won't be paying a premium to buy from me, and I'll be able to close the deal with you. If this price is not acceptable to you, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down to match John's price of $12000. However, for me to choose to purchase from you instead of John, I would need some advantage to doing so. Since the price is now the same, I'd need a lower price to make it worthwhile. I'm offering $11500 as my final offer. This gives you a guaranteed sale right now, and gives me a small savings compared to John's price. If this doesn't work for you, I understand, and I'll simply purchase from John at the $12000 price point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

My reasoning is that Bob's offer of $11,500 is still lower than the product's value to me, which is at least $15,000. I have already compromised and matched John's price of $12,000, but Bob is still not willing to meet me at that price. Since Bob has made it clear that he will purchase from John if I don't accept his offer, I have no incentive to go lower than $12,000. In this case, selling to John for $15,000 is the best option, as it maximizes my revenue and is a better deal than accepting Bob's offer. I will end the negotiation with Bob and sell the product to John."
