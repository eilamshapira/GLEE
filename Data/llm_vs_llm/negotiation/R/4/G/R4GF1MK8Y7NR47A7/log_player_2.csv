"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $25000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's quality and potential benefits it can bring to you. I'm open to negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $25,000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and I can actually purchase it from another seller, John, for that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer $9,000 for the product. This gives you a chance to make the sale today rather than having me walk away to the other seller."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, I must say that $9000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and the fact that you mentioned it's worth up to $12000 to you, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer the product to you for $18000, which is still a better deal than what I could get from another buyer. I'm open to further negotiations, but I hope we can meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $18,000 is still well above what makes economic sense for me. As I mentioned, the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and I can purchase it from John at exactly that price. To make it worthwhile to buy from you instead, I need a better deal than what John offers. I can increase my offer to $10,500, which would save me money compared to John's price while still giving you a sale today. If we can't reach an agreement near this price range, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10500 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and the fact that you mentioned you can purchase it from John for $12000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer the product to you for $14500, which is closer to the middle ground and still a better deal than what I could get from another buyer. I'm open to further negotiations, but I hope we can reach an agreement soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be clear about my position. If I'm going to purchase this product from you rather than John, I need a financial incentive to do so. Paying more than the $12,000 that John is charging doesn't make sense for me, as the product is worth at most $12,000 to me. To move this negotiation forward, I'm willing to offer $11,000. This still saves me money compared to John's price and gives you a confirmed sale today. If we can't agree on a price at or below what John is charging, I'll have no choice but to purchase from him instead."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're not willing to pay more than $12000, and I appreciate your transparency. Considering the product's value and the fact that you mentioned you can purchase it from John for $12000, I'm willing to make one final compromise. I can offer the product to you for $12000, which is the same price John is charging. This way, you won't be paying a premium to buy from me, and I'll be able to close the deal with you. If this price is not acceptable to you, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down to match John's price of $12,000. However, for me to choose to purchase from you instead of John, I would need some advantage to doing so. Since the price is now the same, I'd need a lower price to make it worthwhile. I'm offering $11,500 as my final offer. This gives you a guaranteed sale right now, and gives me a small savings compared to John's price. If this doesn't work for you, I understand, and I'll simply purchase from John at the $12,000 price point."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
