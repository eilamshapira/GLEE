Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob.

Given the information:
- The product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me (Alice)
- The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob
- If Bob rejects, I can sell to John for $1,500,000 guaranteed

Since the product is only worth $1,000,000 to Bob, he won't accept any offer above this amount. Additionally, I already have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable value.

Since Bob can't profitably pay what I need for the product, I should offer a price that acknowledges this reality while still giving Bob the option to decide.
