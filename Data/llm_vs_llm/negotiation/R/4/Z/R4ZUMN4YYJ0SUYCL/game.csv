"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $90 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",90.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, $90 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to go down to $220 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",220.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
