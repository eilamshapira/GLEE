"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend. Based on my market research and budget, I would be willing to offer $8000 for the product. This is a serious offer that I believe provides good value for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $8000. I understand that my initial offer was higher than you expected, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I need to find a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm counteroffering at $18000, which I believe is a more reasonable price considering the product's features and benefits.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you reducing your price, but $18000 is still considerably higher than what I can justify spending. I've researched similar products in the market, and while I understand you value your product highly, I need to stay within a reasonable budget. I can increase my offer to $9500, which I believe is a fair price that accounts for the product's features while remaining competitive with market rates.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $9500. I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, I still need to ensure that I'm getting a fair price for the product. Considering your research and market comparisons, I'm willing to make a concession. I'll meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'm counteroffering at $16250, which I believe is a reasonable compromise that takes into account both our perspectives.",16250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price and meet halfway. You've shown good faith in negotiations, so I'll make a substantial increase in my offer. I can go up to $11000, which is significantly higher than my previous offer and represents the upper range of what I can spend based on my budget and market research. There are similar products available at this price point, so I believe this is a fair offer that could work for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your increased offer of $11000. I appreciate your efforts to bridge the gap between our prices. However, I still need to ensure that I'm getting a fair price for the product. Considering your latest offer and the fact that I have other options, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll reduce my price to $15500, which is a significant concession from my previous offers. This price reflects the product's value and takes into account your budget constraints. I believe this is a reasonable offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",15500.0,Alice,7,
