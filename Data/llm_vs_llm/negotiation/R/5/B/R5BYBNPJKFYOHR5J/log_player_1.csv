Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend. Based on my market research and budget, I would be willing to offer $8000 for the product. This is a serious offer that I believe provides good value for both of us.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you reducing your price, but $18000 is still considerably higher than what I can justify spending. I've researched similar products in the market, and while I understand you value your product highly, I need to stay within a reasonable budget. I can increase my offer to $9500, which I believe is a fair price that accounts for the product's features while remaining competitive with market rates.

I reject Bob's offer of $9,500 because it's still below my minimum acceptable price. While I appreciate Bob's willingness to increase his offer, I believe the product is worth more.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price and meet halfway. You've shown good faith in negotiations, so I'll make a substantial increase in my offer. I can go up to $11000, which is significantly higher than my previous offer and represents the upper range of what I can spend based on my budget and market research. There are similar products available at this price point, so I believe this is a fair offer that could work for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

I reject Bob's offer of $11,000 because it's still below my minimum acceptable price. Although Bob has made a significant increase in his offer, I believe the product is worth more. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to see more movement from Bob to reach a mutually beneficial price. Since I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, I'll proceed with caution and consider making a counteroffer that's closer to my target price."
