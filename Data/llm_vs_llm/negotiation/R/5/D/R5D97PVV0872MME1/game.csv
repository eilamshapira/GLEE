"Thank you for your response, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget concerns, I would like to counter your offer. How about we settle on a price of $1200000? I believe this reflects the value of the product well. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1000000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
