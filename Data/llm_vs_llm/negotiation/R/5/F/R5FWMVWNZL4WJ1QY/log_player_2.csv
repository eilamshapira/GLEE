"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $180 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $100 and higher than John's price of $100. It's better to reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 80}

I'll offer $80, which is below both John's price and my maximum value. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially allowing me to save money compared to John's price of $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $150 is still significantly higher than both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). While she reduced the price from her initial offer, it's still not acceptable. I'll reject and try another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 85}

I'll slightly increase my previous offer to $85. This shows some willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price well below both my maximum value and John's price. If Alice continues to reject reasonable offers, I can always fall back on John's $100 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, Alice has only come down to $135, which is still well above John's price of $100. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Alice's offers remain consistently above my maximum value and John's price. Rather than continue this negotiation which doesn't seem to be converging to an acceptable price, it's more rational to take John's guaranteed offer of $100. This ensures I get the product at my maximum acceptable price without risking further rounds of unsuccessful negotiation."
