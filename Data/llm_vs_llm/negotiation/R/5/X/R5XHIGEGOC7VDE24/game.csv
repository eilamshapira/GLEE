"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to consider that?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $60. I understand that $150 might be out of your budget, but I'm afraid I couldn't go as low as $60. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a fair price for the product. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $140, which is the lowest I'm comfortable going.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for your counteroffer of $140. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer of $60 and your offer of $140. How about $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your new offer of $100. I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. Considering your interest in the product and our ongoing negotiation, I'm willing to make a small concession. I can offer the product to you for $120, which is a more significant compromise on my part. If you're truly interested, I hope you can see the value in meeting me at this price.",120.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your latest offer of $120. I appreciate the concession you've made, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not comfortable paying that much. Considering I can buy the product from John for $80, I'm willing to make a final offer of $70. If you're willing to sell it to me for that price, I'm ready to make the purchase today.",70.0,Bob,6,
