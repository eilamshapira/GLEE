"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $60 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $150 and also lower than the alternative offer from John, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $60. I understand that $150 might be out of your budget, but I'm afraid I couldn't go as low as $60. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a fair price for the product. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $140, which is the lowest I'm comfortable going."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for your counteroffer of $140. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer of $60 and your offer of $140. How about $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $100 is still lower than my alternative option of selling to John for $150, but closer to my target, I will reject Bob's offer again and try to negotiate a better price, hoping to get closer to or exceed the $150 threshold.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your new offer of $100. I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. Considering your interest in the product and our ongoing negotiation, I'm willing to make a small concession. I can offer the product to you for $120, which is a more significant compromise on my part. If you're truly interested, I hope you can see the value in meeting me at this price."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your latest offer of $120. I appreciate the concession you've made, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not comfortable paying that much. Considering I can buy the product from John for $80, I'm willing to make a final offer of $70. If you're willing to sell it to me for that price, I'm ready to make the purchase today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's offer of $70 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and he's also mentioned that he can buy it from someone else for $80, which is still lower than my target but indicates he's not willing to go much higher. Given that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150, which is well above both Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price, it makes the most sense to sell the product to John.
