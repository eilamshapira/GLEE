"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: The offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000. It wouldn't make sense to accept an offer that would result in a loss. I can either make a counteroffer to Alice or buy from John. Since I have the option to buy from John for $800,000 (my maximum value), I'll first try to negotiate with Alice to see if I can get an even better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

Rationale: I'll start with a counteroffer of $700,000 for the following reasons:

1. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
2. I know I have a backup option to buy from John at $800,000
3. I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice
4. Starting with $700,000 gives room for negotiation while still being a reasonable offer
5. If Alice rejects this, we can potentially meet somewhere in the middle, still below my maximum value of $800,000
6. If negotiations fail, I can always fall back on John's offer

This is a strategic opening offer that's low enough to leave room for negotiation but not so low as to be considered unreasonable or offensive."
