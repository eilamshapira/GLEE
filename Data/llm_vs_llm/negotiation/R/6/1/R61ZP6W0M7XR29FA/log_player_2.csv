"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $200 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's alternative price ($80). It would not be rational to accept this offer when I have a much better alternative. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer of $70, which is slightly below John's price of $80. This gives some room for negotiation while still being potentially attractive to Alice compared to her $150 value.

{""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $180 is still much higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's alternative price ($80). Since I can always buy from John for $80, there's no reason to accept a price that's more than twice that amount. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer of $75. This is still below John's price but slightly higher than my previous offer to show some willingness to negotiate. However, since I can always buy from John for $80, I won't go above that price.

{""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $160 is still double what I can pay by buying from John ($80) and also well above my maximum value ($80). While Alice is coming down in price, she's still far from a reasonable offer. At this point, I'll reject and make another counteroffer, but if we can't reach a reasonable price soon, I may need to just buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer of $78. This is my final attempt at reaching a deal with Alice, as it's very close to John's price of $80. If Alice doesn't accept a price close to the market alternative, it would be more rational for me to simply buy from John.

{""product_price"": 78}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, it's clear that Alice is not willing to come down to a price near $80, which is both my maximum value and the price John is offering. Even her latest offer of $150 is still almost double what I can get from John. Since we've gone through several rounds of negotiation and Alice's offers remain well above my maximum value, it's time to exercise my alternative option and buy from John for $80."
