"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1800000 is significantly higher than the market value for this product. I need to be honest - I can purchase the same product from another seller for $1000000, which matches my maximum valuation for this item. I'm willing to offer you $900000 for your product, which would save me some money while giving you a quick sale. I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need a more competitive price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
