"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,800,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1800000 is significantly higher than the market value for this product. I need to be honest - I can purchase the same product from another seller for $1000000, which matches my maximum valuation for this item. I'm willing to offer you $900000 for your product, which would save me some money while giving you a quick sale. I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need a more competitive price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
