"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1800000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","The offer from Alice at $1,800,000 is well above both my maximum valuation ($1,000,000) and even higher than Alice's own valuation ($1,500,000). It makes no sense for me to accept this price when I can buy from John for $1,000,000, which is already my maximum value point.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than the market value for this product. I need to be honest - I can purchase the same product from another seller for $1,000,000, which matches my maximum valuation for this item. I'm willing to offer you $900,000 for your product, which would save me some money while giving you a quick sale. I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need a more competitive price."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
