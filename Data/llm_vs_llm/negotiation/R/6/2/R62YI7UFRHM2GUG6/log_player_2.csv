"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $200. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Looking at Alice's offer of $200 for the product, I need to make a decision based on the value to me.

The product is worth no more than $80 to me. Alice's price of $200 is significantly higher than this value, and also higher than John's guaranteed price of $80.

Since John is willing to sell me the same product for $80 (which matches the maximum value of the product to me), and Alice's price is much higher, the logical choice is to buy from John.
