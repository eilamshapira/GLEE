"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to own this product. I believe it holds significant value and can be a great asset for you. I'm asking $300 for it. Let me know what you think.",300.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $300 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $100. I believe this is a fair price, considering I can also buy it from John for $120.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're trying to stay within budget. However, $100 is lower than what I'm willing to accept. Considering its value, how about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $250.",250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $250 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $150. This is a more reasonable price for me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm willing to come down a little more. How about $200? That's the lowest I can go while still feeling I'm getting a fair price for the product.",200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $200 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay a bit more than my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $175. This is the highest I'm comfortable going, considering I have the option to buy it from John for $120.",175.0,Bob,6,
