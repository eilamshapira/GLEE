"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! The product sounds interesting, but that's a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $70 for it.",70.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe the product is worth more than that. I can offer it to you for $160.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks Alice. I understand, but I still can't go that high. My max is really around $80. How about $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer, but I still can't go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your max budget. How about we do $140?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I can't justify that price. My absolute maximum is $80, and I'd prefer to save more. How about we meet at $78?",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I still think the product is worth more than $78. Considering your max budget is $80, I'm willing to make a final compromise. I can offer it to you for $130, but if you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",130.0,Alice,7,
