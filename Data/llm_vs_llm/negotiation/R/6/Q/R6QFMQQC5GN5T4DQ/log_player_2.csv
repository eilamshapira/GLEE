"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to choose between Alice's offer of $12,000 and John's offer of $12,000.

Since both sellers are offering the product at exactly the same price of $12,000, and this price equals the maximum I'm willing to pay, I'm indifferent between them. Neither offer gives me any consumer surplus.

Given that there's no price advantage either way, I'll accept Alice's current offer.
