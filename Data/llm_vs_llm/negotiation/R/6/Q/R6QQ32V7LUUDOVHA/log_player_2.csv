You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer of $20,000 is higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($15,000), I will reject her offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm willing to pay up to $15,000, I'll offer a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to leave room for negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $17,500 is still higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($15,000). Since we are only in Round 3, I have plenty of time to negotiate and try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice rejected my previous offer of $12,000 and came back with a price of $17,500, I'll try to meet her halfway and make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one.

{""product_price"": $14,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $16,000 is still higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($15,000), but it's getting closer. Since we are halfway through the negotiation rounds, I'll consider my next move carefully.

At this point, I can either continue negotiating with Alice or buy the product from John for $15,000, which is my maximum budget. Given that Alice's offer is only $1,000 above my budget, I'll reject her offer and try to make a counteroffer that is closer to my target price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer of $16,000 is only $1,000 above my budget, I'll try to make a counteroffer that is very close to my target price. I'll offer $14,500, which is a small increase from my previous offer of $14,000, but still below my maximum budget of $15,000.

{""product_price"": $14,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $15,500 is very close to my maximum budget of $15,000, but it's still slightly above it. At this point, I have to consider whether it's worth paying an extra $500 for the product from Alice or buying it from John for $15,000.

Given that I can get the same product from John for $15,000, which is within my budget, I think it's not worth paying more to Alice. Therefore, I'll choose to buy the product from John.
