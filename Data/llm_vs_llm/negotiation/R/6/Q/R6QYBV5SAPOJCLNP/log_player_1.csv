Send your offer to Bob.,"I understand that I need to make an offer to Bob for a product that I value at no less than $1,000,000. I know that if Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell the product to John for exactly $1,000,000, which guarantees me this amount.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I need to consider what price would be reasonable to offer. If I set the price too high, Bob might reject it, and I'll end up with $1,000,000 from John. If I set it only slightly above $1,000,000, I increase my chances of Bob accepting while still making more than my minimum acceptable amount.

I'll offer a price that gives Bob some incentive to consider the offer seriously while still giving me a significant premium over my guaranteed alternative.
