"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $170. This is a competitive price for the product's quality. Would you like to proceed with the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to evaluate Alice's offer based on my utility.

Alice is offering the product for $170, but it's only worth up to $120 to me. Paying $170 would mean I'm paying $50 more than the product's value to me, which wouldn't be a good decision.

John is offering the same product for $120, which exactly matches the maximum value of the product to me.

Given these options, it makes the most financial sense to reject Alice's offer and go with John's offer at $120.
