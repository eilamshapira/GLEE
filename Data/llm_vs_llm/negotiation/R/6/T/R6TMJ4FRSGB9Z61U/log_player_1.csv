Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob at a price that allows for some negotiation while ensuring I'll get a good return on my product.

{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $12,000 is $2,000 more than John's fixed offer of $10,000, and it's a reasonable counteroffer to my initial price, I'll accept it.
