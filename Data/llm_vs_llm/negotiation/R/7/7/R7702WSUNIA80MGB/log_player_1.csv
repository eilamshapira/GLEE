Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I really like the product, but considering my alternatives, I'm hoping we can make a deal that works for both of us. How about $110? That seems like a fair starting point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my target price. $110 is too low, and I believe Bob is willing to pay more since the product is worth $150 to him."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $135.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your quick reply. I understand the value you're placing on the product, and I truly appreciate it. To make this work for both of us, how about we settle at $125? I believe that's a fair compromise and within my budget. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. While $125 is getting closer to my target, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob, considering the product's value to him is $150. I'll try to meet him halfway between my previous offer and his current offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle at $130? This is as low as I'm comfortable going, and I think it's a fair price given the product's value.
