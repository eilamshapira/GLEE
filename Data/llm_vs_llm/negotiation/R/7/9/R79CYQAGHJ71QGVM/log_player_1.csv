"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product and I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start with a high offer. 

{""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $400,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value of $1,500,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $1,500,000, I will not accept Bob's offer.

However, I still want to explore the possibility of getting a better deal from Bob, so I won't sell to John just yet.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $400,000, which is very low, I'll make a counteroffer that is still high, but slightly lower than my initial offer, to show that I'm willing to negotiate.

Round 4

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's new offer of $600,000 is still significantly lower than the minimum value of $1,500,000 that the product is worth to me. While it's an improvement over his previous offer, it's not enough to make me consider accepting it.

I'll reject Bob's offer again and try to make another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer is increasing, I'll try to meet him halfway. I'll lower my counteroffer, but still keep it above $1,500,000 to ensure I'm getting a good deal.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's new offer of $700,000 is still far below the minimum value of $1,500,000 that the product is worth to me. At this point, I'm starting to think that Bob may not be willing or able to meet my price expectations.

However, I'll give him one more chance to increase his offer. If he's not willing to meet me at a reasonable price, I'll have to consider selling to John.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offers are slowly increasing, but still far from my target, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous one, but still above $1,500,000. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me closer to my minimum value.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's new offer of $750,000 is still significantly lower than the minimum value of $1,500,000 that the product is worth to me. At this point, I'm starting to think that it's unlikely that Bob will meet my price expectations.

Given that I have a guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 from John, and Bob's offers are not getting close to that, I think it's time to consider selling to John. I'll reject Bob's offer one more time, but if he doesn't make a significant increase, I'll sell to John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offers are still not meeting my minimum value, I'll make a counteroffer that's very close to my minimum value. This will give Bob a clear idea of my bottom line and see if he's willing to meet me at that price.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is the final round, and Bob's offer of $775,000 is still significantly lower than the minimum value of $1,500,000 that the product is worth to me. Given that I have a guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 from John, it's a no-brainer.

I'll reject Bob's offer and sell the product to John for $1,500,000, which is the minimum value I'm willing to accept.
