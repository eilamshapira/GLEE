"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in my product. I'm initially offering it to you at $2000000. I believe this is a fair starting point given its unique value proposition.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out, but $2000000 is significantly above my budget for this product. Based on my market research and the product's value to my business, I can offer $600000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. I look forward to your response.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  To be fair to both of us, I could consider coming down to $1600000. This offer stands as a testament to my willingness to negotiate while acknowledging the product's worth.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1600000 is still significantly above my budget and the market value I've researched. I need to be transparent that I have another option to purchase a similar product for $800000 from another seller. I value doing business with you and would prefer to work with you if possible. I can increase my offer to $700000, which I believe is competitive and fair given the circumstances. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have other options, but I believe this product offers unique value that you won't find elsewhere. While I want to find a solution that works for both of us, I can't accept $700000. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1300000? This recognizes the true value of what I'm offering while hopefully still fitting within your budget.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. While you've made some movement on the price, $1300000 is still significantly above what makes financial sense for my business. To be completely transparent, the maximum value this product provides to my operation is $800000, which happens to match what my alternative supplier is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find common ground. I can go up to $750000, which is very close to my absolute ceiling. This represents a substantial increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in closing this deal with you specifically.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to increase your offer.  I've considered your perspective, and I'm willing to make a significant move to close this deal. My final offer is $1100000.  This is a substantial reduction on my part and reflects my desire to reach an agreement.  I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges the unique value this product brings.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
