Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out, but $2000000 is significantly above my budget for this product. Based on my market research and the product's value to my business, I can offer $600000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1600000 is still significantly above my budget and the market value I've researched. I need to be transparent that I have another option to purchase a similar product for $800000 from another seller. I value doing business with you and would prefer to work with you if possible. I can increase my offer to $700000, which I believe is competitive and fair given the circumstances. What do you think?

While I want to find a solution that works for both of us, I can't accept $700,000. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,300,000? This recognizes the true value of what I'm offering while hopefully still fitting within your budget."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. While you've made some movement on the price, $1300000 is still significantly above what makes financial sense for my business. To be completely transparent, the maximum value this product provides to my operation is $800000, which happens to match what my alternative supplier is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find common ground. I can go up to $750000, which is very close to my absolute ceiling. This represents a substantial increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in closing this deal with you specifically.
