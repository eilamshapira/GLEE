"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in my product. I'm initially offering it to you at $2000000. I believe this is a fair starting point given its unique value proposition. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's initial offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than the product's worth to me ($800,000) and also higher than John's guaranteed price ($800,000). Since Alice's offer exceeds what I'm willing to pay, I should reject it and make a counteroffer.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out, but $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget for this product. Based on my market research and the product's value to my business, I can offer $600,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. I look forward to your response."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  To be fair to both of us, I could consider coming down to $1600000. This offer stands as a testament to my willingness to negotiate while acknowledging the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her offer from $2,000,000 to $1,600,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still double the price I can get from John ($800,000) and exceeds the maximum value of the product to me. Since we still have several rounds of negotiation left, I should continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more favorable price.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still significantly above my budget and the market value I've researched. I need to be transparent that I have another option to purchase a similar product for $800,000 from another seller. I value doing business with you and would prefer to work with you if possible. I can increase my offer to $700,000, which I believe is competitive and fair given the circumstances. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have other options, but I believe this product offers unique value that you won't find elsewhere. While I want to find a solution that works for both of us, I can't accept $700000. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1300000? This recognizes the true value of what I'm offering while hopefully still fitting within your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her offer to $1,300,000, which shows continued willingness to negotiate. However, this is still significantly above John's price of $800,000. Since the product is only worth $800,000 to me at maximum, paying $1,300,000 would result in a loss. We have several rounds of negotiation remaining, so I'll continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more favorable price.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. While you've made some movement on the price, $1,300,000 is still significantly above what makes financial sense for my business. To be completely transparent, the maximum value this product provides to my operation is $800,000, which happens to match what my alternative supplier is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find common ground. I can go up to $750,000, which is very close to my absolute ceiling. This represents a substantial increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in closing this deal with you specifically."", ""product_price"": 750000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to increase your offer.  I've considered your perspective, and I'm willing to make a significant move to close this deal. My final offer is $1100000.  This is a substantial reduction on my part and reflects my desire to reach an agreement.  I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges the unique value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her offer to $1,100,000, which is a significant drop from her initial $2,000,000. However, this is still $300,000 above the maximum value the product has to me ($800,000) and above John's guaranteed price ($800,000). Since Alice calls this her ""final offer"" but it's still well above my maximum, and we have alternative options, the rational decision is to buy from John.
