"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you the product. I can offer it to you for $1400000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is below that threshold, it's a good deal. Additionally, rejecting the offer would lead to buying from John for $1,500,000, which is more expensive. Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option to save money.
