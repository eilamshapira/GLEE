"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1500000 is the same price I can get from another seller. Since I'm interested in doing business with you, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000. This would make it a more attractive deal for me while still providing good value. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, I believe the value of the product is higher. How about I offer it to you for $1350000? I think this could be a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts!",1350000.0,Alice,3,
