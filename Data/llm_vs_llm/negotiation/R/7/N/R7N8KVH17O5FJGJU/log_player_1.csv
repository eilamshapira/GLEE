Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1500000 is the same price I can get from another seller. Since I'm interested in doing business with you, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000. This would make it a more attractive deal for me while still providing good value. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
