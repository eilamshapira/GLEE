"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase my product. I'm offering it for $1500000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer is exactly the same price as John's offer ($1,500,000), and this is also my maximum value for the product, I should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price. There's no downside to negotiating since I can always fall back on John's offer if needed.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a significantly lower offer to leave room for negotiation while explaining my position.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,500,000 is the same price I can get from another seller. Since I'm interested in doing business with you, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This would make it a more attractive deal for me while still providing good value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, I believe the value of the product is higher. How about I offer it to you for $1350000? I think this could be a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has reduced her price significantly from $1,500,000 to $1,350,000, which saves me $150,000 compared to John's offer. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might increase her price or become unwilling to negotiate. Since this is a substantial savings already, and the price is well below my maximum value, I should accept this offer.
