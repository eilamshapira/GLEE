"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is quite high for this product, especially since I can get it elsewhere for the same price. I believe a more reasonable price would be $10000, which would make it a more attractive deal for me. Would you consider this offer?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but unfortunately, $10000 is below my minimum threshold. However, I'm willing to adjust my offer to make it more appealing for you. How about $13500? I believe this price fairly reflects the value and quality of the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,
