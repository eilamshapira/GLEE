Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is quite high for this product, especially since I can get it elsewhere for the same price. I believe a more reasonable price would be $10000, which would make it a more attractive deal for me. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
