,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $40 for the product. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this.",40.0,Bob,2,
"Bob, $40 is too low. I’m countering with an offer of $90 for the product. Please let me know if you accept this new offer.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your negotiation, but $40 is well below the product's value. I’m now offering the product at $100. Let me know if this works for you or if you’d like to propose a counteroffer.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price. However, $100 is still a bit above what I'm willing to pay. I'd like to propose a price of $60 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",60.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is below the minimum acceptable value for this product. I'll be selling it to Jhon for $80 instead.",,Alice,4,SellToJhon
