Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my strategy carefully here. 

If I offer Bob any price at or below $12,000, he would accept since that's the product's value to him. However, the product is worth no less than $15,000 to me, and I'm guaranteed to get $15,000 from John if Bob rejects my offer.

Since I can definitely get $15,000 from John, and Bob values the product at only $12,000, it makes the most sense for me to offer Bob a price that exceeds his valuation. While this will result in Bob rejecting the offer, this allows me to sell to John for $15,000, which is the best outcome for me.
