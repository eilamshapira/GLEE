"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think you would find very valuable. It's worth at least $15000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a discounted price of $13000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a product that can bring significant value to your business.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer against my alternatives.

Alice is offering the product for $13,000, but the product is only worth up to $10,000 to me. Meanwhile, John is willing to sell me the same product for $10,000.

Since Alice's offer exceeds the maximum value I place on the product, and I have a better alternative with John's offer, the logical choice is to buy from John.
