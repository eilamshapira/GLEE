"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $2500000, which represents excellent value given its quality and potential. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $2,500,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $1,000,000

Alice's offer is clearly too high, being 2.5 times more than both my maximum value and John's price. While I could try to negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, since I already have a guaranteed option to buy from John at my maximum acceptable price ($1,000,000), the most rational decision is to buy from John.
