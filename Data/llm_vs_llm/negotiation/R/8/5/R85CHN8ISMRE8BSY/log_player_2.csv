"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer of $14,999 is very close to the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($15,000), and buying from John would cost me the same amount, I would rather save $1 by accepting Alice's offer.
