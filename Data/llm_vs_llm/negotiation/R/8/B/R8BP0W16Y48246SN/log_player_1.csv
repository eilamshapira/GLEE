Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 12000}

Rationale: Since I know I can sell the product to John for $12,000, and the product is worth no less than $12,000 to me, there's no reason to offer Bob a lower price. Even though the product is only worth $8,000 to Bob, which means he will likely reject my offer, I'm not losing anything by making this offer because I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000. Therefore, offering the product at $12,000 is the optimal strategy to maximize my earnings."
