Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this offer:

1. The product is worth $1.5M to Bob
2. My minimum acceptable price is $800K (John's offer)
3. I should start high to leave room for negotiation

I'll start with a price that's closer to Bob's valuation but leaves some room for him to feel he's getting value.

{""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Bob's offer of $1M is significantly higher than John's $800K backup offer
2. However, it's still well below Bob's valuation of $1.5M
3. Since Bob rejected my initial high offer of $1.3M, I can try coming down a bit but still aim higher than $1M
4. There's still room for negotiation since we're far from Bob's maximum value

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round, probably around $1.2M, which would still give Bob significant value while maximizing my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than my initial offer but still significantly above Bob's $1M offer:

{""product_price"": 1200000}

This offer:
1. Shows I'm willing to negotiate by coming down $100K from my initial offer
2. Is still well below Bob's valuation of $1.5M, giving him $300K in potential value
3. Is high enough to leave room for further negotiation if needed
4. Is significantly better than my fallback option with John ($800K)"
