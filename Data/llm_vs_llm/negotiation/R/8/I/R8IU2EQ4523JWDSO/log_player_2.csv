"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a better price than John's $1,500,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Alice values the product at $800,000, so there's a significant gap between her valuation and the current offer.  A counteroffer will allow me to explore if I can secure a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,200,000 is a good deal. It's lower than my initial counteroffer and significantly lower than John's price.  There's no guarantee I can get a lower price in future rounds, and the risk of further negotiation might lead to Alice walking away.  Accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a good price."
