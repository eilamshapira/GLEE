"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's $12,000 but still reasonable. Since my maximum value is $15,000 and Alice's initial offer was already below that, I'll try to get an even better deal.

{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm offering $10,000, which is a reasonable counteroffer that:
1. Gives me more savings compared to both Alice's offer and John's price
2. Might still be acceptable to Alice since it's a substantial amount
3. Leaves room for further negotiation if needed"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer of $11,500 because:
1. It's a good compromise between her initial offer of $12,000 and my counteroffer of $10,000
2. It's significantly better than John's price of $15,000
3. Further negotiation might risk losing this deal, and the savings of $3,500 compared to John's price is substantial
4. The price is well below my maximum value of $15,000"
