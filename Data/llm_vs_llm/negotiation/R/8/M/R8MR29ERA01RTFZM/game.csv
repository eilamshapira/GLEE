"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to start the negotiations at $9500.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I think $9500 is a bit steep. How about we start at $6500 instead?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $6500 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers a lot of value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more appropriate. Would you be willing to consider $9000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand where you're coming from, but $9000 is still too high for me. Can we meet in the middle at $7250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a pretty big gap between our valuations here. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need you to move up some for this to work. Would you consider $8500?",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
How about we settle at $7750? I think this is a fair price for both of us.,7750.0,Bob,6,
