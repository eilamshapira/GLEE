"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $180."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  That's a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

# Explanation:
Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than the product's value to me ($120) and also much lower than my initial offer ($180). Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss. Additionally, selling to John for $120 is a safer option than accepting Bob's current offer. However, there is still room for negotiation with Bob, as we have only completed 1 round out of 10 possible rounds. Therefore, the best decision is to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that my initial offer was a bit high for you, but I'm afraid $80 is too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}

# Explanation:
I chose to lower my offer to $130 because it is above my minimum acceptable price of $120 and is also significantly closer to Bob's offer of $80, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and hopefully encouraging Bob to increase his offer in the next round. This price point strikes a balance between my needs and Bob's, allowing for further negotiation while ensuring that I do not sell the product for less than it is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we try $100?  That's the most I can offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

# Explanation:
Bob's new offer of $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting this offer would result in a loss for me. Since we have only completed 3 rounds out of 10 possible rounds, there is still room for negotiation. I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a new counteroffer, as this may encourage Bob to increase his offer further. Selling to John for $120 remains a viable option if Bob's offers do not improve, but I prefer to continue negotiating with Bob for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for coming up to $100. I appreciate it, but I can't go that low. How about we settle at $125? That way, we both give a little."", ""product_price"": 125}

# Explanation:
I chose to offer the price of $125, as it is only slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This demonstrates to Bob that I am willing to negotiate and hopefully encourages him to increase his offer further. By offering $125, I am signaling to Bob that we are close to a deal and that he needs to increase his offer accordingly. If Bob accepts this offer, I will earn more than the guaranteed $120 from John. If Bob rejects this offer, I can still sell the product to John in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a good price, but I'm on a pretty tight budget.  $100 is really the most I can do.  If you're not able to meet that, I might have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

# Explanation:
Bob has rejected my previous offers and has stated that $100 is the most he can offer. Accepting this offer would result in a loss for me, as it is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Although we have not yet reached the maximum number of rounds (10), Bob has indicated that he might consider other options if I cannot meet his price. This suggests that continuing to negotiate with Bob may not result in a better offer. Therefore, the best decision is to sell the product to John for $120, as this guarantees that I will not sell the product for less than it is worth to me."
