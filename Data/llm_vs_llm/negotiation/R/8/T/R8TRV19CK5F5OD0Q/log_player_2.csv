"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to carefully consider this offer.

Alice is offering me the product for $1,750,000, which is $250,000 more than what the product is worth to me ($1,500,000) and also $250,000 more than John's offer.

Since I can get the exact same product from John for $1,500,000, and this matches the maximum value the product has to me, there's no reason to pay more to Alice.
