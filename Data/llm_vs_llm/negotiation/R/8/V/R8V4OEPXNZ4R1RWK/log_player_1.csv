Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Considering my options:

*   **Accept Bob's offer:** This would give me $60, which is less than I need.
*   **Reject Bob's offer and counter:** This gives me a chance to negotiate for a higher price.
*   **Sell to John:** This guarantees me $100, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Let's re-evaluate the situation:

*   **Accept Bob's offer:** $70 is still less than $100.
*   **Reject Bob's offer and counter:** I could potentially get a higher price, but risk Bob walking away with no deal.
*   **Sell to John:** This guarantees me $100.

Given that Bob's offers are getting lower, it's time to cut my losses and secure a sale.
