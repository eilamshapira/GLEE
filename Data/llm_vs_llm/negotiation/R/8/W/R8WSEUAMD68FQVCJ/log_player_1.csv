{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I have a product I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $200 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my market research and the product's value to me, I can offer $60 for it. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Given that my minimum acceptable price is $120 and Bob is offering $60, I will reject his offer. I will make a counteroffer.
