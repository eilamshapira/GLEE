"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $60 for the product. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 might be a bit much. However, $60 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $130.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $130 is still a bit high for me. How about we try $70? I think that's a fair price considering my budget constraints.",70.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $70 is still too low for me. My bottom line is $120. Can we agree on that?",120.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I see where you're coming from, but $120 is still above what I'm willing to spend. How about we settle at $75? That's the highest I can go while still staying within my budget.",75.0,Bob,6,
