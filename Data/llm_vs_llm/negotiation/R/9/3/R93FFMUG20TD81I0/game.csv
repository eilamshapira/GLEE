Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you a unique product that has a lot of great features and value. I'm looking to sell it for $15000. Let me know if you're interested!,15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer! However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7000 for the product. Let me know what you think!",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I appreciate your response, but $7000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell the product for $13000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $13000 is still above what I'm willing to spend. How about we try $8000? I think that's a fair price considering my budget constraints.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! Thanks for your offer of $8000, but I still can't go that low. How about I lower my asking price to $11500? I believe thatâ€™s a fair compromise. Let me know!",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11500 is still a bit high for me. Could we settle at $9000? I think this would be a good middle ground for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I appreciate your offer of $9000, but I'm still unable to go that low. How about I set the price at $10500? I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's value. Let me know your thoughts!",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your latest offer. I'm really trying to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $9500? I think this is a reasonable compromise given our previous offers.",9500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I genuinely appreciate your offer of $9500, but I still need to aim a bit higher. How about we settle at $10000? I think that's a good price for both sides. Let me know if that works for you!",10000.0,Alice,9,
