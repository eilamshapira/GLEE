,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1200000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product but need to see a price closer to my budget.  How about $900000?  I'm serious about buying, but I need to make this work financially.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $900000. I'm willing to compromise and make a counteroffer. I can sell the product to you for $1100000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with at this point.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1050000?  Let's keep the conversation going and find a solution.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a middle ground. I'm getting closer to my limit, but I'm still open to negotiating. I can offer you the product for $1075000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1075000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm determined to close this deal, but we need to find a common ground. How about $1025000?  This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your continued efforts to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. I appreciate your determination to close the deal. After careful consideration, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I can sell the product to you for $1050000, which is a compromise that I'm comfortable with. I believe this price is fair and reflects the product's value. If we can't agree on this price, I may need to explore other options.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see your point, and appreciate you coming down in price. However,  $1050000 is still slightly above what I'm able to pay. To make this work, I'd need to offer $1037500.  This is a compromise that brings us closer to a deal.  I'm hoping we can find a solution at this point.  Let's make this happen.",1037500.0,Bob,8,
