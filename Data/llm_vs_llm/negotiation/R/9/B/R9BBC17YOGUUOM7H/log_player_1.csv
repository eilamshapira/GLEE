"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start with a high offer to maximize my potential earnings. Considering the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, I'll start with an even higher price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $1,000,000, I will not accept Bob's offer.

However, I still want to explore the possibility of getting a better deal from Bob, so I won't sell to John just yet.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $500,000, which is quite low, I'll make a counteroffer that is still high but slightly lower than my initial offer, to show that I'm willing to negotiate.

{""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's new offer of $650,000 is still below the minimum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me. While it's an improvement from his previous offer, it's not enough to convince me to sell.

Since I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, which is a guaranteed deal, I'm not inclined to accept Bob's offer. However, I'll give Bob another chance to increase his offer.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer increased to $650,000, I'll respond with a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous one, to show that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's new offer of $750,000 is getting closer to the minimum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me, but it's still short. Considering I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, which is a guaranteed deal, I'm not inclined to accept Bob's offer.

However, since Bob is increasing his offer and we're halfway through the negotiation rounds, I'll give him another chance to increase his offer. I'll reject his current offer and proceed to the next round.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer increased to $750,000, I'll respond with a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous one, to show that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'll also keep in mind that I have a guaranteed deal with John for $1,000,000, so I won't go too low.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's new offer of $850,000 is getting closer to the minimum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me, but it's still short. Considering I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, which is a guaranteed deal, I'm inclined to reject Bob's offer again.

Since we're running out of rounds, I'll think carefully about my next move. I could try to make another counteroffer, but if Bob is not willing to meet me at $1,000,000, it might be better to just sell to John.

For now, I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, but I'm getting closer to selling to John.
