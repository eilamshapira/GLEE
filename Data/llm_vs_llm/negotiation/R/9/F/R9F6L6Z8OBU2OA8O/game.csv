"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $60 for the product. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $60 is quite lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. How about we meet at $180?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $180 is still a bit high for me. How about we try $70? I think that's a fair price considering my budget constraints.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $70 is still quite far from what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to feel that the price is reasonable. How about $160?",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. $160 is still beyond what I can afford. Let's try to meet in the middle. How about $75? I believe this is a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that we're still a bit far apart. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to feel that we're getting closer to a reasonable price. $75 is still quite low, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $140?",140.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $140 is still a bit high for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $80? This is the maximum I can go, and it's still within my budget.",80.0,Bob,8,
