"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $300 is quite high for my budget. I can get the same product from another seller for $150. I would be willing to pay $130 for your product if you're interested. This would save me some time looking elsewhere while still giving you a sale today.",130.0,Bob,2,
