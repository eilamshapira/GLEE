"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $300. It's a high-quality item and I think you'll be very happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's offer of $300 is well above the maximum value of $150 that the product is worth to me. Since John is willing to sell the same product for $150, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay, there's no reason to accept Alice's much higher price.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $300 is quite high for my budget. I can get the same product from another seller for $150. I would be willing to pay $130 for your product if you're interested. This would save me some time looking elsewhere while still giving you a sale today."", ""product_price"": 130}"
