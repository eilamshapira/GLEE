"Bob, I believe this product could be incredibly valuable to you, though I understand its worth is ultimately subjective.  I'm initially offering it for $1900000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further.",1900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1900000 is significantly beyond what this product is worth to me. The product's value to me is no more than $800000, which happens to be what another seller (John) is offering. I'd like to give you an opportunity to beat that price. Would you be willing to sell the product for $650000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $650000 is too low for me to consider.  There's clearly a significant gap between our valuations.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I have to be realistic about the product's potential. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1275000?",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for coming down in your price, but $1275000 is still well above the product's value to me. As I mentioned, I can purchase this same product from John for $800000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. To make it worth switching from John to you, I'd need a better price. My offer is $750000. This gives you a reasonable profit while providing me with some savings compared to my alternative option.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have other options, but I need to be fair to myself in this negotiation as well.  Let's try this - I'm willing to come down to $1000000 even. This is my final offer, and it's important for you to know that I'm prepared to walk away and accept John's offer if it's not acceptable.  I believe the product's value justifies this price, but I respect your decision either way.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
