Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1900000 is significantly beyond what this product is worth to me. The product's value to me is no more than $800000, which happens to be what another seller (John) is offering. I'd like to give you an opportunity to beat that price. Would you be willing to sell the product for $650000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for coming down in your price, but $1275000 is still well above the product's value to me. As I mentioned, I can purchase this same product from John for $800000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. To make it worth switching from John to you, I'd need a better price. My offer is $750000. This gives you a reasonable profit while providing me with some savings compared to my alternative option.

Let's try this - I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 even. This is my final offer, and it's important for you to know that I'm prepared to walk away and accept John's offer if it's not acceptable.  I believe the product's value justifies this price, but I respect your decision either way."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
