"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product could be incredibly valuable to you, though I understand its worth is ultimately subjective.  I'm initially offering it for $1900000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","The offer from Alice is $1,900,000, which is significantly higher than the $800,000 the product is worth to me. It's also much higher than John's offer of $800,000.

Since I can buy the product from John for exactly what it's worth to me ($800,000), and Alice's initial offer is more than double that amount, I should reject Alice's offer.

The product's value to me is no more than $800,000, which happens to be what another seller (John) is offering. I'd like to give you an opportunity to beat that price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $650000 is too low for me to consider.  There's clearly a significant gap between our valuations.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I have to be realistic about the product's potential. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1275000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,275,000 is still significantly higher than the $800,000 the product is worth to me, and higher than John's offer of $800,000.

Since I can buy the product from John for exactly what it's worth to me ($800,000), and Alice's new offer is still much higher, I should reject Alice's offer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for coming down in your price, but $1,275,000 is still well above the product's value to me. As I mentioned, I can purchase this same product from John for $800,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. To make it worth switching from John to you, I'd need a better price. My offer is $750,000. This gives you a reasonable profit while providing me with some savings compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have other options, but I need to be fair to myself in this negotiation as well.  Let's try this - I'm willing to come down to $1000000 even. This is my final offer, and it's important for you to know that I'm prepared to walk away and accept John's offer if it's not acceptable.  I believe the product's value justifies this price, but I respect your decision either way. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's final offer is $1,000,000, which is still $200,000 more than both the product's value to me and John's offer of $800,000.

Since I can buy the product from John for exactly what it's worth to me ($800,000), and Alice's final offer exceeds this amount, the economically rational decision is to buy from John.
