Let's find a middle ground. How about:
{""product_price"": 15000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000}

I understand that we might not be perfectly aligned on the price of the product.
I am confident that the product is valuable to you and therefore the price of $15,000 is a fair price for it.
Considering your last offer, I think that this proposed price represents a bigger benefit for you then my last offer."

I'm afraid we couldn't reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I wish you a nice day."
