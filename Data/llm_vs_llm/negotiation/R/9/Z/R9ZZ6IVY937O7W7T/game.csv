,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the quality of the product, $180 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in buying, but I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $80 is too low for this product given its value. I can offer it to you for $150. This is already a significant reduction from my initial price.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $150 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $100. If you're open to that, we can close the deal. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,4,
