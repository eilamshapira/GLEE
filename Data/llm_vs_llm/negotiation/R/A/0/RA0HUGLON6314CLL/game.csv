"Hello Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $15000. This is a unique opportunity to own something that will add significant value to your collection. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $15000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay. The product is worth about $10000 in the market, and I can actually get it from another seller for $12000. I'd like to offer you $10500 for the product. This gives you a fair profit while also giving me a reason to buy from you instead of the other seller.",10500.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your perspective, I believe the value of the product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $14000, considering your interest and the market conditions you mentioned. Let me know if this works for you.",14000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price. Given your interest and to meet you halfway, I'm willing to lower the price to $13000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my desire to do business with you. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I need to be straightforward - I have a firm offer from John for this exact same product at $12000. For me to choose to do business with you instead, I would need a better price. I'm willing to offer $11200, which still gives you a good profit over your cost of $10000 while giving me a reason to buy from you rather than John.",11200.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I see your point about the other offer. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to lower the price further to $12500. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and the offers on the table. Let me know if this is something you can work with.",12500.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand the urgency and the other offer you're considering. To make this deal more appealing, I'm willing to come down to $12200. This price is very competitive and reflects my eagerness to finalize this with you. What do you say?",12200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really do want to do business with you, but your current offer of $12200 is still above what I can get elsewhere. As I mentioned, John is offering the exact same product for $12000. I would need a price below that to justify buying from you instead. My offer is $11500, which gives you a solid $1500 profit margin while giving me a reason to choose you over John.",11500.0,Bob,6,
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate. Given the situation, I'm willing to match John's offer and go down to $12000. This way, you get the product at the price you mentioned, and I still maintain a fair profit. Let's make this happen.",12000.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and the competitive offer you have. To close this deal, I'm willing to meet you at $12000, which is the same price you mentioned from John. This should give you the value you're looking for while allowing me to maintain a fair profit. Let's finalize this at $12000.",12000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for matching John's price of $12000. I appreciate your willingness to be competitive. Since we're now at the same point as my alternative option, I'd like to see if we can find a price that makes us both even happier. I'm willing to close this deal immediately at $11700. This still gives you a very healthy profit of $1700 while giving me a modest savings over John's price. What do you say we wrap this up now?",11700.0,Bob,8,
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. Let's close the deal at $11700. It's a pleasure doing business with you.",,Alice,8,AcceptOffer
