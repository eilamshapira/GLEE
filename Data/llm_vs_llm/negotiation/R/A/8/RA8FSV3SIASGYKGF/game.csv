,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $50. Let me know if we can work something out!",50.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $50 is too low for me to sell the product. I can go as low as $175. Let me know if this works for you!",175.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand $175 might still be a stretch. How about we settle at $160? This is the best I can do while still valuing the product appropriately. Let me know what you think!",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $160, but it's still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your current one. How about $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $105 is still below what I can accept. I can lower my price to $155, which is very close to my bottom line. Let me know if this works for you!",155.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. I can go down to $152, which is really my final offer. Let me know if you can accept this price!",152.0,Alice,5,
