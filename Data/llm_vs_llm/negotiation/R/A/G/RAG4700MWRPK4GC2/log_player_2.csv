"Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Based on the information provided, Alice's offer is $3,000,000, which exceeds the maximum value of $1,500,000 that the product is worth to you. John is offering the same product for $1,500,000, which is exactly at your maximum value point.

Since your goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, the rational choice would be to buy from John rather than accept Alice's higher price.
