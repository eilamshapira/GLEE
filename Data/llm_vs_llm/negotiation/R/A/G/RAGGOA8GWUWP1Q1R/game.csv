"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $60 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120?",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $120 is still too high for me. I can go up to $70. Let me know if that works for you.",70.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $100? That's the lowest I can realistically go.",100.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $100 is still above what I'm willing to spend. I can offer $75 as my final offer. If that doesn't work, I'll have to look elsewhere.",75.0,Bob,6,
