"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you that I believe will be of great value to your business. I'm offering you my product, which I know you've been considering, at a price that's sure to be attractive. Let's discuss a price of $1400000. This is a significant discount from its true market value, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a very lucrative investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to negotiate a price significantly above her valuation. While $1,400,000 is less than your absolute limit, there's room to push for a better deal.  Rejecting her offer opens the door for further negotiation or forces her to consider a lower price."
