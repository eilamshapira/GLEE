"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $12000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective on the price, $6000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $9000? I believe that's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $9000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $7000? I think that's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $7000.  Would you consider $8500? This is my final offer.",8500.0,Alice,5,
