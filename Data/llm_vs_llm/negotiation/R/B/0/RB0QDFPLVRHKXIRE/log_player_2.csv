"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $15,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000). It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price from Alice. If the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory price, I can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 10000}

I'll offer $10,000 for the product. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation because:
1. It's below John's price of $12,000, giving me room to negotiate upward if necessary
2. It might be acceptable to Alice if her costs are lower than this
3. If Alice rejects this, we can still negotiate to a higher price, while keeping John's $12,000 offer as a backup"
