Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this:
1. The product is worth $12,000 to me (my minimum)
2. It's worth $8,000 to Bob
3. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $12,000

Since I know Bob values it at $8,000, he won't accept anything above that. However, I also know I can always sell to John for $12,000, so there's no reason for me to sell below that price. Therefore, I'll start with a high offer to see Bob's reaction.
