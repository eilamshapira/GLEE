"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1800000.  I'm open to discussing this further and understanding your perspective on its value.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I recognize the value of the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1200000. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider the initial offer and for providing your perspective. While $1200000 is a significant sum, it doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm confident that you'll see a significant return on this investment.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1600000.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1600000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a little high for my budget. Would you consider $1350000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we are getting closer.  I'm willing to come down slightly more to $1500000. I believe this price accurately reflects the value and potential this product offers, especially considering the returns you'll see.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
