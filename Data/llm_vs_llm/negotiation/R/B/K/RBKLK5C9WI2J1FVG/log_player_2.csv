{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll offer a price that is closer to my target price of $120.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that we're trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle on $130? This is a fair price and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $130 is still higher than my target price of $120. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $120, I don't see a reason to accept Alice's offer. I'll reject her offer again and try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer of $130 is still higher than my target price, I'll try to meet her halfway between her previous offer and my previous counteroffer. I offered $100 earlier, and she offered $130, so I'll try $110 this time.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $122 is very close to my target price, but it's still $2 higher than what I'm willing to pay. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $120, which is lower than Alice's offer, I think it's a better deal for me.
