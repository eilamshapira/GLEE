"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $20000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $20000 is significantly above my budget. The product's value to me is closer to $5000. Would you consider selling it for that price?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget, but I'm afraid $5000 is too low for me to consider. Given the product's exceptional value, I'm willing to compromise and lower my initial price. I'd like to offer it to you for $17000, which is still a fair price considering its worth. I'm open to further negotiations, but I hope you can meet me closer to this price point.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I understand the product has value to you, but $17000 is still beyond what I can justify. My maximum is $7000. Could we meet somewhere in the middle?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $7000. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. Considering your maximum is $7000, I'm willing to make a significant concession and meet you closer to the middle. I'd like to offer the product to you for $12000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with so far. I hope this is something you can consider.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really want to make this deal, but $12000 is still too high for me. I can offer $9000. This is my final offer.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $9000. I understand you said it's your final offer, but I'd like to make one more attempt to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering we're close, I'm willing to meet you almost in the middle between your offer and John's offer, which I have as an alternative. I'd like to offer the product to you for $9800. If this is still not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",9800.0,Alice,7,
