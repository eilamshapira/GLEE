"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $20,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $20000 is significantly above my budget. The product's value to me is closer to $5000. Would you consider selling it for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $5,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. Selling to John for $10,000 is a better option than accepting Bob's offer, but I want to try to negotiate a better price with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget, but I'm afraid $5,000 is too low for me to consider. Given the product's exceptional value, I'm willing to compromise and lower my initial price. I'd like to offer it to you for $17,000, which is still a fair price considering its worth. I'm open to further negotiations, but I hope you can meet me closer to this price point."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand the product has value to you, but $17000 is still beyond what I can justify. My maximum is $7000. Could we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer of $7,000 is an improvement from his previous offer, it's still lower than what I'm willing to accept. Since I have the option to sell to John for $10,000, I'll continue to negotiate with Bob to try to get a better price. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can meet closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $7,000. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. Considering your maximum is $7,000, I'm willing to make a significant concession and meet you closer to the middle. I'd like to offer the product to you for $12,000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with so far. I hope this is something you can consider."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really want to make this deal, but $12000 is still too high for me. I can offer $9000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Although Bob claims this is his final offer, I'm not convinced that he won't be willing to negotiate further. However, considering his offer of $9,000 is close to John's offer of $10,000, I'll try to make one more counteroffer to see if I can get a better price. If Bob still refuses, I can always sell to John for $10,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $9,000. I understand you said it's your final offer, but I'd like to make one more attempt to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering we're close, I'm willing to meet you almost in the middle between your offer and John's offer, which I have as an alternative. I'd like to offer the product to you for $9,800. If this is still not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 9800}"
