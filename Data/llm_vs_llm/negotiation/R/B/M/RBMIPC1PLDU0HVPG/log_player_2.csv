# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $20000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget, but I'm afraid $5000 is too low for me to consider. Given the product's exceptional value, I'm willing to compromise and lower my initial price. I'd like to offer it to you for $17000, which is still a fair price considering its worth.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $7000. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. Considering your maximum is $7000, I'm willing to make a significant concession and meet you closer to the middle. I'd like to offer the product to you for $12000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with so far. I hope this is something you can consider.

# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $9000. I understand you said it's your final offer, but I'd like to make one more attempt to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering we're close, I'm willing to meet you almost in the middle between your offer and John's offer, which I have as an alternative. I'd like to offer the product to you for $9800. If this is still not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.
