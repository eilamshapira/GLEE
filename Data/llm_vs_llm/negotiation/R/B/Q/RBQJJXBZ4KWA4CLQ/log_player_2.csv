"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $30,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $30,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me. Alice's initial offer of $30,000 is far too high. Buying from John is an option at $12,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I want to start with a significantly lower offer, but not so low that Alice immediately walks away. I'll aim for a price that suggests I'm serious but leaves room for negotiation.
