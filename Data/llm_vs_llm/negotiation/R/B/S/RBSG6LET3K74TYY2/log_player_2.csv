"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Okay, let's analyze this:

*   **Alice's Offer:** $14,000
*   **My Valuation:** $15,000 (maximum I'm willing to pay)
*   **John's Offer:** $15,000
*   **Alice's Cost:** $10,000

I want to save money, and I know the product is worth at least $10,000 to Alice.

*   **Option 1: Accept Alice's offer** This gets me the product for $14,000.

*   **Option 2: Reject and Counteroffer:** This is risky. Alice might raise the price if she rejects my offer.

*   **Option 3: Buy from John:** This costs me $15,000, which is the most I'm willing to pay.

Since I can get the product for $14,000 from Alice, which is less than what I'm willing to pay ($15,000), and I don't want to take the risk, I should accept Alice's offer.
