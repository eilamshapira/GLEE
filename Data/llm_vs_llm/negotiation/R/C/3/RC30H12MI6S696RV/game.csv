"Hello Bob, I have a unique product that is of considerable value. This product has cost me $1000000 to develop and brings significant benefits to its owner. I'm offering it to you first at $1500000. This price reflects the product's true value and potential return on investment. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on this offer.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the information about your development costs and the potential benefits. However, $1500000 is a bit high for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, reflecting its development costs and a fair profit margin for you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but $1000000 is my absolute bottom line as that represents my cost basis for the product. Given the unique value and potential ROI this product offers, I believe a fair price would be $1300000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still acknowledging the premium value this product delivers over basic cost. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I'm compensated appropriately for the innovation and value this product represents.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still very interested in this product, but I'm not quite ready to go to $1300000.  I'm willing to go up to $1150000.  This reflects the value I see in the product while still ensuring a reasonable profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
