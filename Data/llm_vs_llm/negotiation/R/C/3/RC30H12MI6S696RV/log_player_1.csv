Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is my absolute bottom line as that represents my cost basis for the product. Given the unique value and potential ROI this product offers, I believe a fair price would be $1,300,000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still acknowledging the premium value this product delivers over basic cost.
