**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is the maximum I'm willing to pay.  There's no reason to accept it immediately. I will try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the information about your development costs and the potential benefits. However, $1,500,000 is a bit high for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, reflecting its development costs and a fair profit margin for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but $1000000 is my absolute bottom line as that represents my cost basis for the product. Given the unique value and potential ROI this product offers, I believe a fair price would be $1300000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still acknowledging the premium value this product delivers over basic cost. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I'm compensated appropriately for the innovation and value this product represents. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price,  $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm not convinced that the product is worth that much more than its development costs. I'll try to negotiate further."

This reflects the value I see in the product while still ensuring a reasonable profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
