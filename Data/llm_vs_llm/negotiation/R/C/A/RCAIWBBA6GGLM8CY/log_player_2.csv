"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $20,000 against my alternatives.

Given that:
- The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
- John is willing to sell the same product for $12,000
- Alice's offer is $20,000, which is significantly higher than both my valuation and John's price

Alice's current offer of $20,000 is not beneficial to me as it exceeds what I'm willing to pay. While I could make a counteroffer, I already have a guaranteed option to purchase from John at $12,000, which matches my maximum valuation.
