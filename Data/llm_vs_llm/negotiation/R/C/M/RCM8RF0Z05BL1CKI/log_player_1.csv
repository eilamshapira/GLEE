Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2,500,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I was thinking of a much lower price. How about $400000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $400,000 is significantly lower than my initial price and even lower than the guaranteed sale price to John, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. My goal is to earn as much money as I can for the product.

Here's my counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $2,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I believe the product's value is much higher than your initial offer."", ""product_price"": 2200000}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you value the product highly, but I need to stay within my budget. I can increase my offer to $500000. This is still significantly lower than your asking price, but I believe it's a fair compromise.

Since Bob's offer of $500,000 is still significantly lower than my initial price and even lower than the guaranteed sale price to John, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. However, I will try to be more realistic and flexible in my next offer to see if we can meet in the middle.

Here's my counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Thank you for increasing your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still far from my target price. I'm willing to make a bigger concession this time. How about we meet at $1,800,000?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your concession, but I'm afraid that's still too high for me. I can raise my offer to $600000. I understand that we're still far apart, but I hope we can find some common ground.

Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is still significantly lower than my target price and the guaranteed sale price to John, I will reject his offer. However, I will try to be even more realistic and flexible in my next offer to see if we can meet in the middle.

Considering the large gap between our offers, I will make a more substantial concession this time. Here's my counteroffer:
