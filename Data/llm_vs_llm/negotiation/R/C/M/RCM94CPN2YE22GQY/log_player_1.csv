Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000). This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential valuation of the product.
*   **Upside Potential:** If Bob accepts, I make a substantial profit.
*   **Negotiation Room:** If Bob rejects, I have plenty of room to negotiate downwards in subsequent rounds. The first offer sets the anchor, hopefully higher than Bob's initial valuation.
*   **Backup Plan:** I always have the option to sell to John for $800,000, so I can afford to be patient and strategic. I won't accept any offer lower than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is above my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer. I believe there's room to negotiate further and potentially extract more value from Bob. Selling to John for $800,000 is a guaranteed option, but I'm willing to risk another round to potentially earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Moving Down, But Not Too Much:** I'm lowering the price from my initial offer of $1,200,000, but I'm still keeping it well above Bob's $900,000 offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also signals that I believe the product is worth more than his current valuation.
*   **Maintaining Anchoring:** By staying above $1,000,000, I'm trying to anchor his expectations around that price point.
*   **Assessing His Reaction:** This counteroffer will help me better understand how serious Bob is and how much he truly values the product. His reaction will inform my future strategy.
*   **Always Remembering the Floor:** I'm keeping the $800,000 fallback price to John firmly in mind. I won't let the negotiation drag on indefinitely or accept a price lower than that."
