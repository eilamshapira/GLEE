"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm offering it to you for $19999. This product is in high demand, and I have another buyer willing to pay top dollar. Don't miss out on this opportunity! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you're willing to pay. It makes much more sense to reject her offer and go with John's offer of $15,000."
