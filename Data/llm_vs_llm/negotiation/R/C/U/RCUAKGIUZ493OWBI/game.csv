"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I think your initial price is quite high. The market value for similar products is significantly lower. I'd like to offer $800000 for the product, which I believe is fair based on my research of comparable items. I'm looking forward to doing business with you, but need a more competitive price than what John is offering me.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on market value, this product possesses unique qualities that set it apart from comparable items. I'm willing to be flexible, however. How about we meet in the middle at $1100000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for being flexible, Alice. I appreciate you coming down on the price, which shows we're making progress. However, there's still quite a gap between our positions. I've done additional market research, and considering the current market conditions, I can go up to $900000. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer and would allow us to close this deal promptly. I value your time and hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I acknowledge your increased offer and the research you've conducted. I, too, value your time and want to find a solution. Given the product's specific advantages and the potential return on investment, I can come down to $1050000. This is my best offer at this time.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down further on the price. We're getting closer to finding common ground. After careful consideration of the product's features and current market conditions, I can offer $975000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and is much closer to your position. I believe this is a fair price that recognizes the product's value while also acknowledging my budget constraints. I'm hoping we can finalize this deal and begin a productive business relationship.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, your continued increases are encouraging. We're definitely nearing an agreement. Given your dedication to this purchase, I'm willing to meet you closer to your offer, but I also need to ensure I'm realizing a fair return on this unique product. My final offer to you is $1025000. If this works for you, we have a deal.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
