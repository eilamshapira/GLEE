Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I think your initial price is quite high. The market value for similar products is significantly lower. I'd like to offer $800000 for the product, which I believe is fair based on my research of comparable items. I'm looking forward to doing business with you, but need a more competitive price than what John is offering me.
