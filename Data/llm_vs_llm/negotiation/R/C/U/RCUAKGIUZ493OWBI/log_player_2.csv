Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is exactly the maximum value it's worth to me and exactly the same price John is offering. Since there's no advantage to buying from Alice at this price (compared to John's offer), and there's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice, I should reject this initial offer and make a counteroffer.

Alice's offer:
