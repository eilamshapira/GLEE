"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I will analyze the situation:

*   **Alice's offer:** $11,500
*   **My Value:** $12,000 (maximum I'm willing to pay)
*   **John's offer:** $12,000

Since Alice's offer of $11,500 is lower than my maximum willingness to pay ($12,000), and I can potentially negotiate a lower price, I will reject the offer and send a counteroffer.

Therefore, the best decision is: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let's analyze the new situation:

*   **Alice's offer:** $11,200
*   **My Value:** $12,000
*   **John's offer:** $12,000

Alice's current offer is $11,200. Since I am willing to pay up to $12,000, accepting Alice's offer is the better option as the price is lower than John's offer of $12,000. I might try to negotiate further, but the risk is Alice might not agree and I will have to buy from John. So, it's better to accept Alice's offer.

Therefore, the best decision is: {""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
