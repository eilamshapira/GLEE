"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me
2. Alice's current offer is $14,500
3. John's fixed price is $15,000
4. The product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation
5. We have 10 rounds available

Alice's first offer of $14,500 is only slightly below John's price of $15,000, and since I know the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, there should be room for a better deal. It's only the first round, so I can afford to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, and I'd like to save as much money as possible while still making a reasonable offer, I'll propose a price that's between our positions but closer to Alice's cost.

{""product_price"": 13000}

This offer would give Alice a $1,000 profit while still saving me $2,000 compared to John's price. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it leaves room for movement if needed while still being a fair offer that's well above Alice's cost."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let's analyze the situation:

1. Alice has moved down from $14,500 to $14,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. This is a $500 reduction from her initial offer
3. We still have 7 more rounds possible
4. The gap between Alice's cost ($12,000) and current offer ($14,000) is still $2,000
5. John's price remains at $15,000 as our backup option

Since Alice has shown flexibility by reducing her price and we still have several rounds to negotiate, and there's still significant room between her cost and current offer, I'll reject this offer to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has moved down $500 from her initial offer, so I should also show some flexibility by moving up from my previous offer of $13,000. I want to show willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a good deal.

{""product_price"": 13400}

This counteroffer:
1. Shows movement from my previous offer ($400 increase)
2. Maintains a reasonable profit for Alice ($1,400 above her cost)
3. Still saves me a significant amount compared to John's price
4. Leaves room for further negotiation if needed
5. Demonstrates good faith by moving closer to Alice's position"
