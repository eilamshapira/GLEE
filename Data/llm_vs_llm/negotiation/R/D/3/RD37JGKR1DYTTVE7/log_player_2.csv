"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $1,500,000
2. John's fixed price is $1,500,000
3. The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me
4. Alice's cost is $1,000,000

Alice's offer is the same as John's price, and it's at my maximum value. Since both options cost the same, and the product is worth that amount to me, I might as well accept Alice's offer. There's no advantage in rejecting it or buying from John.
