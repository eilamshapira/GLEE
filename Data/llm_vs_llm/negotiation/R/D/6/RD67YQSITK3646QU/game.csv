"Hello Bob, I hope you're doing well. I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $115. This is a fair price considering its quality and worth. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand budget constraints, I need to consider the true value of this product. I can reduce my initial offer to $110, which I believe is a fair compromise. This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to receive reasonable compensation for the product. Does that work for you?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $110 is still a bit high for me. Could you go down to $107? I think that would be a great deal for both of us.",107.0,Bob,4,
