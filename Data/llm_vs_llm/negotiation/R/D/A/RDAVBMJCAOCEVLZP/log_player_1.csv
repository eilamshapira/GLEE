"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that I know the product is worth at least $15,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a high initial offer to test Bob's willingness to pay and leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $8,000 as it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 (John's offer). Since Bob's opening counteroffer is so low, I'll continue negotiating but lower my asking price somewhat to show flexibility.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's initial offer was quite low at $8,000, I'll reduce my price somewhat from my initial $25,000, but still maintain a high price point since I have John's guaranteed $15,000 offer as a backup.

{""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's new offer of $9,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and his small increase from $8,000 to $9,000 suggests he may not be willing to reach a price point that would be acceptable to me. Given that we've already gone through 4 rounds with little progress, and I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, I'll end the negotiation with Bob and take John's offer.
