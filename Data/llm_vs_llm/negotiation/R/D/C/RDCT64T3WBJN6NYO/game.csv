"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $70 for it.  What do you think?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I understand your perspective, $70 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I believe that's a fair compromise.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $85? This is a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",85.0,Bob,4,
