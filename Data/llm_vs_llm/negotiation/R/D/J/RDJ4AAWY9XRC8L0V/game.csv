"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its features and value, I'm pricing it at $300. This product is in excellent condition and worth every penny. Would you like to purchase it at this price?",300.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, $300 is far above my budget. I'd like to offer $90 for the product instead.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in my product. However, $90 is significantly below its value. This product is worth at least $150 to me, and I have another buyer (John) willing to pay that amount. Given the quality and condition of this item, I can come down to $250. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer and reflects the true value of the product.",250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the revised offer, Alice, but $250 is still out of my budget. I can offer $100 for the product. I hope we can find a middle ground.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I have John willing to pay $150, which is my absolute minimum. However, I'd prefer to sell to you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can come down to $200, which is still a significant discount from my initial price. This is a quality product that will serve you well and is worth this investment.",200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued offers, Alice. However, $200 is still above my budget. I can offer $110 for the product, which is the best I can do.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but I must be transparent that $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price. As I mentioned, I have John ready to purchase at $150. If we're going to make a deal, I need at least $175. This is my final significant discount, considering the product's quality and actual market value. I'd really prefer to sell to you, but I can't go below a reasonable price point.",175.0,Alice,7,
