"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $12000 is higher than I was hoping to pay. The market value for similar products is closer to $9000, and I'd be comfortable paying $9500 for yours. This gives you a good profit margin while still being reasonable for me. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. I understand your perspective on the market value, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? It's a good price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can increase my offer to $10000, which I think is fair and gives you a good profit margin of $2000 above your cost. This seems like a win-win for both of us. What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,4,
