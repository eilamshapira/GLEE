"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $12000 is higher than I was hoping to pay. The market value for similar products is closer to $9000, and I'd be comfortable paying $9500 for yours. This gives you a good profit margin while still being reasonable for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can increase my offer to $10000, which I think is fair and gives you a good profit margin of $2000 above your cost. This seems like a win-win for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
