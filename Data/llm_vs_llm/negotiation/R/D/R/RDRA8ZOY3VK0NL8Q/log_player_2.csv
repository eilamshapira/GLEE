"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's offer of $12,000 is a bit high. While it's below my maximum of $15,000, I know the product is only worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $12,000 is higher than I was hoping to pay. The market value for similar products is closer to $9,000, and I'd be comfortable paying $9,500 for yours. This gives you a good profit margin while still being reasonable for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. I understand your perspective on the market value, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? It's a good price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer of $12,000 to $10,500, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This price is well below my maximum of $15,000, but I think there's still some room to negotiate since the product is worth $8,000 to her. I'll reject and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can increase my offer to $10,000, which I think is fair and gives you a good profit margin of $2,000 above your cost. This seems like a win-win for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
