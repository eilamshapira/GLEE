Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Considering its unique qualities and the significant investment made in its development, I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's qualities, your asking price matches what I can get from other sellers in the market. I'd like to propose $800000 for the product, which I believe is a fair value considering current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","This is a tough spot. Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price.

I have to consider that if I reject, Bob might not go higher, and I could end up selling for less or wasting time. Selling to John guarantees $800,000, but I have a chance to earn more.

Given the risk involved, I choose to:
