"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is twice the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($10,000), it's not a good deal for me. I'd like to try to negotiate a better price. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm willing to pay up to $10,000, I'll offer half of that amount to see how Alice responds.
