"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'm considering Alice's offer of $11,999 against John's fixed price of $12,000.

Alice's offer is only $1 cheaper than John's price. While technically this saves me money, the savings are minimal. However, since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, even a $1 saving is better than nothing.

The product is worth up to $12,000 to me, so Alice's offer is acceptable.
