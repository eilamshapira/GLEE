"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18000 is significantly above my budget. I know this product is available elsewhere for $15000, but I'd like to work with you. I can offer $12000 for the product. This would give us both a fair deal.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to work with me, and I understand your concerns about the price. However, I believe the product's quality justifies a higher price. I can offer it to you for $16500. Let me know if this works for you.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I still can't justify paying $16500 when I can get the same product elsewhere for $15000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer $13500, which would save me some money while still giving you a reasonable profit.",13500.0,Bob,4,
