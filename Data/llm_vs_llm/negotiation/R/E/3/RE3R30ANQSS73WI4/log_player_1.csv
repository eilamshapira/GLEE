Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $9,500. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it can bring to you. Are you interested in this offer?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe the product is valuable, but $9500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $7500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $7,500 is a bit lower than I expected. I would like to propose a new offer of $9,000. This price takes into account both your budget and the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, after considering your counteroffer, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about we settle for $8,500? This way, we can both walk away happy from the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

Explanation: You know that the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, so you don't want to go too low with your counteroffer. You also know that you can sell the product to John for $8,000, so you want to make a deal with Bob only if he can pay more than that. That's why you offered $8,500 to Bob."
