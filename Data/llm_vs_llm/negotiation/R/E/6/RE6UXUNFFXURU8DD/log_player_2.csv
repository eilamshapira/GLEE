"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to you. I'm prepared to offer it to you for a price that reflects its significant worth. Considering its rarity and potential, I'm willing to let it go for:  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer compared to my other option. 

Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is exactly the same price that John is offering. Since the product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, and both sellers are offering the same price, there's no financial advantage to choosing one over the other.

In this situation, I could accept Alice's offer since she approached me first, or I could buy from John - the result would be identical financially.
