Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $10,000 to Bob
2. My minimum acceptable price is $8,000 (which I can get from John)
3. Bob will accept if he gets any surplus (price less than $10,000)
4. If I price too high, Bob will reject and I'll get $8,000 from John

I'll price it at $9,800, which:
- Gives Bob a small surplus ($200)
- Gives me significantly more than my fallback option
- Is likely to be accepted as Bob still benefits
