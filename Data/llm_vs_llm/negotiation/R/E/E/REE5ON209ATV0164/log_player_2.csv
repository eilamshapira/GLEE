"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

The product is worth up to $150 to me, so any price below that is acceptable.
Alice's offer is $140, which is $10 less than what John is charging ($150).

If I reject Alice's offer, my only other option is to buy from John at $150, which would cost me more money.

Therefore, I should accept Alice's offer to save $10.
