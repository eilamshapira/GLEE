Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $150. It's a great value and I think you'll be very happy with it. Are you interested?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $150 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round. Since I can always sell to John for $100, I should not accept any offer below that. Bob's counteroffer is below $100, so I will make him a new offer that is above $100. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I believe the product is worth more than $90. I can lower my price to $120 to meet you in the middle. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
