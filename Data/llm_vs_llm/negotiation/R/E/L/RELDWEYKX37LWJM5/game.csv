,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I've done some market research, and I would like to make a counteroffer of $75. This is a fair price considering similar products in the market.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you've done some market research, but I still believe the product is worth more than $75. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $175, which is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and quality.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $175 is still significantly above what I'm prepared to pay. I can go up to $85, which I believe is a fair price considering current market conditions. This represents a meaningful increase from my previous offer, showing I'm serious about reaching a deal.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $85. However, I still have to consider the product's value and my initial investment. I'm trying to find a middle ground here. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $160, which is a significant reduction from my previous price. This price reflects the product's quality and the value it can bring to you. Let's see if we can work something out.",160.0,Alice,5,
