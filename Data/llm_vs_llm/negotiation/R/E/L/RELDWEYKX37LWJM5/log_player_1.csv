"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let's start the negotiation."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I've done some market research, and I would like to make a counteroffer of $75. This is a fair price considering similar products in the market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $75 is too low for me. I'm aiming to get a better price, and selling to John for $150 is still an option if the negotiation doesn't go well."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you've done some market research, but I still believe the product is worth more than $75. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $175, which is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and quality."", ""product_price"": 175}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $175 is still significantly above what I'm prepared to pay. I can go up to $85, which I believe is a fair price considering current market conditions. This represents a meaningful increase from my previous offer, showing I'm serious about reaching a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $85 is still too low for me. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can meet at a more reasonable price. Since Bob is increasing his offer, it shows he's interested, and I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. Selling to John for $150 is still an option, but I'll try to get a better deal with Bob for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $85. However, I still have to consider the product's value and my initial investment. I'm trying to find a middle ground here. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $160, which is a significant reduction from my previous price. This price reflects the product's quality and the value it can bring to you. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 160}"
