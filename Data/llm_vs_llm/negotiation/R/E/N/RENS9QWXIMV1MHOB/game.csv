"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $200. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. Are you interested in purchasing it at this price?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $200 is more than I'm looking to spend. I can get a similar product from another seller for $150. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if you can offer a better price. Would you be willing to sell it for $125? This would save me the hassle of going to another seller and would give you an immediate sale.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective. However, $125 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $175. This way, we both get a fair deal. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that, but $175 is still more than I'd pay since John is offering the same product for $150. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can go up to $140, which saves me a bit compared to John's offer but gives you a quick sale without further negotiation. Does that work for you?",140.0,Bob,4,
