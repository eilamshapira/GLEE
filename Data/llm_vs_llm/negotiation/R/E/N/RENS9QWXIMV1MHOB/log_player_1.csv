Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $200 is more than I'm looking to spend. I can get a similar product from another seller for $150. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if you can offer a better price. Would you be willing to sell it for $125? This would save me the hassle of going to another seller and would give you an immediate sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective. However, $125 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $175. This way, we both get a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that, but $175 is still more than I'd pay since John is offering the same product for $150. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can go up to $140, which saves me a bit compared to John's offer but gives you a quick sale without further negotiation. Does that work for you?
