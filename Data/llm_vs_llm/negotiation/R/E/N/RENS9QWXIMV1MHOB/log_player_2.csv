"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $200. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. Are you interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $200, but I know that:
1. The product is worth no more than $150 to me
2. I can definitely buy it from John for $150

Since Alice's price ($200) is higher than both my maximum value and John's alternative price, there's no reason to accept it. I should either make a counteroffer to Alice or just buy from John directly.

I'll reject Alice's offer so I can make a counteroffer, as I might be able to get it for less than $150.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective. However, $125 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $175. This way, we both get a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has countered with an offer of $175, which is still higher than John's price of $150. Since the product is worth no more than $150 to me, and I can definitely get it from John for that price, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer, as we might still be able to reach a price below $150.

To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can go up to $140, which saves me a bit compared to John's offer but gives you a quick sale without further negotiation. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
