Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer you $120 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $120 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($100), but lower than my initial offer ($140), I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. This gives me a chance to try to get a better price from Bob.

My counteroffer will be $130, which is lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and compromise, but I'm still aiming to get a good price for the product.

So, my decision is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my counteroffer is $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $120. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $130 for the product. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let me know if this price works for you!"", ""product_price"": 130}"
