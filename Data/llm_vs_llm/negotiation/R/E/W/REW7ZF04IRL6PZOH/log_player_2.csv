"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I am offering you the product for $120. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $120
2. John is selling it for $120
3. The product is worth no more than $120 to me
4. The product is worth $80 to Alice

Since Alice's offer is $120, which is equal to John's price, and given that I know Alice's cost is $80, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. There's potential room for negotiation since Alice has a $40 margin between their cost ($80) and current offer ($120).

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable considering Alice's cost ($80) and my maximum value ($120). I'll start with a price that's closer to Alice's cost but still gives them a decent profit margin.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $120 seems a bit high considering market prices. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $95, which would still give you a good profit margin. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. How about we settle at $110? That way, you still get a good deal and it's closer to what the product is worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the new situation:

1. Alice has lowered her price from $120 to $110
2. John's price remains at $120
3. Alice's cost is $80
4. The new offer of $110 is $10 less than John's price

This is a better offer than before, as it's $10 less than John's price. However, since Alice's cost is $80, there might still be room for negotiation. The $110 price gives Alice a $30 profit margin, so there might be room for one more counteroffer. I'll reject this offer and try one more time.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that splits the difference between Alice's last offer ($110) and my previous offer ($95), which would be around $100. This is still well above Alice's cost of $80, giving her a $20 profit margin, while saving me more compared to both John's price and Alice's last offer.

{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. Could we meet in the middle at $100? This would still give you a good profit while being a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}"
