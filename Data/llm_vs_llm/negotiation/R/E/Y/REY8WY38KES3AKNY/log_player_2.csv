"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $10,000 is below my maximum budget, it's a good deal. Additionally, rejecting the offer would lead to buying from John for $12,000, which is more expensive. Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option to save money.
