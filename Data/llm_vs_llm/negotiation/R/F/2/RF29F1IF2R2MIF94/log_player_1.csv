Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a reasonable price to offer to Bob. I know the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price if Bob refuses.

Since I have no information about Bob's maximum willingness to pay, I'll need to offer a price that balances the risk of rejection with the potential for higher profit. Setting the price too high could lead to rejection, but I already have a safety net of $12,000 from John.

I'll offer a moderately higher price than my minimum acceptable value:

{""product_price"": 15000}"
