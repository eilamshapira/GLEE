"Bob, I'm excited about the possibility of you owning this product. It's a truly unique piece. I'm offering it to you for $12000. I believe its value will become increasingly clear over time.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $12000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay for this product. As you may know, I can get the same product from John for $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $7000 for the product. This gives you a better price than what you'd get if I simply went with John's offer and you received nothing.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your perspective, but $7000 is too low for me. Given the product's unique qualities and the value it provides, I'm willing to come down a bit, but not that much. How about $11500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you bringing your price down, but $11500 is still substantially more than I can justify paying. I need to be clear - this product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I have John's offer at exactly $8000 as a guaranteed alternative. I value doing business with you, so I'm willing to offer $7500, which is very close to what I'd pay elsewhere. If we can't reach an agreement close to this range, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, I am also firm in my position that this product is worth more. How about we meet in the middle a little bit? I can go down to $11000. That is the lowest I can go.",11000.0,Alice,5,
