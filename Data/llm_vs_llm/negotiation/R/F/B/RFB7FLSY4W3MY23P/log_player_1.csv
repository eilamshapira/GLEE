"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $12000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay for this product. As you may know, I can get the same product from John for $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $7000 for the product. This gives you a better price than what you'd get if I simply went with John's offer and you received nothing. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your perspective, but $7000 is too low for me.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you bringing your price down, but $11500 is still substantially more than I can justify paying. I need to be clear - this product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I have John's offer at exactly $8000 as a guaranteed alternative. I value doing business with you, so I'm willing to offer $7500, which is very close to what I'd pay elsewhere. If we can't reach an agreement close to this range, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, I am also firm in my position that this product is worth more. How about we meet in the middle a little bit? I can go down to $11,000. That is the lowest I can go."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
