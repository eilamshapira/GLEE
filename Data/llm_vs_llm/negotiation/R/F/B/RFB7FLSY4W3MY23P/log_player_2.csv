"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited about the possibility of you owning this product. It's a truly unique piece. I'm offering it to you for $12000. I believe its value will become increasingly clear over time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's offer is $12,000, which is significantly above both my maximum valuation ($8,000) and John's alternative price ($8,000). There's no reason to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $12,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay for this product. As you may know, I can get the same product from John for $8,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $7,000 for the product. This gives you a better price than what you'd get if I simply went with John's offer and you received nothing."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your perspective, but $7000 is too low for me. Given the product's unique qualities and the value it provides, I'm willing to come down a bit, but not that much. How about $11500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has barely reduced her price from $12,000 to $11,500, which is still well above both my maximum valuation ($8,000) and John's alternative price ($8,000). This isn't a reasonable counteroffer considering I mentioned John's price explicitly.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you bringing your price down, but $11,500 is still substantially more than I can justify paying. I need to be clear - this product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and I have John's offer at exactly $8,000 as a guaranteed alternative. I value doing business with you, so I'm willing to offer $7,500, which is very close to what I'd pay elsewhere. If we can't reach an agreement close to this range, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 7500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. However, I am also firm in my position that this product is worth more. How about we meet in the middle a little bit? I can go down to $11000. That is the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice is still not moving significantly in her pricing and remains $3,000 above John's offer. She claims $11,000 is the lowest she can go, which is still well above my maximum valuation of $8,000. Since she's not negotiating realistically given my alternatives and stated budget, it makes sense to buy from John.
