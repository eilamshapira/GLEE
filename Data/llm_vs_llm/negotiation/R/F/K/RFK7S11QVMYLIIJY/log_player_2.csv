"Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","The offer of $175 from Alice is much higher than the maximum value I'm willing to pay ($80) and also higher than the alternative offer from John ($80).

Since the product is only worth up to $80 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $80, there's no reason to accept Alice's much higher price of $175.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $170 is still significantly higher than the maximum value I'm willing to pay ($80) and higher than John's offer of $80.

Since I can buy the same product from John for $80, which is exactly my maximum budget for this item, there's no reason to accept Alice's price of $170.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's offer of $165 is still well above my maximum value for the product ($80) and higher than John's alternative offer of $80.

Given that I can purchase the product from John for $80, which is exactly my maximum budget, there's no reason to accept Alice's significantly higher price.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's offer of $160 is still double my most recent counteroffer and significantly higher than both my maximum value for the product ($80) and John's offer ($80).

Since I can buy the same product from John for $80, which matches my maximum budget, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice when her offers remain so far above my target price.
