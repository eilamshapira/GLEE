"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The logical choice is to buy from John because:
1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me
2. Alice's offer ($12,000) is significantly higher than my maximum value
3. John's fixed price ($8,000) matches my maximum value
4. Buying from John will save me $4,000 compared to Alice's offer"
