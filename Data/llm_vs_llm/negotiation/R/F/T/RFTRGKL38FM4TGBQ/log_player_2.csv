"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $160. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $120 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering the product for $160
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $120

The decision is clear because:
- Alice's offer ($160) is above my maximum value ($120)
- John's price ($120) matches my maximum value
- Buying from Alice would mean losing $40 compared to buying from John
- John's price is the better option that matches my value threshold
