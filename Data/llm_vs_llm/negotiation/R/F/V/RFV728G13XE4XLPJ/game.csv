"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200. Let me know if you'd like to take it at this price!",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",120.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $120 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $180. Let me know if this works for you.",180.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 might still be a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $160? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $160 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I can offer $140 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",140.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $150 for the product. Let me know if this price works for you.",150.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer. How about we settle at $150? This is the lowest I can go while still feeling it's a fair deal for both of us.",150.0,Alice,5,
