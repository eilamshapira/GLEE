"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, the price of $900000 is below our minimum threshold. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1150000. This price reflects the high value of the product and is a significant reduction from our initial offer. Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to lower our offer further to $1000000. This is a substantial discount and reflects our desire to reach an agreement with you. Please consider this offer carefully.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, I still think we can find a better middle ground. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $920000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping we can move forward with this price.",920000.0,Bob,4,
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm prepared to offer it to you for $950000, which is a fair compromise and still represents a significant investment in your future. Let's see if we can finalize this deal at this price.",950000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the continued effort to find a mutually beneficial price. Your offer of $940000 is close, but I'm still a bit short of being comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you almost halfway between my last offer and yours, at $930000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",930000.0,Bob,6,
"Bob, I'm pleased to accept your offer of $930000. This price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident that the product will bring significant value to you. Let's finalize the deal at this price.",,Alice,6,AcceptOffer
