Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to offer a price that maximizes my profit while still being acceptable to Bob. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, he should theoretically be willing to pay up to that amount. However, if I price it too high, he might reject the offer.

I want to capture a significant portion of the value difference between my minimum ($8,000) and Bob's maximum ($15,000), while still giving Bob some incentive to accept.
