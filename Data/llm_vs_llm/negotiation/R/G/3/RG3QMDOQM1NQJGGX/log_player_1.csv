"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, I'm ready. Based on my understanding, I need to aim for the highest possible price while keeping the negotiation going. Here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","This is a tough spot. $70 is below my minimum of $100. However, I want to keep the negotiation alive and see if I can get a better price. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, hoping to move the price up.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, I'm making a counteroffer. I'm going to aim for a price between my original offer and my minimum.

{""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","This is a tricky situation. $90 is still below my ideal price, but at this stage, I need to start thinking more seriously about securing a deal. I am also starting to worry that Bob's valuation of the product is not that high.

I have two options: reject and risk getting an even lower offer, or sell to John for $100. Given the available rounds, I think it's time to secure a profit. I will choose the safer option.
