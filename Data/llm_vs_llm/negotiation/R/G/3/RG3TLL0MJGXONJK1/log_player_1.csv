Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation and is still a good deal for Bob, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm offering a price of $900,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still a fair price for the product given its value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $700,000 is a better offer than Bob's previous one, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. Given the time and effort spent on this negotiation, and the fact that I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
