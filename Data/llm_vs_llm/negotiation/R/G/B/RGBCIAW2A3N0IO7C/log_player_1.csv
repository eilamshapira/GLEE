"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer is $100, which is exactly the same as John's guaranteed offer and my minimum value, there's no advantage in accepting Bob's offer over selling to John. However, I believe I can get a better price from Bob, so I'll reject and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still maintain a good margin.
