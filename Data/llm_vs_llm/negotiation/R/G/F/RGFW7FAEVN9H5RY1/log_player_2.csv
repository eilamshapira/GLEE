"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. It represents a significant value proposition. I'm willing to let it go to you for $1500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $1,500,000, which exceeds my budget, I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,000,000.
