Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Given that the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, and Bob's offer is significantly below that, I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000}"
