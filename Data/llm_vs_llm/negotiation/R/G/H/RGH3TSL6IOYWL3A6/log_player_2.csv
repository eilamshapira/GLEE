Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I am willing to come down a little bit more, but I need to make sure I get fair value for the product. My final offer is $11000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

At this point, it seems unlikely Alice will go below $10,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to take the guaranteed deal from John."
