"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a great asset for your business. My initial offer is $1800000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1800000 is significantly above my budget. I have other options available at much lower prices. I value this product and would like to work with you, but I need a more reasonable price. Would you consider $700000 for the product?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $700000 is significantly below the value I place on this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1400000.  This price reflects the unique benefits and potential of this product.  Let's find a mutually beneficial solution.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $1400000 is still well above what I can justify for this product. I have a firm alternative offer at $800000 from another seller. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I can offer $750000, which is more than my alternative option. This would be a fair price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $750000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the value I place on this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to offer it for $1000000.  This price reflects the unique value proposition of this product and the potential for a successful partnership. Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
