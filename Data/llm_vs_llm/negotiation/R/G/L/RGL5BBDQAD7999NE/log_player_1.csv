Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1800000 is significantly above my budget. I have other options available at much lower prices. I value this product and would like to work with you, but I need a more reasonable price. Would you consider $700000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $1400000 is still well above what I can justify for this product. I have a firm alternative offer at $800000 from another seller. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I can offer $750000, which is more than my alternative option. This would be a fair price that works for both of us.
