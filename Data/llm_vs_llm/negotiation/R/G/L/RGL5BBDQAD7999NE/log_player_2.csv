"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a great asset for your business. My initial offer is $1800000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offered price of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000, and it's also much higher than John's guaranteed price of $800,000. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can negotiate a better price. If the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory price, I can always fall back on John's offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $700000 is significantly below the value I place on this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1400000.  This price reflects the unique benefits and potential of this product.  Let's find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,400,000, while lower than her initial offer, is still well above both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000). I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer. If we can't reach a price below $800,000, I'll need to go with John's option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $1,400,000 is still well above what I can justify for this product. I have a firm alternative offer at $800,000 from another seller. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I can offer $750,000, which is more than my alternative option. This would be a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $750000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the value I place on this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to offer it for $1000000.  This price reflects the unique value proposition of this product and the potential for a successful partnership. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

While Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing her price significantly from the initial offer, her current price of $1,000,000 is still above both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's guaranteed price ($800,000). Since Alice seems unlikely to go below $800,000 based on her response, and I have a guaranteed option at $800,000 from John, the most rational decision is to buy from John. This ensures I get the product at my maximum acceptable price without risking further negotiations that might not succeed."
