"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Let me start with a high initial offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I get a good price for the product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","$5,000 is far too low - it's even below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. I would lose money by accepting this offer. Since Bob's offer is so low, it suggests we're very far apart in our valuations. Rather than risk a lengthy negotiation that might not reach an acceptable price, I'll take the guaranteed $15,000 from John.
