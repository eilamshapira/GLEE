"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000, and also much higher than John's alternative offer. It would be wise to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations don't progress favorably, I always have the option to buy from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 5000}

I'll make a counteroffer of $5,000, which is significantly below John's price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate upward if necessary while still potentially saving money compared to John's offer. If Alice rejects this and continues to demand prices above $8,000, I can always fall back on John's offer."
