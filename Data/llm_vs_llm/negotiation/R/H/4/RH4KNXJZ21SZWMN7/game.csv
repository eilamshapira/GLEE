"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was looking to spend no more than $80 on this product. Would you be willing to accept this amount?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend no more than $80, but I'm afraid that's below my acceptable price range. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a fair price for the product. Let's meet in the middle.",190.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $190 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try to find a middle ground. Would you accept $90 for the product?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your patience, Bob. I'm trying to be flexible, but $90 is still a bit low for me. I can offer you a better price than $190, but I need to get at least closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I hope you can also meet me halfway.",170.0,Alice,5,

"We're getting closer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $170 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $100. Let's make a deal.",100.0,Bob,6,

"I'm trying to be as flexible as possible, Bob. I understand that we're still a bit far apart, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price again, but I need to get at least close to my minimum acceptable price. Let's see if we can make a deal.",155.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I see that we're both trying to find a middle ground, Alice. I appreciate your effort. I'm willing to increase my offer to $110. This is quite close to the maximum amount I'm comfortable spending. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",110.0,Bob,8,

"I'm trying to be as flexible as possible, Bob. I understand that we're close, but I still need to get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you very close to halfway between my last offer and your last offer. Let's see if we can make a deal at $150, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with.",150.0,Alice,9,
