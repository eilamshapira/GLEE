"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm ready to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9500 is the lowest I can go.  Let me know if that works for you.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9000. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know if this works for you.",9000.0,Bob,4,
