Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm ready to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I think I can get a bit closer to my goal of $12,000.  I'm going to counteroffer."
