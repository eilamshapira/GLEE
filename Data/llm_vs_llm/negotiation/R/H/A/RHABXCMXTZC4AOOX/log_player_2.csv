"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a product that I believe would be valuable to you. Based on my assessment, this product is worth $150 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140, which gives you a $10 surplus while allowing me to make a better profit than my alternative option. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
