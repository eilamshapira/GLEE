"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $14500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth.",14500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe $14500 is quite high for this product. Given the current market conditions and similar products available, I would be willing to pay $12800. This would still provide you with a reasonable profit margin while being more affordable for me.",12800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, $12800 is still too low considering the product's quality and market value. I can reduce my initial price to $13800, which represents a significant discount from my original offer and provides good value for both of us.",13800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price. Your product is valuable, but I still feel $13800 is on the high side. I can increase my offer to $13200, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a fair value for this product. This price would work well for both of us.",13200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $13200. We're getting closer to an agreement, but I still need a bit more. I can come down to $13500, which is a fair compromise between our positions. This price reflects the true value of the product while giving you a good deal compared to market rates.",13500.0,Alice,5,
