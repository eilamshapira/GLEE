"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $14,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe $14500 is quite high for this product. Given the current market conditions and similar products available, I would be willing to pay $12800. This would still provide you with a reasonable profit margin while being more affordable for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $12,800 is too low considering the product's value, and I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a better price. Since Bob has moved from my initial offer, I'll also show some flexibility in my next offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, $12,800 is still too low considering the product's quality and market value. I can reduce my initial price to $13,800, which represents a significant discount from my original offer and provides good value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13800}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price. Your product is valuable, but I still feel $13800 is on the high side. I can increase my offer to $13200, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a fair value for this product. This price would work well for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make another counteroffer. Bob has shown willingness to negotiate by increasing his offer, and we're getting closer to finding a middle ground. The current offer of $13,200 is better but still leaves room for negotiation, and it's significantly better than John's $12,000 offer, so I can safely continue negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $13,200. We're getting closer to an agreement, but I still need a bit more. I can come down to $13,500, which is a fair compromise between our positions. This price reflects the true value of the product while giving you a good deal compared to market rates."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
