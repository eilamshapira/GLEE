Round 2

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12000, which is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
