"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given the information:
- The product is worth no more than $120 to me (Bob)
- Alice is offering the product for $100
- John is willing to sell the product for $120

Alice's offer is $20 cheaper than John's price. Since the product is worth up to $120 to me, and Alice's price is below that threshold, it makes economic sense to accept Alice's offer and save $20.
