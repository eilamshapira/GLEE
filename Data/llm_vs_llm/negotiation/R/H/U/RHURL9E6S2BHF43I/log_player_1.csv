Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my strategy carefully. If I offer the product to Bob for anything less than $12,000, I would be making less money than I could get from John. Since the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, he won't pay more than that amount.

Given that I can sell the product to John for $12,000, and that's also my minimum value for the product, I should offer Bob a price that would give me at least $12,000.
