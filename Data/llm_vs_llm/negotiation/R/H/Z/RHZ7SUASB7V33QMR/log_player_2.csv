"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value ($1,500,000) and also higher than John's price ($1,500,000). It would be better to reject this offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal from Alice. If negotiations don't work out, I can always buy from John at $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'll offer $1,200,000, which is significantly lower than both John's price and Alice's cost. This gives room for negotiation while potentially saving money compared to John's price of $1,500,000. If Alice rejects this offer, we can still negotiate upward, or I ultimately have the option to buy from John at $1,500,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's new offer ($1,800,000) is still higher than John's price ($1,500,000), and Alice seems reluctant to come down to a more reasonable price, it makes the most sense to buy from John. John's price equals my maximum value for the product, and continuing negotiations with Alice might not lead to a better deal. Better to secure the product at $1,500,000 from John than risk further unsuccessful negotiations with Alice."
