"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer at $150
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John at $120

Since:
- The product is worth no more than $120 to me
- Alice's price ($150) is higher than my maximum value ($120)
- John's guaranteed price ($120) matches my maximum value
- My goal is to buy the product while saving money

The logical choice is to buy from John at $120. While this is still at my maximum value, it's $30 less than Alice's offer and within my acceptable price range.
