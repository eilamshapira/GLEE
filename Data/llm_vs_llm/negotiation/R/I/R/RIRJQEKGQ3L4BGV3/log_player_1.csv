Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since the product is worth no less than $120 to me, and Bob's offer is exactly $120, I don't want to accept it immediately, as I want to try to earn more. However, I also don't want to sell it to John for the same price without trying to negotiate further with Bob. 

So, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $120, which is the minimum value of the product to me, I'll try to negotiate a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my initial offer, to show that I'm willing to compromise.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer of $130 is higher than my minimum value of $120, and it's also higher than John's offer. Since I still have 6 rounds left to negotiate, I'll try to see if I can get an even better deal from Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $130, I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my previous counteroffer of $180. I'll make a counteroffer of $155, which is still higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my previous counteroffer.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer of $140 is getting closer to what I'm looking for, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since I have 4 rounds left to negotiate, I'll try to make another counteroffer to see if I can get Bob to increase his price further.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $140, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than the midpoint between his offer and my previous counteroffer of $155. I'll make a counteroffer of $147.50, but to make it a simpler negotiation, I'll round it to $148, and then further to $150, to make a clearer and more reasonable offer, and to avoid very small increments.
