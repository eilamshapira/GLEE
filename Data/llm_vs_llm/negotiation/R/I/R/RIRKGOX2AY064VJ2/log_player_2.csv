"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to consider my options carefully. 

Alice is offering the product for $100, which is $50 less than what John is offering ($150). 

Since the product is worth no more than $150 to me, and my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, accepting Alice's offer at $100 would be the rational choice.
