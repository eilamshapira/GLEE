Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I should buy some product but save as much money as I can. The product's value to me is no more than $15,000. Alice offers the product for $12,000. I should accept the offer because it is cheaper than buying from John.
