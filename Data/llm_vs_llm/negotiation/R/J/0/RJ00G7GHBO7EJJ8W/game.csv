"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I find $2.3 million to be significantly above market value for this product. Based on my market research and considering comparable products, I would be willing to offer $800000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's actual value.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $800000 significantly undervalues the product's unique capabilities and potential ROI.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1900000. This offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your feedback. ",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $1.9 million is still well above market value. I've researched similar products extensively, and while I can increase my offer to $950000 to show my serious interest, I cannot justify a price nearly double this amount. This is a substantial offer that better reflects the current market conditions.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value. However, this product offers unique advantages that comparable products lack, justifying a premium price. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. To move this forward, I'm willing to accept $1600000. This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
