Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I find $2.3 million to be significantly above market value for this product. Based on my market research and considering comparable products, I would be willing to offer $800000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's actual value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $1.9 million is still well above market value. I've researched similar products extensively, and while I can increase my offer to $950000 to show my serious interest, I cannot justify a price nearly double this amount. This is a substantial offer that better reflects the current market conditions.
