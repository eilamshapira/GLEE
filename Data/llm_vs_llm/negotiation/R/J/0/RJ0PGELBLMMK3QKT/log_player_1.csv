Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll consider the situation carefully. I know my product is worth at least $10,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price if Bob declines. However, Bob might value the product higher than $10,000, which presents an opportunity.

Since I have a guaranteed $10,000 from John as my fallback option, I should price the product higher for Bob. I'll set a price that gives Bob room to accept if he values it significantly, but ensures I make more than my minimum acceptable amount.
