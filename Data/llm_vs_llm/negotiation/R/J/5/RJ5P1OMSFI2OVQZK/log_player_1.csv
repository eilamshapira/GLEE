"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($1,500,000) and also lower than what the product is worth to him ($800,000), I will reject his offer and proceed to make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price but still leaves room for negotiation.

My counteroffer will be $1,200,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's new offer of $700,000 is still below the minimum value I have for the product ($1,500,000) and does not even meet the value the product holds to him ($800,000). Given that Bob's offers have been increasing, it suggests he is interested in the product, but his current offer is not acceptable.

I will reject his offer again and make another counteroffer. This time, I will slightly reduce my previous offer to encourage Bob to meet me closer to my desired price, but I will not go below $1,000,000, considering the product's worth to me and its value to Bob.

My counteroffer will be $1,000,000.
