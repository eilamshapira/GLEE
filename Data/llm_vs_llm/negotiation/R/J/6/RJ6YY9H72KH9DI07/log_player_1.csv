Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $14,500. It's a great value and I think you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

# Explanation:
1. **Accepting Bob's Offer**: If I accept Bob's offer of $12,000, I will make a profit of $2,000 above my minimum value of $10,000. However, this is significantly below Bob's actual valuation of $15,000, so there's room for negotiation.
2. **Rejecting Bob's Offer**: By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that is closer to his valuation but still profitable for me. This strategy allows me to potentially earn more than $12,000.
3. **Selling to John**: Selling to John for $10,000 is my fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail, but it's the least profitable outcome.

Given these considerations, rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to maximize my profit.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. Would you consider $13,500 instead? I think it's a fair price given the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, after considering your offer, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $13,000? This is a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I could do $12500. That's a fair price for both of us, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

# Explanation:
1. **Accepting Bob's Offer**: Bob's offer of $12,500 is reasonably close to his actual valuation of $15,000. This gives me a decent profit of $2,500.
2. **Rejecting Bob's Offer**: While I could potentially push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away from the deal if I insist on a higher price.
3. **Selling to John**: Selling to John for $10,000 is still my fallback option, but accepting Bob's offer of $12,500 is clearly a better deal.

Given these points, accepting Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good outcome that provides a substantial profit while minimizing the risk of the deal falling through.
