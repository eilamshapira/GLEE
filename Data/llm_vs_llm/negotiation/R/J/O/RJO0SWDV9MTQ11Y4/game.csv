"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you coming back to me. However, I can't go as low as $8000. Considering the value and the benefits this product offers, and knowing your interest, I'm willing to meet you closer to my initial asking price. How about $16000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $16000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $9000. This is the best I can do at the moment. Let me know if this works for you.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible. While $9000 is too low, I am willing to come down from my last offer. Let's meet in the middle, how about $14000? This is really the lowest I can go while still ensuring the product's value is properly respected.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14000 is still beyond what I'm prepared to spend. I can go up to $9500. This is my final offer before I consider other options. Let me know if this works for you.",9500.0,Bob,6,
