"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate it, I think $14000 is a bit high. Given market conditions, I'd be willing to pay $12800 for the product. This still gives you a good profit margin while being more favorable to me. What do you think?",12800.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the market, but the product's value to me is quite high.  Could we perhaps meet in the middle at $13400?",13400.0,Alice,3,
