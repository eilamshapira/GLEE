Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate it, I think $14000 is a bit high. Given market conditions, I'd be willing to pay $12800 for the product. This still gives you a good profit margin while being more favorable to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
