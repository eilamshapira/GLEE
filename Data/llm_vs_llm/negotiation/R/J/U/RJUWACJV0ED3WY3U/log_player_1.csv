Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $12,000, and the option to sell to John for $15,000, I will:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Considering the options:

*   **Accept Bob's offer ($14,000):** This is better than my minimum of $15,000.
*   **Reject Bob's offer and counteroffer:** This might lead to a lower price or Bob walking away.
*   **Sell to John ($15,000):** This is better than $14,000, but I can push for a higher price with Bob.

I will continue to negotiate with Bob.
