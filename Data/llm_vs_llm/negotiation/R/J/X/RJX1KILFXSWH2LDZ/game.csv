"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I notice your price is the same as what I can get from another seller. To make this deal work for me, I'd need a better price. Based on my research and budget, I'd like to offer $8500 for the product. This would make it worthwhile for me to purchase from you rather than my alternative option.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest and I understand your budget concerns, Bob. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell the product for $10500. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. Your offer of $10500 is better than my alternative, but I'm still looking to get the best value possible. Could we meet closer to my initial offer? I'm willing to pay $9200 for the product. This would make it a great deal for me while still being fair to you.",9200.0,Bob,4,

"Thanks for your response, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about this: I'll sell you the product for $10000. I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving to $10000 - we're getting closer! I'm definitely interested in closing this deal with you rather than going elsewhere. To make this work for my budget, I'd like to counter with $9500. This seems like a fair middle ground between our positions and would make it a win-win for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Thanks for coming down to $9800, Alice. We're getting very close now. I think we can find a price that makes us both happy. I'm prepared to pay $9650 for the product. This is very close to your last offer, and it would allow me to stay within my budget while still giving you a fair price. Does that work for you?",9650.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your continued negotiation, Bob! I appreciate your offer of $9650. To make this work, how about we settle at $9750? Itâ€™s a compromise that gets us both closer to our goals. Let me know what you think!",9750.0,Alice,9,
