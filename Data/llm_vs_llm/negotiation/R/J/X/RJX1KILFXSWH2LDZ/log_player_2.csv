"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you a premium product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $12000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and John is also selling it for $12,000. Alice has offered it for $12,000 as well, which means I wouldn't save any money by accepting her offer compared to buying from John.

Since the goal is to save money, and Alice's initial offer doesn't provide any savings, I should try to negotiate a better price with Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I notice your price is the same as what I can get from another seller. To make this deal work for me, I'd need a better price. Based on my research and budget, I'd like to offer $8,500 for the product. This would make it worthwhile for me to purchase from you rather than my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 8500}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest and I understand your budget concerns, Bob. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell the product for $10500. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!

Your offer of $10,500 is better than my alternative, but I'm still looking to get the best value possible. Could we meet closer to my initial offer? I'm willing to pay $9,200 for the product. This would make it a great deal for me while still being fair to you."", ""product_price"": 9200}"

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving to $10,000 - we're getting closer! I'm definitely interested in closing this deal with you rather than going elsewhere. To make this work for my budget, I'd like to counter with $9,500.

Round 9
Alice's offer:

We're down to the last couple of rounds, and the difference between our positions is quite small now. This is a good deal that saves me a significant amount of money.
