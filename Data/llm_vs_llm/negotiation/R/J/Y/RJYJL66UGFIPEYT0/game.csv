"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is unique, the price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $500000 for it.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $500000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise and lower the price to $1800000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further negotiations.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but we're still quite far apart. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but $1800000 is not feasible for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $600000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still believe the product's value is not reflected in your offer. I'm willing to make another concession and lower the price to $1600000. I think this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's uniqueness and value.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see we're making progress, but the gap is still significant. To be completely transparent, I have a budget I need to stick to. I can go up to $700000 for this product.  If this doesn't work, I might have to explore other options, even though I'd prefer to work with you.",700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your transparency about your budget. I appreciate your honesty. Considering your constraints, I'm willing to make a more significant concession. I'll lower the price to $1200000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm still open to negotiations, but I hope we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the significant reduction. It seems like we both want to find a solution. However, the price is still a bit beyond my reach. I'm willing to offer $750000. This is my final offer, as I'm pushing my budget to the limit. I hope this works for you, as I believe it's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your final offer, and I understand that you've stretched your budget to make it work. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than $750000. Considering we're close to the end of our negotiations, I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll meet you halfway between your offer and John's offer, which I have as an alternative. I'll lower the price to $875000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",875000.0,Alice,9,
