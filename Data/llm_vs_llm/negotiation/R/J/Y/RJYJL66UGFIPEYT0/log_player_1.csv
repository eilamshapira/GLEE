"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is unique, the price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $500000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than my initial price and even lower than what John is willing to pay, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $500,000 is a bit too low for me.

I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but we're still quite far apart. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but $1800000 is not feasible for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $600000. I believe this is a fair compromise.

You have three options:

Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is still significantly lower than my previous counteroffer and even lower than what John is willing to pay, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer. I want to try to get a better price from Bob before considering selling to John."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're making progress, but the gap is still significant. To be completely transparent, I have a budget I need to stick to. I can go up to $700000 for this product.  If this doesn't work, I might have to explore other options, even though I'd prefer to work with you.

Since Bob's offer of $700,000 is still lower than what John is willing to pay, I will reject Bob's offer. However, I want to try to get a better price from Bob before considering selling to John. I'll make another counteroffer, but I'll also keep in mind that Bob mentioned he might have to explore other options, so I'll try to be more competitive in my next offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your transparency about your budget. I appreciate your honesty. Considering your constraints, I'm willing to make a more significant concession. I'll lower the price to $1,200,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the significant reduction. It seems like we both want to find a solution. However, the price is still a bit beyond my reach. I'm willing to offer $750000. This is my final offer, as I'm pushing my budget to the limit. I hope this works for you, as I believe it's a fair compromise.

Since Bob's offer of $750,000 is still lower than what John is willing to pay, and Bob mentioned it's his final offer, I will reject Bob's offer. I don't think making another counteroffer would be productive, given that Bob has already stretched his budget. Instead, I'll consider selling the product to John for $1,000,000, which is a better option for me. 

However, I will not sell to John just yet. I will make one more offer to Bob in the next round to see if he changes his mind, but I'm prepared to sell to John if Bob doesn't budge."

I'll meet you halfway between your offer and John's offer, which I have as an alternative. I'll lower the price to $875,000.
