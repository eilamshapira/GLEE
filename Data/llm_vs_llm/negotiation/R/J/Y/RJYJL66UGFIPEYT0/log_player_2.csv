Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the significant reduction. It seems like we both want to find a solution. However, the price is still a bit beyond my reach.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your final offer, and I understand that you've stretched your budget to make it work. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than $750000. Considering we're close to the end of our negotiations, I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll meet you halfway between your offer and John's offer, which I have as an alternative. I'll lower the price to $875000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

Alice is clearly aware of your backup plan and is trying to squeeze out as much as possible. It's unlikely she'll go below John's price at this point.  Buying from John guarantees you the product at your target price."
