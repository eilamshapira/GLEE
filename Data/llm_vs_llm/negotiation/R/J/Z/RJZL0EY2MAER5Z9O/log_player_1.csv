"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm starting with a competitive price, considering the product's worth to me."", ""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but based on my evaluation, I believe a fair price for the product is considerably lower. I'm prepared to buy it for $500000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $500,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me, and I believe I can get a better deal. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is still an option, but I'd like to explore the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that we have different evaluations of the product's value. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. Considering your offer, I'm reducing my initial price, but I still believe the product is worth more than your proposed amount. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
