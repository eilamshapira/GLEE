"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given the information provided, let me analyze my options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: Pay $115 for the product
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John for $100

Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and John is offering it at exactly $100, Alice's price of $115 is higher than both my valuation and my alternative option. The rational choice is to buy from John to save money.
