"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, Bob! I'm thrilled to be talking with you about this incredible opportunity. I believe this product aligns perfectly with your needs, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.

I'm willing to offer it to you for:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm confident this product is the perfect fit for you. I'm offering it at a price that reflects its true value."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I believe $1200000 is still a bit high. Given current market conditions, I would be comfortable with a price of $900000, which I believe is fair for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","This is a tough spot. Bob's offer is below my minimum, but I also don't want to lose out on a sale altogether. I need to consider my options carefully.

I still believe the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me. Selling to John is tempting, but I want to see if I can get a higher price.

I'll make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your position on the market conditions, but I have to stand firm on the value of this product.

I'm willing to come down a bit, but I believe a price of:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it at a price I believe is still incredibly fair."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you moving in my direction, Alice. Your willingness to negotiate shows we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. I can increase my offer to $1000000, which represents a significant move toward your position. This price would allow both of us to walk away satisfied with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","This is a critical moment. Bob's offer is exactly what John is offering. While I *could* sell to John right now and be guaranteed $1,000,000, I still believe the product is worth more. I've already made some concessions, and I'm running out of time. I need to make a decision.

I'm going to keep negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, Bob, I appreciate your willingness to work with me. I'm going to be honest, this product is very important to me, and I see its value as being higher than $1,000,000.

Therefore, I'm willing to meet you at:

{""message"": ""Bob, I know we are getting closer to a deal. I am offering you a price that I believe is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
