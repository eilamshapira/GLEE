"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is the perfect fit for you. I'm offering it at a price that reflects its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $1,500,000
2. Alice's offer is $1,200,000, which is $300,000 less than my maximum value
3. John's fixed price is $1,500,000
4. I have 10 rounds to negotiate

Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is already significantly below my maximum value, but since this is just the first round, I might be able to negotiate an even better price. Given that I have plenty of rounds left and there's potential to save even more money, I should try to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice opened with $1,200,000, I'll start significantly lower to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to appear unreasonable.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I believe $1,200,000 is still a bit high. Given current market conditions, I would be comfortable with a price of $900,000, which I believe is fair for both parties."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it at a price I believe is still incredibly fair. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's initial offer was $1,200,000
2. I countered with $900,000
3. Alice has now come down to $1,100,000, showing willingness to negotiate
4. This is $400,000 less than John's price
5. We still have several rounds left for negotiation

Alice has moved $100,000 in my direction, which is a positive sign. However, she moved substantially less than I did in my counteroffer. Since we still have many rounds left and Alice has shown willingness to reduce the price, I should continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has moved down $100,000, so I should also show some flexibility by moving up from my previous offer, but still try to meet at a better price point.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you moving in my direction, Alice. Your willingness to negotiate shows we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. I can increase my offer to $1,000,000, which represents a significant move toward your position. This price would allow both of us to walk away satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I know we are getting closer to a deal. I am offering you a price that I believe is fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let's analyze the current situation:

1. The negotiation pattern so far:
   - Alice: $1,200,000
   - Me: $900,000
   - Alice: $1,100,000
   - Me: $1,000,000
   - Alice: $1,050,000

2. Alice has now met me exactly halfway between her last offer ($1,100,000) and my last offer ($1,000,000)
3. This price represents a significant saving of $450,000 compared to John's price
4. We're showing a clear convergence pattern
5. While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice might become frustrated and raise her price

Given that:
- We've reached a fair middle ground
- The savings are substantial
- The negotiation pattern suggests this might be close to Alice's bottom line
- Further negotiation might risk losing the current favorable offer
