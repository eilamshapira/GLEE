"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

{""product_price"": 19500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $11,000 is significantly below even my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Since I can sell to John for $15,000, and Bob's offer is much lower than that, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial price somewhat but still maintain a strong position, considering I have John's $15,000 offer as a backup.

{""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $12,000 is still well below John's guaranteed offer of $15,000. Since I'm not seeing significant movement toward a price that would exceed John's offer, and we've already gone through several rounds, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John rather than continue negotiating.
