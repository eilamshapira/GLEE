# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a valuable product that I believe would be of significant benefit to you. Given the market value and the unique advantages this product provides, I'm offering it to you for $12500. This represents an excellent value considering what the product can deliver for you. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,500 is less than your $15,000 maximum, it's a long way from Alice's $8,000 valuation. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal."
