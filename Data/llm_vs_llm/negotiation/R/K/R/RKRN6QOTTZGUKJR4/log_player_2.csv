"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $25000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($8,000) and John's alternative offer ($8,000). Since Alice's initial offer is more than three times what I'm willing to pay, and I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at my maximum price point, it makes the most economic sense to buy from John rather than continue negotiations with Alice."
