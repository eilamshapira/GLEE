"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1250000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. While I understand your perspective, the product's value to you is substantial, and it's worth more than comparable items due to its superior features. I'm willing to come down slightly, meeting you in the middle from my original offer, at $1625000.",1625000.0,Alice,3,
