"Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of interest to you. It's a high-quality item worth $150. I'd like to offer it to you for $140, which is a fair price considering its value.",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $140 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $100 is too low for this product. Its actual value is at least $120, which is the minimum I can accept. I can come down to $130 as my best offer, which is still a good deal considering the product's quality and value.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $130 is still above what I'm willing to spend. I can go up to $110. Let me know if you can meet me at that price.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to work with you. However, I need to be clear that my absolute minimum is $120, which is the actual value of the product to me. I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase at this price. If we can agree on $120, I'd be happy to sell it to you instead.",120.0,Alice,5,
