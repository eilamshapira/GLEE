"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Based on the information provided, let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me (Bob).
2. Alice is offering the product for $11,999.
3. I can buy the same product from John for $8,000.

Since Alice's offer ($11,999) exceeds both the product's value to me ($8,000) and John's alternative offer ($8,000), the most economical decision would be to buy from John.
