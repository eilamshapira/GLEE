"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: The offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $12,000, and it's also higher than John's alternative offer of $12,000. It would be wise to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations with Alice don't improve, I can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 10000}

Reasoning: Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice and also worth $12,000 to me, I'll start with a lower offer of $10,000. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially allowing both parties to benefit. If Alice accepts, I save $2,000 compared to John's offer. If she counters, we still have room to negotiate up to a maximum of $12,000, which is my walk-away price (as I can always buy from John at that price)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: While Alice has reduced her price from $18,000 to $15,000, this is still $3,000 above John's offer of $12,000. Since I can always buy from John at $12,000, and that price matches my maximum value for the product, there's no reason to accept a price higher than that. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, trying to find a price point that works for both parties but stays below $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 11000}

Reasoning: I'll increase my previous offer of $10,000 to $11,000 to show willingness to negotiate and move closer to a middle ground. This price point would:
1. Still save me $1,000 compared to John's offer
2. Allow Alice to make a $1,000 profit (since the product is worth $12,000 to her)
3. Show that I'm willing to be flexible while maintaining a reasonable position
4. Leave some room for further negotiation if needed

If Alice rejects this offer, I still have the option to either negotiate further or fall back on John's offer of $12,000."
