Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer that balances the potential for higher profit while considering that I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John if Bob declines.

{""product_price"": 22500}

I chose this price because:
1. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000)
2. It still leaves room for Bob to potentially see value if the product is worth more to him
3. If Bob rejects it, I still have my guaranteed $15,000 from John
4. It's not so high that it would immediately seem unreasonable"
