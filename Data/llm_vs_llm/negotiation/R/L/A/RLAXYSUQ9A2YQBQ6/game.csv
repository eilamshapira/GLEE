"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. Given market conditions, I can actually get this product elsewhere for $100. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. Would you consider selling it for $90?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I appreciate that you're trying to work with me. While $90 is a bit too low, I am willing to come down in price. How about $170?",170.0,Alice,3,
