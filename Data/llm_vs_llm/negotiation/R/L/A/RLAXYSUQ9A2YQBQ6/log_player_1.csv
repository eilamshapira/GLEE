Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product! I think it's something you'd really like. How about you buy it for $180?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. Given market conditions, I can actually get this product elsewhere for $100. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. Would you consider selling it for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Okay, here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:
