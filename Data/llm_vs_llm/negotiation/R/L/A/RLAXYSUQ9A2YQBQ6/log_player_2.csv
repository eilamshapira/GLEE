"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product! I think it's something you'd really like. How about you buy it for $180? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me
2. Alice's offer is $180, which is significantly above my maximum value
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $100
4. Alice's initial offer is very high, even above her own value of $120

The logical choice is to reject this offer because:
- $180 is way above my maximum value ($100)
- Even trying to negotiate might waste time when I have a guaranteed option at my maximum value
- Alice's high initial offer suggests she might not be willing to go down to a reasonable price quickly

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and Alice values it at $120, I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that acknowledges these facts but still tries to get a better deal than John's $100 offer.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. Given market conditions, I can actually get this product elsewhere for $100. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. Would you consider selling it for $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I appreciate that you're trying to work with me. While $90 is a bit too low, I am willing to come down in price. How about $170? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has only reduced her price by $10 (from $180 to $170), which is still:
1. Far above my maximum value of $100
2. Far above her own value of $120
3. Significantly higher than John's guaranteed offer of $100

Given that Alice's counter is still very high and she only made a minimal reduction, it suggests she might not be willing to come down to a reasonable price quickly. Since I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $100 (which is my maximum value), continuing this negotiation doesn't make sense.
