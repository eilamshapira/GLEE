"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it's a really valuable item. I'm asking $300 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","The product is worth no more than $150 to me, and Alice is asking for $300. That's way too high. I'm not going to pay that much. I'd rather buy from John for $150 than pay Alice $300.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice is clearly trying to get as much as she can for the product, but I'm not going to overpay. I'll start with a low offer to see how she reacts.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. $100 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $225? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $225. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $225

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice is still asking too much. $225 is still above my maximum value of $150. I'm not going to pay that much. I'll either need to negotiate her down further or just buy from John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, Alice is budging, but not enough. Let's try to nudge her closer to my ideal price, but still leave some room for negotiation.
