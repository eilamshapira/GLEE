Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product today. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $12,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality of the product, $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $8000, which is still a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand budget constraints, but I need to consider the true value of this product. $8,000 is actually my absolute minimum price point - it's what I could get from another interested buyer right now. Given the quality and features of this product, I could meet you in the middle at $10,000, which represents a significant $2,000 discount from my initial offer. This is a very competitive price for what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10000 is still a bit out of my range.  Given the value I place on the product and my budget, I can go up to $9000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.
