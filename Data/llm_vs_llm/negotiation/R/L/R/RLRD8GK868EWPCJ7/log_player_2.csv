Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality of the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand budget constraints, but I need to consider the true value of this product. $8000 is actually my absolute minimum price point - it's what I could get from another interested buyer right now. Given the quality and features of this product, I could meet you in the middle at $10000, which represents a significant $2000 discount from my initial offer. This is a very competitive price for what you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Given the value I place on the product and my budget, I can go up to $9,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
