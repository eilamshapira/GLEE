"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering my premium product to you for $1100000. This product is in high demand, and I know it will be a great asset to you. If you're interested, please let me know at your earliest convenience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me think through this decision:

1. The product is worth up to $1,200,000 to me (my maximum value)
2. Alice's offer is $1,100,000
3. John is willing to sell it for $1,200,000

Alice's offer saves me $100,000 compared to John's price, and it's below my maximum valuation. It makes financial sense to accept Alice's offer.
