"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm sure you'll appreciate the price of $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $1,000,000, it's a good deal.
