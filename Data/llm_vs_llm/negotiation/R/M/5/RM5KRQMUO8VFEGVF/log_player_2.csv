"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm willing to let it go for: 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering the product for $18,000
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $8,000

The logical choice is to buy from John since:
- Alice's price ($18,000) is significantly higher than my maximum value ($8,000)
- John's price ($8,000) matches my maximum value
- Buying from Alice would mean paying $10,000 more than necessary
