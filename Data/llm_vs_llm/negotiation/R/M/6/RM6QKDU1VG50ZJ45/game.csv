"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000, considering the market value and my own financial constraints.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're working with a budget. However, $8000 is lower than I can accept. Given the product's unique value and potential return on investment, would you consider $16500?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $16500 is still a bit steep for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'd like to propose $12250 as a counteroffer.",12250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle. I'm getting closer to a price I can accept. How about we try $15000? I believe that's a very fair price considering the benefits this product offers.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for continuing to negotiate with me. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, $15000 is still a bit above my budget. Considering the product's value and my limitations, I'd like to propose $10500 as a counteroffer. This is a significant increase from my previous offers, and I hope it's more in line with your expectations.",10500.0,Bob,6,
