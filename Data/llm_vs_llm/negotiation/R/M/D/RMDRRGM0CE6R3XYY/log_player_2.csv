"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have an excellent product available. I'm offering it at $120. Let me know if you'd like to buy it at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to consider the value of the product to me and the available options.

The product is worth no more than $80 to me, and Alice is offering it for $120, which exceeds my valuation.

John is offering the same product for $80, which matches my maximum valuation.

It wouldn't make financial sense to pay $120 for something I value at $80 maximum, especially when there's an alternative option at $80.
