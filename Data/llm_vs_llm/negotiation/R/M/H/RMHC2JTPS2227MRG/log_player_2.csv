"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $150, and Alice is offering the product at that price, there's no reason to reject her offer. Accepting means you get the product for the same price you'd pay to John."
