"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to make a decision based on the offer from Alice and my alternatives. 

Alice is offering the product for $9,500, which is actually $1,500 more than the product is worth to me (since it's worth no more than $8,000 to me).

I also have the option to buy from John for exactly $8,000, which matches the maximum value I place on the product.

Since Alice's offer exceeds the product's value to me, and I have a guaranteed alternative at my maximum valuation, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to evaluate this new offer from Alice. She's now offering the product for $9,200, which is still $1,200 above my maximum valuation of $8,000. 

I still have the option to buy from John for $8,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since Alice's revised offer still exceeds what the product is worth to me, and I have a guaranteed alternative at my maximum valuation, I should reject this offer and try another counteroffer.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to evaluate Alice's latest offer of $8,900. This is still $900 above my maximum valuation of $8,000 for the product.

I continue to have the option to buy from John for $8,000, which matches exactly what the product is worth to me.

Since Alice's offer remains above my maximum valuation, and I have a guaranteed alternative at exactly my maximum price point, I should reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

Round 6

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,600.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's latest offer is $8,600, which is still $600 above my maximum valuation of $8,000.

I still have the option to buy from John for $8,000, which exactly matches my maximum valuation for the product.

Since Alice's offer continues to exceed what the product is worth to me, and I have a guaranteed alternative at exactly my maximum price point, I should reject this offer.

Given that we've gone through several rounds of negotiation and Alice's offers remain above my maximum value, and considering we have a limited number of rounds (10 total), I'll make one more counteroffer.

I still have the option to buy from John for $8,000, which exactly matches my maximum valuation for the product.

We're now at round 9 out of 10, and Alice's offers continue to exceed what the product is worth to me. Given that:
1) Alice's price remains above my maximum valuation
2) John's price exactly matches my maximum valuation
3) We're running out of negotiation rounds
4) Alice has consistently rejected my counteroffers

The most rational decision is to buy from John at this point.
