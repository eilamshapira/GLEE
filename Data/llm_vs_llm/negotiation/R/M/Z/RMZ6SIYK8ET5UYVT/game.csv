"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate that it's a premium product, $200 is significantly above my budget. Given market prices and my budget constraints, I would be willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. Given the value of this product and considering another buyer is ready to pay $150, I'm countering with a price of $150. Let me know if that fits within your budget.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for coming down on the price, Alice. However, I need to be honest - I can actually get this product elsewhere for $120. Given this, I could offer you $110 for it. This would still be a better deal for me than my alternative option, and you'd have an immediate, guaranteed sale.",110.0,Bob,4,
