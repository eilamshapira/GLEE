"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you my premium product at $200. It’s a top-notch item and I believe it’s well worth the investment. Let me know if you’re interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $120 to me
2. John is willing to sell it for $120
3. Alice's offer of $200 is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price

The logical choice is to reject Alice's offer. Alice's initial price of $200 is well above both my maximum value ($120) and John's alternative price ($120). I'll reject this offer to either negotiate a better price or ultimately buy from John if needed.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but leaves room for negotiation, while also acknowledging Alice's product quality.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate that it's a premium product, $200 is significantly above my budget. Given market prices and my budget constraints, I would be willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. Given the value of this product and considering another buyer is ready to pay $150, I'm countering with a price of $150. Let me know if that fits within your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given that:
1. Alice's new offer of $150 is still higher than John's price ($120)
2. The product is worth no more than $120 to me
3. I have the guaranteed option to buy from John at $120

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $150 when I can buy the same product from John for $120. Since Alice's price is still significantly above John's price, and above my maximum value, I should reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that moves closer to a reasonable price point while also addressing Alice's mention of another buyer.

{""message"": ""Thank you for coming down on the price, Alice. However, I need to be honest - I can actually get this product elsewhere for $120. Given this, I could offer you $110 for it. This would still be a better deal for me than my alternative option, and you'd have an immediate, guaranteed sale."", ""product_price"": 110}"
