Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'll really like. I'm offering it to you for $200."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to buy the product for $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Okay, I need to make a decision. Selling to Bob for $80 is less than what I need to get for the product ($120 minimum), so I won't do that.

Therefore: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Bob. I'm not quite there yet. How about we meet in the middle at $160?"", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90, which is closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
