"Alice, I appreciate you offering me the product. However, $18000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it, which is fair considering the value I place on it. Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $12000. I understand that $18000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than your offer. I'm willing to compromise and lower my price. I can offer it to you for $17000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. Let me know if this price works for you.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $17000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there. I'm happy to offer $14000 for the product. This is a good price considering its worth to me and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
