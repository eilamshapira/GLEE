Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you offering me the product. However, $18000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it, which is fair considering the value I place on it. Let me know if that works for you.

I reject Bob's offer of $12,000 because it's lower than the minimum value I have for the product, which is $15,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer to see if we can meet at a mutually beneficial price. My counteroffer is $17,000."

I understand that $18,000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than your offer. I'm willing to compromise and lower my price.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $17000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there. I'm happy to offer $14000 for the product. This is a good price considering its worth to me and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

I decide to sell the product to John for $15,000. Although Bob's offer of $14,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still lower than what John is willing to pay. Since I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, which meets my minimum requirement, I choose to accept his offer and end the negotiation with Bob."
