"Hi Bob! I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. I believe it would be valuable for you, and I'm willing to sell it for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $120 is a bit high for me. I can find similar products for less elsewhere. Would you consider selling it for $85? This would be a fair price that works better for my budget.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your budget concerns, $85 is still a bit low considering the product's quality and value. How about we meet in the middle at $100? This is already a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,
