Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. I believe it would be valuable for you, and I'm willing to sell it for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $120 is a bit high for me. I can find similar products for less elsewhere. Would you consider selling it for $85? This would be a fair price that works better for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe there's room for negotiation since Bob is showing genuine interest. I'll try to find a middle ground between our initial positions.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your budget concerns, $85 is still a bit low considering the product's quality and value. How about we meet in the middle at $100? This is already a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}"
