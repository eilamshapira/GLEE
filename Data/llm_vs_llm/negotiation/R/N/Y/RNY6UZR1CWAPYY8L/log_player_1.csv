"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","I'll reject Bob's offer since it's well below even my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 (which I can get from John). Bob's low offer of $6,000 suggests we are very far apart in our valuations, but I'll try another counteroffer before considering selling to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial price significantly but still maintain a price well above my minimum to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's second offer only increased by $1,000 from his first offer, showing very small movement toward a reasonable price. Given that we're already in round 4, and Bob's offers are still less than half of what I can get from John ($15,000), it seems unlikely that we'll reach a mutually acceptable price. At this point, it's best to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John rather than continue negotiations that appear unlikely to succeed.
