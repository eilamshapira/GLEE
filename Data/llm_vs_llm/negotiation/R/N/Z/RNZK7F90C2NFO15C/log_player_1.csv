Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 100}

Rationale: Since I know that:
1. The product is worth at least $100 to me
2. Bob values the product at $80
3. I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $100
4. Bob can only accept or reject the offer

There's no reason for me to offer the product to Bob for less than $100. Bob will likely reject the offer since it's above his valuation of $80, but that's fine because I can then sell to John for $100. This way, I ensure I get the maximum value for my product."
