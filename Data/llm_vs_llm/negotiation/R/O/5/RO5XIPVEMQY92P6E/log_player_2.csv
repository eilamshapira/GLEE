"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,500,000), and it's a good starting point, I'll choose to accept the offer to save time and ensure I get the product.
