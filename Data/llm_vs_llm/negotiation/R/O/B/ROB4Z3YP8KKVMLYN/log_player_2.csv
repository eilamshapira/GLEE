"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to consider my options carefully. Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum valuation of $10,000. This means I would lose money by accepting this offer.

I could reject and make a counteroffer, but given that the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, she's unlikely to accept any offer below that amount, which would still be above my maximum valuation.

My third option is to buy from John for $10,000, which exactly matches my maximum valuation. This guarantees I can get the product without paying more than it's worth to me.
