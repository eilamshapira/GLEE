# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Given that Alice's offer is $12,000, which is the same price as John's, and knowing that the product is worth only $8,000 to Alice, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. Alice has room to lower the price since her cost is $8,000, and I might be able to get a better deal through negotiation.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her cost, leaving room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12,000 is quite high for this product. Given market conditions, I would be willing to purchase it for $9,000.

However, since the product is worth $8,000 to her, there's still room for a better deal. The $11,000 offer is better than John's $12,000, but I should try to negotiate further down.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still maintain a price that's reasonable considering Alice's cost.
