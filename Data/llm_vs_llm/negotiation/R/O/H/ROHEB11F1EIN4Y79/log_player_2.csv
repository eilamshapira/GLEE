"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to make a decision here. Alice is offering the product for $15,000, but I know the product is only worth $12,000 to me at most. John is willing to sell it for exactly $12,000.

Alice's current offer is too high, exceeding my maximum value. Since I have the option to make a counteroffer, I'll reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's below my maximum value but gives room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": $9,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has lowered her price to $13,000, which is still higher than John's price of $12,000. Since John is offering the same product for $12,000, and that's my maximum value for the product, I should either try to negotiate further with Alice or go with John's offer.

Since Alice's offer is still above John's price, and John's price matches my maximum value:
