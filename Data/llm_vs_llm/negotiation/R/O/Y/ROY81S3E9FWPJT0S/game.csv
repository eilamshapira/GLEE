"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product's value, but based on my budget and current market conditions, I'm willing to offer you $9000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is too low considering the product's value. I understand you're working within a budget, but I know this product will provide significant value to you. I can come down from my initial price - I'm offering it for $11000, which represents a substantial discount from my first offer while still reflecting the product's worth.",11000.0,Alice,3,
