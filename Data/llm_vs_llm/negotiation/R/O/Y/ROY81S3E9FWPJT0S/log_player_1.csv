Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product's value, but based on my budget and current market conditions, I'm willing to offer you $9000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a new counteroffer to Bob. $9,000 is too close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and I know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob. There's still room for negotiation to reach a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is too low considering the product's value. I understand you're working within a budget, but I know this product will provide significant value to you.
