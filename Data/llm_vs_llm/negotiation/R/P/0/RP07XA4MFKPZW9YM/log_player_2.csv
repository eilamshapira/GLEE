"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and Alice's initial offer is $12,000, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer. I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a lower price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $11,500 is still above my budget of $10,000. While it's a slight improvement from her initial offer, I'm not willing to pay that much for the product.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and consider making another counteroffer. However, since I have the option to buy the product from John for $10,000, which is within my budget, I might not make another counteroffer if I don't think Alice will be willing to meet me at or below $10,000.

For now, I'll reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's latest offer was $11,500, I'll try to meet her halfway between her offer and my previous counteroffer of $9,000. However, I'll also keep in mind that I have the option to buy the product from John for $10,000, so I won't go much higher than that.

My new counteroffer will be $10,000, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay for the product.
