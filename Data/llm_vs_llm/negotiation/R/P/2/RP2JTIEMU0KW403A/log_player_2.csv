"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Considering Alice's worth for the product is $800,000, I'll aim to meet her halfway between her worth and my maximum budget.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but it's getting closer to a reasonable price. Since I believe I can still negotiate a better price, and I have the option to buy from John for $1,500,000, I'll choose to reject Alice's offer again and try to negotiate further.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer that is lower than Alice's latest offer, but still trying to find a mutually acceptable price. Considering Alice's previous offer was $1,100,000, I'll try to split the difference between that and my previous offer of $1,000,000.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $1,075,000 is getting very close to a price I'm comfortable with. Considering she's already come down significantly from her initial offer, I think it's likely she's nearing her bottom line. Since $1,075,000 is still below my maximum budget of $1,500,000, and it's a better deal than buying from John, I'll choose to accept Alice's offer.
