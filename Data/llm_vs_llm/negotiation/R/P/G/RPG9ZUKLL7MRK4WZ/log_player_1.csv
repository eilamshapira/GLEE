Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price for such a premium item."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, $18000 is above my budget. I would like to offer you $14000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Reasoning (not part of response): I'll accept Bob's offer of $14,000 because:
1. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000
2. Bob's offer gives me $2,000 more than John's guaranteed offer
3. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Bob might withdraw or reduce his offer
4. The offer seems reasonable given the initial negotiation, showing respect for both parties' interests"
