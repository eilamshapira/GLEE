"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $11500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth.",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $11500 is quite steep for this product. Given the current market conditions and comparable products available, I'd be willing to pay $9000. This would still provide you with a reasonable profit margin while being more affordable for me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $9000 is too low for this quality product. I can come down to $10500, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents good value given the product's worth.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. I can see we're making progress, but $10500 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I can increase my offer to $9800. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and would provide you with a good profit margin.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer. We're getting closer, but I think we can find a middle ground. I can offer $10000, which is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. This is a significant reduction from my previous offers.",10000.0,Alice,5,
