"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $11500 is quite steep for this product. Given the current market conditions and comparable products available, I'd be willing to pay $9000. This would still provide you with a reasonable profit margin while being more affordable for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. $9,000 is too low considering the product's value. Let me propose a more moderate price reduction.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $9,000 is too low for this quality product. I can come down to $10,500, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents good value given the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $9,000 is too low for this quality product. I can come down to $10,500, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents good value given the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. I can see we're making progress, but $10500 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I can increase my offer to $9800. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and would provide you with a good profit margin. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make another counteroffer. Bob is moving up, which shows he's serious, but there's still room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer. We're getting closer, but I think we can find a middle ground. I can offer $10,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. This is a significant reduction from my previous offers."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
