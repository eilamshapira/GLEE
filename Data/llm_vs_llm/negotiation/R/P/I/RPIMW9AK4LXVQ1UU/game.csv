"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $250 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Given my budget constraints, I can offer $100 for the product. This is a fair price that works within my means.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is significantly below its value.  I'm willing to come down to $200. I believe this is a fair compromise.",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $200 is still more than I can justify spending. I can increase my offer to $125. This is a meaningful increase from my previous offer and reflects the maximum I can reasonably spend on this product.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're getting closer. I'm willing to accept $175 for the product. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of what's being offered.",175.0,Alice,5,
