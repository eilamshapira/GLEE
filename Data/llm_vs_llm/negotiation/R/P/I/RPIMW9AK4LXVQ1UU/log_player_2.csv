"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $250. I believe it holds significant value and would be a great asset to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I should reject this offer since $250 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $150, and I know I can always buy from John at $150.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than my maximum value, giving room for negotiation while still being reasonable.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $250 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Given my budget constraints, I can offer $100 for the product. This is a fair price that works within my means."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is significantly below its value.  I'm willing to come down to $200. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's offer of $200 is still above my maximum value of $150, and I know I can buy from John at $150. Therefore, I should reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly but still stay well below my maximum value of $150.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $200 is still more than I can justify spending. I can increase my offer to $125. This is a meaningful increase from my previous offer and reflects the maximum I can reasonably spend on this product."", ""product_price"": 125}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're getting closer. I'm willing to accept $175 for the product. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer of $175 is still higher than John's price of $150, and John's price is at my maximum value, it makes more sense to buy from John at this point. Alice has stated this is her ""final offer"" at $175, suggesting further negotiation might not be productive.
