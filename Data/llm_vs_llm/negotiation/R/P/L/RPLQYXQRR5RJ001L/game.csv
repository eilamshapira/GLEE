"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $900000 is moving in the right direction, it's still below what I believe is fair value for this product. Given its quality and market position, I can offer it to you for $1050000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial price and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the reduction in price, but $1050000 is still slightly above what I'm willing to pay. Considering the product's value to me and the alternatives I have, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $980000. I believe this is a reasonable price and I'm willing to finalize the deal if we can agree on this amount.",980000.0,Bob,4,
