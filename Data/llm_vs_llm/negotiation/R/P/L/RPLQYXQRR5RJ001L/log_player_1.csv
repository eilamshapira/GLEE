Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since $900,000 is closer to my target, but still has room for negotiation. The fact that Bob countered with a reasonable offer suggests he has genuine interest and likely values the product higher than $900,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $900,000 is moving in the right direction, it's still below what I believe is fair value for this product. Given its quality and market position, I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial price and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the reduction in price, but $1050000 is still slightly above what I'm willing to pay. Considering the product's value to me and the alternatives I have, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $980000. I believe this is a reasonable price and I'm willing to finalize the deal if we can agree on this amount. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $980,000. This is a good price that's significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Bob has shown he's a serious buyer by making reasonable counteroffers and increasing his initial offer. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal, and $980,000 represents a good profit margin over my alternative option with John."
