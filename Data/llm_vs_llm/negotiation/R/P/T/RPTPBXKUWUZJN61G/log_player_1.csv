"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product and I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start with a high offer. 

{""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is lower than the minimum value of $1,500,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $1,500,000, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I still want to try to negotiate with Bob to see if I can get a better price, so I won't sell to John just yet.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $1,000,000, which is lower than what I'm willing to accept, I'll make a counteroffer that's still high but slightly lower than my initial offer to show that I'm willing to negotiate.

{""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still lower than the minimum value of $1,500,000 that the product is worth to me, but it's getting closer. I'll reject his offer again and try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer is increasing, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous one, but still higher than Bob's current offer, to try to meet him in the middle.

{""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is getting very close to the minimum value of $1,500,000 that the product is worth to me, and it's also close to the price that John is willing to pay. Since I'm running out of rounds and I don't know if Bob will increase his offer further, I think it's time to consider selling to John to ensure I get at least $1,500,000.
