"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $3,000,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,500,000. Since I can always buy from John at $1,500,000, there's no reason to accept an offer that's double that amount. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'll make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000, which gives me room for negotiation if Alice counters. It's also a reasonable starting point since it's a third of Alice's initial offer. If Alice rejects this and counters with a price still above $1,500,000, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $2,500,000 is still significantly above my maximum value of $1,500,000 and above John's guaranteed price. While Alice has reduced her price by $500,000, it's still not competitive with John's offer. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round, as there's still room for negotiation and plenty of rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'll increase my previous offer to $1,200,000. This shows some movement from my initial offer of $1,000,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate, while still staying well below John's price of $1,500,000. This gives Alice room to counter while maintaining my negotiating position. It's still $300,000 below my maximum acceptable price (John's price), so there's room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $2,000,000 shows she's willing to negotiate downward (dropping from $2,500,000 to $2,000,000), but it's still $500,000 above John's price of $1,500,000. Since I would never pay more than John's price, and there are still several rounds left for negotiation, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer. Alice's significant price reductions suggest she might be willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1350000}

I'll offer $1,350,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer of $1,200,000, showing I'm seriously negotiating and willing to move closer to my maximum price. It's still $150,000 below John's price, giving me a better deal if Alice accepts while maintaining some room for a final negotiation if needed. Alice has shown willingness to reduce her price substantially over the previous rounds, so this offer might be more appealing to her while still giving me a better deal than John's offer."
