"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. This premium product is currently on the market for $2000000. However, I'm willing to offer it to you specifically at $1800000. This is a competitive price considering the value it would bring to you. I should mention that I have another interested buyer, John, who is willing to purchase it for $1500000, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1800000 is more than I'm willing to pay. I know you value the product at $1500000. I'm willing to offer $1300000.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to clarify something - the product is worth $1500000 to me, which is my absolute minimum. John is already willing to pay that amount. For me to choose you over a guaranteed buyer, I'd need a better offer. I can come down to $1650000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll receive. If we can't find middle ground above my minimum threshold, I'll need to proceed with John's offer.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
