"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. This premium product is currently on the market for $2,000,000. However, I'm willing to offer it to you specifically at $1,800,000. This is a competitive price considering the value it would bring to you. I should mention that I have another interested buyer, John, who is willing to purchase it for $1,500,000, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1800000 is more than I'm willing to pay. I know you value the product at $1500000. I'm willing to offer $1300000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to clarify something - the product is worth $1,500,000 to me, which is my absolute minimum. John is already willing to pay that amount. For me to choose you over a guaranteed buyer, I'd need a better offer. I can come down to $1,650,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll receive. If we can't find middle ground above my minimum threshold, I'll need to proceed with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 1650000}"
