"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer to purchase the product for $600000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $600000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to counter with $1000000, which I believe still offers great value for the product. What do you say?",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the value this product can bring justifies a higher investment. How about we settle at $950000? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and should meet you halfway.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price. However, $950000 is still above my target budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $700000, which I believe is a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. While I appreciate the increase, $700000 is still below what I'm looking for. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $850000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. Let's consider $825000. This is a further reduction from my last offer and should be closer to your budget while still reflecting the product's value.",825000.0,Alice,5,
