Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer to purchase the product for $600000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the value this product can bring justifies a higher investment.
