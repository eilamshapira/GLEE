"Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $100. Would you be willing to consider this price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $100 is too low for this product's value. While I understand budget constraints, I could offer it to you for $150, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value. Would this work better for you?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you, Alice, for considering my previous offer and for the reduction to $150. I appreciate the effort to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $150 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle but need to stay within my budget. How about $120? It's the highest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the negotiations we've had so far.",120.0,Bob,4,
