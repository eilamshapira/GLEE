Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $100. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I can do better than selling to John right away. Let's continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $100 is too low for this product's value. While I understand budget constraints, I could offer it to you for $150, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value. Would this work better for you?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you, Alice, for considering my previous offer and for the reduction to $150. I appreciate the effort to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $150 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle but need to stay within my budget. How about $120? It's the highest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $120. Since this matches John's guaranteed offer and we've had a respectful negotiation with Bob, it makes sense to conclude the deal here. We've reached a price that meets my minimum acceptable value, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether."
