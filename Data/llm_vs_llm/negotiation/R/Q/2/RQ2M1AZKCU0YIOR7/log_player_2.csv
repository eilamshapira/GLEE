# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range to initiate negotiations. Since I'm looking to spend no more than $120, I'll start with a lower offer to leave room for potential counteroffers from Alice.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $100 is too low for this product's value. While I understand budget constraints, I could offer it to you for $150, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value. Would this work better for you?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $150 is still above my maximum budget of $120. While it's a reduction from her initial offer, it doesn't meet my budget constraint. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, trying to bring the price closer to my target.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

(I'll make another counteroffer after this decision)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer of $150 is still above my budget, I'll try to meet her halfway between her last offer and my previous counteroffer. However, considering my budget constraint of $120, I'll aim slightly below the midpoint to prioritize staying within my limit.

{""message"": ""Thank you, Alice, for considering my previous offer and for the reduction to $150. I appreciate the effort to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $150 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle but need to stay within my budget. How about $120? It's the highest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the negotiations we've had so far."", ""product_price"": 120}"
