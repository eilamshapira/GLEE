"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while staying below Bob's maximum value of $15,000.

{""product_price"": 14,500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","$12,800 is quite low considering Bob values the product at $15,000. I still have several rounds to negotiate a better price, and it's only slightly better than John's offer. I'll reject and make a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from the initial offer but still maintain a strong position for negotiation.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob has increased his offer by $400, which shows he's willing to negotiate upward. The offer of $13,200 is significantly better than John's $12,000, but I believe there's still room for a better deal since we're only in round 4 of 10, and Bob values the product at $15,000. I'll reject and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll slightly lower my previous offer to show flexibility while still aiming for a good profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob has increased his offer again to $13,400, showing he's willing to meet in the middle. While we could continue negotiating, we're now in round 6 of 10, and the risk of losing the deal increases with each round. This offer is $1,400 better than John's guaranteed offer, and the increments of improvement are getting smaller. I'll accept this offer.
