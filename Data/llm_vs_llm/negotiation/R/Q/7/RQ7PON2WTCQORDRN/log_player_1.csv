"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a high initial offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I get significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.

{""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","I'll reject Bob's offer since it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I could sell to John immediately, I'll try one more negotiation round with Bob since there's potential to earn more than $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from the initial offer but still maintain a strong position well above my minimum price.

{""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's second offer of $600,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and his small increase from $500,000 to $600,000 suggests he might not be willing to reach my minimum price. At this point, it's safer to take John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 rather than risk more rounds of negotiation that might not lead anywhere.
