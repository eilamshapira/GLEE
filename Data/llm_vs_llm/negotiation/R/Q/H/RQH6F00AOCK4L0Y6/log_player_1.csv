"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90 for the product. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Given Bob's counteroffer of $90, which is below the value I place on the product ($100), I will reject it. I will also not accept the product to John at this time.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I can't go down to $90, but I am willing to meet you in the middle. How about $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I was thinking we could do a bit better. How about we meet at $97.50? That way, we're both giving a little and getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Okay, Bob is offering $97.50. This is very close to my floor of $100. I could try to negotiate further, but there's a risk of losing the deal altogether, and I'm getting closer to the point where it's better to just sell to John for $100. Considering the time and the risk of further negotiation, I will accept Bob's offer.
