Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a price that maximizes my earnings while ensuring Bob might still accept.

Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, that's the maximum he would rationally pay. If he rejects my offer, I can still sell to John for $1,200,000, so I don't need to go below that amount.

Given that Bob and I both know the product's value to him is $1,200,000, I should offer a price that makes him at least indifferent between accepting and rejecting. Since there's no incentive for me to offer less than $1,200,000 (as I have a guaranteed buyer at that price), I'll offer Bob exactly the product's value to him.
