"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is the same price that John is offering, and the product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, there's no financial advantage to choosing one seller over the other.
