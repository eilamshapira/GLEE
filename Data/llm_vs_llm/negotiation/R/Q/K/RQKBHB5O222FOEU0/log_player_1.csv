"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($1,500,000) and also lower than what I initially offered ($2,000,000), and considering we have multiple rounds to negotiate, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer that is closer to my initial offer but slightly reduced to show willingness to negotiate.

My counteroffer for Round 3 would be $1,900,000."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. However, it's an increase from his previous offer, indicating some willingness to negotiate. Given that we are only in Round 4 and have 6 more rounds to go, I will reject Bob's offer again and try to meet him halfway between my last offer and his current offer, aiming to bring the price closer to my minimum acceptable value.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

My next step would be to make a counteroffer. Since my last offer was $1,900,000 and Bob's current offer is $900,000, a midpoint would be $1,400,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and compromise while still aiming to get as close as possible to my target price.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it shows he is slowly increasing his offer. Given that we are halfway through the negotiation rounds, I need to decide whether to continue negotiating with Bob or sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000.

Since Bob's offer is increasing, it indicates he is interested in the product, but the gap between his offer and my minimum price is still significant. I will reject his offer again, but this time, I will make a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my previous one, to show I am willing to compromise, but also to encourage Bob to increase his offer more substantially.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

My next counteroffer would be $1,350,000, which is a reduction from my previous offer of $1,400,000, aiming to find a middle ground.
