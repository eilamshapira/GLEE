"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $2,000,000 is well above my maximum value of $1,000,000, and it's also higher than John's guaranteed price of $1,000,000. It wouldn't make sense to accept this offer. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to negotiate a better price with Alice, knowing I always have John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 800000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $800,000. This is strategically lower than John's price of $1,000,000, which gives me room to negotiate upward if needed. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, there's potentially room for a deal that benefits both parties, as any price between $800,000 and $1,500,000 would give Alice a profit. However, I won't go above $1,000,000 since that's both my maximum value and John's asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,900,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000). While Alice has reduced the price by $100,000 from her initial offer, it's still not nearly enough to make it attractive. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round. If Alice continues to make offers well above my maximum value, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 900000}

I'll increase my offer to $900,000. This shows some movement from my previous offer of $800,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate, while still staying below my maximum value and John's price. Since Alice has only made a small concession so far (from $2M to $1.9M), I'm making a modest increase in my offer to encourage more significant movement from her side. The price of $900,000 would still give Alice a $400,000 profit compared to her value of $1.5M, so it's a reasonable offer. If Alice doesn't show more significant movement in response, I can always take John's offer of $1M."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has made a significant movement downward from $1,900,000 to $1,400,000, which shows she's becoming more serious about negotiating. However, this price is still above both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000), so I cannot accept it. Since Alice has shown substantial movement, I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round, possibly with a larger increase to acknowledge her significant price reduction. However, John's offer of $1,000,000 remains a solid backup option if we can't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 950000}

I'll increase my offer to $950,000. This is a strategic move for several reasons:
1. It acknowledges Alice's significant price reduction (from $1.9M to $1.4M) by making a larger increase in my offer
2. It's still below my maximum value and John's price of $1M
3. It would give Alice a $550,000 profit based on her value of $1.5M
4. It's close enough to $1M to signal that I'm serious but also that I won't go much higher
5. If Alice rejects this, I can still either make one final offer closer to $1M or take John's offer

The goal is to show Alice that while I'm willing to negotiate, I have a firm upper limit due to John's alternative offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John for $1,000,000. Here's why:

1. Alice's latest offer ($1,350,000) is still significantly above both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000)
2. While Alice has been making concessions, the rate of decrease suggests she's unlikely to reach $1,000,000 within the remaining rounds
3. We're already in Round 7 of 10, and Alice hasn't yet made an offer below $1,350,000
4. Even though Alice's value is $1,500,000, suggesting room for negotiation, she seems unwilling to go low enough to make a deal viable for me
5. John's guaranteed price of $1,000,000 is at my maximum value, and continuing negotiations risks losing time without achieving a better outcome

Therefore, it's most rational to take John's certain offer rather than continue negotiations that may not lead to a better outcome."
