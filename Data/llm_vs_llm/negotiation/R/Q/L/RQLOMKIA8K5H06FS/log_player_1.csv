"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start by making a relatively high offer to maximize my potential earnings. I can always adjust my price later based on Bob's response.

{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer is at the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($8,000), and I have the option to sell it to John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in accepting Bob's offer at this point. However, I also don't want to give up on the potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob.

I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I'll send a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $8,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. This will give Bob an opportunity to reconsider and potentially meet me at a higher price point.

{""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer of $9,000 is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and it's also closer to my initial offer. Considering that I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation, I think $9,000 is a reasonable price.

I'll choose to accept Bob's offer, as it's a good compromise and I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing for a higher price.
