"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product at a competitive price and believe it will meet your needs excellently. Let me know if you have any questions! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to make a decision that maximizes my value while staying within my constraints.

The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me.
Alice is offering it for $10,500, which exceeds both my valuation and the alternative option.
John is offering the same product for $8,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

If I accept Alice's offer at $10,500, I would be paying $2,500 more than the product is worth to me.
John's offer at $8,000 is the better option.
