"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $14000 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $10000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $13000.  This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $13000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think we can find a better price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11500. I believe this is a reasonable compromise between our valuations.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $12250?  This price reflects my effort to reach a compromise while still valuing the product fairly.",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle. Your offer of $12250 is closer to what I'm willing to pay. However, I'd like to make a small adjustment to see if we can finalize the deal. I'm willing to offer $12000, which is very close to your proposed price. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
