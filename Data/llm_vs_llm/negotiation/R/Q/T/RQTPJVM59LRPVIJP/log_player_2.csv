"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to potentially sell you this incredible product. Given its exceptional value, I'm willing to offer it to you for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given the information:
- The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me
- Alice is offering to sell it for $2,400,000
- John is willing to sell the same product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer is double what the product is worth to me and double what John is charging. There's no reason to accept this offer or even make a counteroffer when I can get the same product at a fair price from John.
