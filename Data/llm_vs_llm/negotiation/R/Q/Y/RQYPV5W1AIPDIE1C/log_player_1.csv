"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 300}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","$70 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Since I can sell to John for $150, I would never accept an offer below that amount. Bob's offer of $70 is less than half of my minimum price, which suggests we might be quite far apart in our valuations. However, I'll give the negotiation another try with a counter-offer rather than immediately selling to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial price significantly but still maintain a price well above my minimum to leave room for further negotiation.

{""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob has only increased his offer by $10 (from $70 to $80), which is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Given that we've had two rounds of offers and Bob's increases are very small, it seems unlikely that we'll reach an agreement above $150. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $150, it's now rational to take that option rather than continue negotiations that appear unlikely to reach my minimum price.
