"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given that the product is worth no more than $100 to me, Alice's offer of $300 is much too high. I also know that I can buy the product from John for $100, which matches my maximum valuation. Since Alice's initial offer is so far above what I'm willing to pay, I'll reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still allows room for negotiation.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has reduced her price from $300 to $250, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but this is still far above both my maximum valuation of $100 and John's fixed price of $100. There's no reason for me to accept this offer when I can either continue negotiating or buy from John at a much better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has come down from $300 to $250, I'll increase my offer slightly to show I'm negotiating in good faith, but I'll still keep it well below my maximum of $100.
