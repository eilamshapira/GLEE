"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob. However, $8000 is significantly below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $10000? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",10000.0,Alice,3,
