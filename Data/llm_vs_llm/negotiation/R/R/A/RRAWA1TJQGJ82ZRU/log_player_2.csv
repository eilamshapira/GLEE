"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is lower than John's fixed price of $15,000 but still quite high (considering the product is worth $10,000 to Alice), I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. There are still 9 rounds remaining, so there's room for negotiation to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's $14,000, but not so low that it would be considered unreasonable. Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, I'll offer a price that gives her a reasonable profit while still being advantageous for me.

{""product_price"": 11500}

This offer would give Alice a $1,500 profit (15% margin) while saving me $3,500 compared to her initial offer. It's also much better than John's price of $15,000, giving us both room to negotiate if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her price by $1,000 from her initial offer, showing some willingness to negotiate. However, there's still room for a better deal since we have 7 rounds remaining. The current offer of $13,000 is still significantly higher than her cost of $10,000. It's better than John's price of $15,000, but I should continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice came down $1,000 from her initial offer, so I'll increase my previous offer by a similar amount to show good faith in the negotiation. This keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a fair price.

{""product_price"": 12000}

This offer would give Alice a $2,000 profit (20% margin), which is reasonable, while still being significantly better than both her previous offer of $13,000 and John's price of $15,000. It splits the difference between our last positions and shows I'm willing to move toward a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has come down to $12,750, which is a $250 reduction from her previous offer. We're getting closer to a fair price, and she's showing continued willingness to negotiate. However, since we still have 5 rounds left and the price is still well above her cost, I'll reject this offer to try for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice reduced her price by $250, so I'll increase my previous offer by a similar amount to maintain the momentum of the negotiation and show willingness to meet in the middle.

{""product_price"": 12300}

This offer would still give Alice a healthy profit of $2,300 (23% margin) while being more reasonable for me. It's only $450 below her last offer of $12,750, showing we're getting closer to agreement. With 4 rounds remaining after this, there's still room to negotiate, but we're moving toward a fair compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her price to $12,600, which is only a $150 decrease from her previous offer. We're getting very close to a final price, and the gaps between our offers are getting smaller. With only 3 rounds remaining after this one, and considering the risk that negotiations could break down, I think it's reasonable to accept this offer. $12,600 is significantly better than John's price of $15,000, and while Alice is making a good profit, it's within a reasonable range.
