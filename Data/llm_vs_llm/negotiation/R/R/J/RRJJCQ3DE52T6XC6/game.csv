"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I know this product is worth about $8000 in the market, which is also my maximum budget for this purchase. In fact, I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the identical product for $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer you $7500 for the product, which allows you to make the sale quickly while giving me a small discount compared to my alternative option. Let me know if this works for you.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer and your interest in doing business with me. While I understand you mentioned another seller offering the product at $8000, I should clarify that this product is worth at least $8000 to me, and I'm not able to sell below this price. However, I'm willing to match the price you mentioned from the other seller. I can offer you the product for $8000, which is fair market value. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while ensuring you get the quality product you're looking for. Would this work for you?",8000.0,Alice,3,
