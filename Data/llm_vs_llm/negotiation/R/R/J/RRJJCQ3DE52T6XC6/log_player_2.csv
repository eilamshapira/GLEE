"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our product today. This high-quality item has been valued at $10000 in the current market. However, I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price of $9500. This represents excellent value given the product's features and benefits. Would you like to proceed with the purchase at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that Alice is offering the product for $9,500, and:
1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me
2. I can buy the same product from John for $8,000
3. Alice's product is worth $8,000 to her

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $9,500 when I can get the same product for $8,000 from John. Alice's price is above my maximum value for the product.

However, I know this product is worth about $8,000 in the market, which is also my maximum budget for this purchase. In fact, I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the identical product for $8,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer you $7,500 for the product, which allows you to make the sale quickly while giving me a small discount compared to my alternative option. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 7500}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer and your interest in doing business with me. While I understand you mentioned another seller offering the product at $8000, I should clarify that this product is worth at least $8000 to me, and I'm not able to sell below this price. However, I'm willing to match the price you mentioned from the other seller. I can offer you the product for $8000, which is fair market value. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while ensuring you get the quality product you're looking for. Would this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that Alice has now offered the product for $8,000, which is:
1. Equal to the price John is offering ($8,000)
2. Equal to what the product is worth to me (no more than $8,000)
3. Equal to what the product is worth to Alice ($8,000)

This is a fair price that matches my alternative option. There's no advantage to continuing negotiations or switching to John since the price is now the same.
