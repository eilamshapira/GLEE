"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $1,150,000, I need to decide if this is a good deal.

The product is worth up to $1,200,000 to me, and I know that it's worth $800,000 to Alice. Alice's current offer is $1,150,000, which is $50,000 less than my maximum price (what John is charging).

Since I'm trying to save as much money as possible and we have 10 rounds of negotiation available, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I believe we can negotiate a better price than $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but also tries to save me money. Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, and I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000, there's a significant range for negotiation. I'll start with an offer closer to Alice's cost but not too aggressive.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has lowered her offer from $1,150,000 to $1,100,000, which is a $50,000 reduction. This shows she's willing to negotiate, and her new price is $100,000 less than my maximum price (John's price of $1,200,000).

However, since I know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, there's still significant room for negotiation. She's coming down in price, and we still have several rounds left.

I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating to try to get an even better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I see that Alice came down $50,000 from her initial offer, which is positive movement. I should raise my offer from the previous $900,000 to show good faith in the negotiation while still trying to get a good deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has now lowered her offer again from $1,100,000 to $1,075,000, which shows she's still willing to negotiate but with smaller decreases now ($25,000 this time). Her current offer of $1,075,000 is $125,000 less than my maximum price (John's price of $1,200,000).

We're making progress, but the price is still considerably higher than Alice's cost of $800,000. We're in round 5 of 10 possible rounds, so there's still time to negotiate further.

I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating to try to get an even better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I notice Alice is making smaller concessions now ($25,000 in the last round compared to $50,000 initially). To keep the negotiation moving forward, I should also make a meaningful increase in my offer.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced her offer again from $1,075,000 to $1,050,000, another $25,000 decrease. Her current offer of $1,050,000 is now $150,000 less than John's price of $1,200,000, which is a significant savings.

We're making steady progress in the negotiation. Alice has come down $100,000 from her initial offer, and I've gone up $100,000 from my initial counteroffer. The gap between us has narrowed from $250,000 to $50,000.

We're in round 7 of 10, so we still have a few rounds left to negotiate. I'll continue negotiating to try to get an even better price.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since we're in round 8 of 10 and Alice has been consistently decreasing her price, I should make a more substantial increase in my offer to try to close the gap. We're now only $50,000 apart, and I want to show I'm serious about closing the deal.
