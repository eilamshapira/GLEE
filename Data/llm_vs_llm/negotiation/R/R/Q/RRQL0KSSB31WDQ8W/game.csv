"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $3000000 is far beyond what I can consider for this product. I have other options available in the market for much less. I would like to make a counteroffer of $600000, which I believe is a fair price considering market conditions.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, I must stress that the product's unique quality and market demand justify a significantly higher price. Considering recent interest from another buyer and our analysis of market conditions, my counteroffer is $2000000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product. Please let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $2000000 is still well beyond what I can justify for this product. While I understand you're emphasizing its unique quality, I have a reliable alternative offer at $800000. However, I value the possibility of doing business with you and would be willing to offer $700000, which is a fair price that still provides you with good value.",700000.0,Bob,4,
