Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $3000000 is far beyond what I can consider for this product. I have other options available in the market for much less. I would like to make a counteroffer of $600000, which I believe is a fair price considering market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, I must stress that the product's unique quality and market demand justify a significantly higher price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $2000000 is still well beyond what I can justify for this product. While I understand you're emphasizing its unique quality, I have a reliable alternative offer at $800000. However, I value the possibility of doing business with you and would be willing to offer $700000, which is a fair price that still provides you with good value.
