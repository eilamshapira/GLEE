"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you my exclusive product. Iâ€™m starting our discussion with a selling price of $3000000. I believe this product reflects exceptional quality and value, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $3,000,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000. Since I can always buy from John for $800,000, there's no reason to accept such a high price. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $3,000,000 is far beyond what I can consider for this product. I have other options available in the market for much less. I would like to make a counteroffer of $600,000, which I believe is a fair price considering market conditions."", ""product_price"": 600000}

I'm starting with an offer below my maximum price of $800,000 to leave room for negotiation. Since I can always buy from John at $800,000, I want to try to get a better deal from Alice. Starting at $600,000 gives me room to increase my offer in future rounds while still potentially saving money compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, I must stress that the product's unique quality and market demand justify a significantly higher price. Considering recent interest from another buyer and our analysis of market conditions, my counteroffer is $2000000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $2,000,000 is still far above my maximum value of $800,000. While she has reduced the price significantly from her initial offer, it's still more than twice what I can justify paying, especially since I have John's guaranteed offer of $800,000. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, trying to bring the price down to a more reasonable level."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $2,000,000 is still well beyond what I can justify for this product. While I understand you're emphasizing its unique quality, I have a reliable alternative offer at $800,000. However, I value the possibility of doing business with you and would be willing to offer $700,000, which is a fair price that still provides you with good value."", ""product_price"": 700000}

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $600,000 to $700,000 to show good faith in negotiations while still staying below my maximum price. This price gives me room for one more potential increase if needed while keeping my position strong since I have John's $800,000 offer as a backup. It's important to signal to Alice that I have alternatives while still showing willingness to negotiate."
