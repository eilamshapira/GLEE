"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth at least $10,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at $10,000, I'll start with a high initial offer to test Bob's willingness to pay and leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $5,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 (and even below John's guaranteed offer), and it's only round 2, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still keep it well above my minimum threshold, showing some flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiating position.

{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's new offer of $6,000 is still significantly below both my minimum acceptable price and John's guaranteed offer of $10,000. Since Bob has only increased his offer by $1,000 (from $5,000 to $6,000), it doesn't seem like he's moving towards a price point that would be acceptable to me. Given this pattern and the fact that I have a guaranteed $10,000 from John, I'll choose to sell to John rather than continue negotiations that don't appear promising.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
