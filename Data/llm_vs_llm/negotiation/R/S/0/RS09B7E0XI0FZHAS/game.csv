"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200.  Let me know what you think!",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $200 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $100 to me, and I can actually purchase it from another seller, John, for exactly $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $75 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to the other seller. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is just too low for me. I understand it's a tough market, but I'm willing to come down to $125. It's still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at that price.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, I need to be transparent that I have a firm alternative option to purchase this exact product from John for $100. Since that's also my maximum budget for this item, I can't justify paying more than that. To make it worth switching to you as my seller, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $90 for the product, which saves me a bit compared to my alternative while still giving you a sale. Does that work for you?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your situation and appreciate your offer. However, $90 is simply too low for me.  To make this work, I need to be closer to $110. I'm confident this product is worth it for you, and this price still gives you a good deal compared to John. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price. Your offer of $110 is getting closer, but I still need to be practical about this. The product is worth exactly $100 to me, which happens to be the same price John is offering. For me to choose you over John, I'd need at least the same price or better. I can go up to $95, which is my final offer - it saves me $5 compared to John while still giving you the sale. If we can't make this work, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer. What do you say?",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $105. This is a compromise, and it's the closest I can go without losing too much on the sale. If you're serious about getting this product, I hope you'll reconsider and accept this offer. ",105.0,Alice,7,
