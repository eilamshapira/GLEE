"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $200 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $100 to me, and I can actually purchase it from another seller, John, for exactly $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $75 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to the other seller. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is just too low for me. I understand it's a tough market, but I'm willing to come down to $125. It's still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at that price."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, I need to be transparent that I have a firm alternative option to purchase this exact product from John for $100. Since that's also my maximum budget for this item, I can't justify paying more than that. To make it worth switching to you as my seller, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $90 for the product, which saves me a bit compared to my alternative while still giving you a sale. Does that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your situation and appreciate your offer. However, $90 is simply too low for me.  To make this work, I need to be closer to $110. I'm confident this product is worth it for you, and this price still gives you a good deal compared to John. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price. Your offer of $110 is getting closer, but I still need to be practical about this. The product is worth exactly $100 to me, which happens to be the same price John is offering. For me to choose you over John, I'd need at least the same price or better. I can go up to $95, which is my final offer - it saves me $5 compared to John while still giving you the sale. If we can't make this work, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

Round 7

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $105. This is a compromise, and it's the closest I can go without losing too much on the sale. If you're serious about getting this product, I hope you'll reconsider and accept this offer.
