"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to analyze this offer carefully:

1. Alice is offering the product for $200
2. The product is worth no more than $100 to me
3. I know John will sell me the product for $100
4. Alice's price is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation and John's alternative

Since Alice's price ($200) is double the price I can get from John ($100) and exceeds my maximum valuation, there's no reason to accept this offer. I should either reject and make a counteroffer or buy from John immediately.

Given that I have 10 rounds of negotiation available, I'll reject Alice's offer first to see if I can negotiate an even better price than John's $100.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $200 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $100 to me, and I can actually purchase it from another seller, John, for exactly $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $75 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to the other seller. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is just too low for me. I understand it's a tough market, but I'm willing to come down to $125. It's still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has lowered her price to $125, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but this is still above the $100 price I can get from John, and above my maximum valuation.

Since I know I can get the product for $100 from John, and that's my maximum valuation anyway, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $125. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer to see if I can get an even better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, I need to be transparent that I have a firm alternative option to purchase this exact product from John for $100. Since that's also my maximum budget for this item, I can't justify paying more than that. To make it worth switching to you as my seller, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $90 for the product, which saves me a bit compared to my alternative while still giving you a sale. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your situation and appreciate your offer. However, $90 is simply too low for me.  To make this work, I need to be closer to $110. I'm confident this product is worth it for you, and this price still gives you a good deal compared to John. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has now come down to $110, which is getting closer to John's price of $100, but it's still $10 more than what I can get from John. 

Since:
1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me
2. I can buy the exact same product from John for $100
3. Alice is still asking for more than that alternative

There's no reason for me to accept this offer. I'll reject and make one more counteroffer to see if Alice will match or beat John's price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price. Your offer of $110 is getting closer, but I still need to be practical about this. The product is worth exactly $100 to me, which happens to be the same price John is offering. For me to choose you over John, I'd need at least the same price or better. I can go up to $95, which is my final offer - it saves me $5 compared to John while still giving you the sale. If we can't make this work, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $105. This is a compromise, and it's the closest I can go without losing too much on the sale. If you're serious about getting this product, I hope you'll reconsider and accept this offer.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has now offered $105, which is still $5 more than John's price of $100. 

Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me
2. I can buy the exact same product from John for $100
3. Alice is still asking for more than both my valuation and the alternative price

There's no economic reason for me to accept this offer. I've been clear about my position, and Alice hasn't met the competitive price. At this point, it makes more sense to buy from John rather than continue negotiating.
