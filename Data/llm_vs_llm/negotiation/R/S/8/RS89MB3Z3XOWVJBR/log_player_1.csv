Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make a strategic decision about the price I should offer to Bob. I want to maximize my earnings, but I also need to consider the possibility of Bob rejecting my offer.

If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell the product to John for $150, which is my minimum acceptable value. Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I need to balance between setting a price high enough to make good profit and not so high that Bob will definitely reject it.

I'll offer a price that gives me a meaningful premium over my guaranteed $150 from John, but not so high that most reasonable buyers would reject it outright.
