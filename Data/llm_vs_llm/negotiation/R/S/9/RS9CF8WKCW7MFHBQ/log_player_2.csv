"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($800,000), I will reject her offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm not sure what Alice's bottom line is, I'll start with a low offer and see how she responds.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,000,000 is still higher than I'm willing to pay, but it's a significant decrease from her initial offer. I'm not ready to accept this offer yet, as I believe I can get a better deal. I'll reject her offer again and make another counteroffer to see if I can get her to come down further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer decreased by $500,000 from $1,500,000 to $1,000,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between her new offer and my previous counteroffer. My previous counteroffer was $500,000, so I'll increase that by $250,000 to $750,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my target price, but it's still higher than I'm willing to pay. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $800,000, I don't see a reason to accept Alice's offer. I'll reject her offer again, but I'll also consider the fact that I'm running out of rounds and John's offer is looking more attractive.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer is now $900,000, and I know I can buy the product from John for $800,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than John's price, but still lower than Alice's offer. This way, I'm giving Alice a chance to beat John's price and make a sale.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $875,000 is still higher than I'm willing to pay, and it's only $75,000 away from my maximum budget of $800,000 being a better deal from John. At this point, I think it's unlikely that Alice will come down to my target price, and John's offer is looking more attractive. I'll consider buying from John, as it's a better deal.
