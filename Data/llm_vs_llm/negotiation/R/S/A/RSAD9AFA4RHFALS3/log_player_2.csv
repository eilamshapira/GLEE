"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $90. Would you like to buy it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $80 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering it for $90, which is more than what it's worth to me
3. John is offering the same product for $80
4. If I accept Alice's offer, I'll be paying $10 more than the product's value to me
5. If I buy from John, I'll pay exactly what the product is worth to me

The logical choice is to buy from John since:
- It saves me $10 compared to Alice's offer
- The price matches the product's value to me ($80)
- There's no benefit in accepting Alice's higher price
