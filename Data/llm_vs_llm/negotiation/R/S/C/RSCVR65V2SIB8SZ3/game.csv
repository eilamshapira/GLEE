"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $500000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.",500000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. However, $500000 is significantly below my minimum value for the product. I am willing to consider a price of $1500000, which I believe still offers you a great deal considering the unique value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still reflects the product's worth. Please let me know if this works for you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is still above my comfortable spending limit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. I'd like to propose $700000 for the product. This price takes into account the product's value while also considering my budget constraints.",700000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, thank you for your latest offer. While I appreciate your attempt to find a middle ground, $700000 is still below my minimum threshold. I am willing to lower my price further to $1100000, which I believe is a fair compromise given the product's value. Please let me know if this works for you.",1100000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. Given your constraints and the value of the product, I'm willing to reduce the price to $1050000. This is my final offer before considering other buyers. Let me know if this works for you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
