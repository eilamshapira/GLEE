Hello Bob! I have a product I'm offering for sale. It's a high-quality item that I'm selling for $250. I believe this is a fair price given its value and quality. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?,250.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for offering. That price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $50 for the product.",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $50, I'm afraid that's too low for me to accept. The product is of significant value and quality. I could come down to $200, which I think is quite reasonable considering what you're getting. How does that sound?",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $200 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $70?  That's a fair offer.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $70, but I'm still quite a bit away from what I can accept for this product. Given its quality and value, I could come down to $175, which is significantly lower than my initial price. This is a substantial discount from my original asking price. Would this work for you?",175.0,Alice,5,
