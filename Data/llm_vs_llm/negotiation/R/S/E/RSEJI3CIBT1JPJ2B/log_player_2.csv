"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a product I'm offering for sale. It's a high-quality item that I'm selling for $250. I believe this is a fair price given its value and quality. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $50, I'm afraid that's too low for me to accept. The product is of significant value and quality. I could come down to $200, which I think is quite reasonable considering what you're getting. How does that sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $70, but I'm still quite a bit away from what I can accept for this product. Given its quality and value, I could come down to $175, which is significantly lower than my initial price. This is a substantial discount from my original asking price. Would this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, Alice is showing a pattern of extremely slow concessions.  Her price drops are not significant enough to warrant further negotiation when I have a guaranteed option at $80."
