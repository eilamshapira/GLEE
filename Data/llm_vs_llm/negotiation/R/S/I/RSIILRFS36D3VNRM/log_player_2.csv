"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's initial offer of $95 is close to my maximum budget of $100, but still higher than I'd like to pay, I'll choose to reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try and negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I don't know Alice's minimum price, I'll start with a price that is slightly lower than her initial offer.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $88? It's still a great price considering the value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's new offer of $88 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but it's getting closer to my target price. Since I know that Alice is willing to sell the product for at least $80 (as that's the value it holds to her), I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $88, and I know she's willing to sell for at least $80, I'll try to meet her halfway between her last offer and my previous offer.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $84. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 84}"
