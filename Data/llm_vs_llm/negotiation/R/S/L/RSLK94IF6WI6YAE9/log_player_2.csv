Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly unique product. This is something that could be a game-changer for you.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $2000000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}"
