Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $13500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

I will reject Bob's offer of $9,000 and make a counteroffer. Since the product is worth $12,000 to me and Bob is willing to pay up to $10,000, I believe there is still room for negotiation.

Here's my counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value. Let me know if this works for you!"", ""product_price"": 11500}"
