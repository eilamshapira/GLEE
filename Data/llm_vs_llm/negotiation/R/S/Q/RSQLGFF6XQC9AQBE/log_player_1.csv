Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about the optimal price to offer Bob.

Given that:
1. The product is worth $10,000 to Bob
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $10,000
3. Bob can only accept or reject my offer

I should offer Bob a price slightly above $10,000 since I have nothing to lose (I can always sell to John) and something to potentially gain if Bob accepts.
