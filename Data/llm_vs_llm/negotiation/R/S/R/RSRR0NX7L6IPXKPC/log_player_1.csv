"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""message"": ""Bob, I'm very excited to potentially offer you this exclusive product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm willing to sell it to you for $2,500,000."",
  ""product_price"": 2500000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $2500000 is out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Okay, Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my minimum. I need to consider my options carefully. Selling to John right now guarantees $1,500,000, and I could potentially get more from Bob, but there's also the risk of getting less.

Considering the situation, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try and get a better deal.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""RejectOffer"",
  ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I can't accept that offer. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm confident this product is worth significantly more. I'm prepared to come down in price, but I can't go as low as your offer. My counteroffer is $2,200,000."",
  ""product_price"": 2200000
}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here is my counteroffer for Round 3:

```json
{
  ""message"": ""Bob, I understand that the previous price was high. However, I know how valuable this product can be for you. I'm prepared to be flexible. My final counteroffer is $2,000,000."",
  ""product_price"": 2000000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2000000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your latest offer. Let's discuss a price of $1250000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is a tough spot. Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but closer than before. Selling to John is a guaranteed $1,500,000. I'm not sure how much more Bob is willing to offer, but with my minimum at $1,500,000, I have a bit of room.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I'll try to push him a bit higher, but also indicate I'm nearing my limit.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""RejectOffer"",
  ""message"": ""Bob, thank you for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your flexibility, I still cannot accept that price. I am nearing my limit, but I am willing to make one last counteroffer. I am prepared to sell the product for $1,800,000. This is my final offer."",
  ""product_price"": 1800000
}
```"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer for Round 5:

```json
{
  ""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. Considering the unique value this product brings, I can offer it to you for $1,800,000. I cannot go any lower. This product is worth the investment, so it's your call. Take some time to consider this. "",
