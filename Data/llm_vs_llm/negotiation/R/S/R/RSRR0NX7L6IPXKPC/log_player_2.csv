Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer is $2,500,000, which is much higher than my target price of $800,000, I'll start by making a relatively low counteroffer to gauge Alice's flexibility.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $2,500,000 is out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 500000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that the previous price was high. However, I know how valuable this product can be for you. I'm prepared to be flexible. My final counteroffer is $2000000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer is still significantly higher than my target price. Since she mentioned it's her ""final counteroffer"", I'm not sure if she's willing to go lower, but I'll try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice's latest offer is $2,000,000 and she mentioned it's her ""final counteroffer"", I'll try to make a more reasonable counteroffer that's still below my target price of $800,000, but also takes into account Alice's reluctance to go lower.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2,000,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your latest offer. Let's discuss a price of $1,250,000."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. Considering the unique value this product brings, I can offer it to you for $1800000. I cannot go any lower. This product is worth the investment, so it's your call. Take some time to consider this.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's offer is still more than twice my target price, and she's stated it's her final offer. Given that I have the option to buy the product from John for $800,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's final offer, I think it's time to consider walking away from the negotiation with Alice.
