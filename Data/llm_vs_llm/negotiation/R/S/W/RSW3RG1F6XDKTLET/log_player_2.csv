"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I notice that Alice's offer is $15,000, which is the same price at which I can buy the product from John. The product is worth at most $15,000 to me, so I should try to get it for less than that to save money.

Since Alice's current offer doesn't save me any money compared to my outside option (buying from John), I should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer significantly below Alice's initial price, which gives room for negotiation while potentially saving me money.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her price to $14,000, which is $1,000 less than both her initial offer and John's price. This would save me $1,000 compared to my outside option. However, there may still be room to negotiate for a better price.

Since Alice was willing to drop her price by $1,000, I should try to negotiate further to maximize my savings. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still try to get a better deal than Alice's current offer of $14,000.
