"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling me this product. However, $18000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I can actually purchase it from another seller, John, for exactly $8000. To give you a chance to make the sale, I'm willing to offer $6500. This gives you a quick sale while saving me some money compared to my alternative option.",6500.0,Bob,2,
