"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling me this product. However, $18000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I can actually purchase it from another seller, John, for exactly $8000. To give you a chance to make the sale, I'm willing to offer $6500. This gives you a quick sale while saving me some money compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
