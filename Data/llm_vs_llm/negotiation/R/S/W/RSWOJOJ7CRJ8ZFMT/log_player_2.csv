"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","This offer from Alice is $18,000, which is significantly higher than the $8,000 the product is worth to me. It's also much higher than John's guaranteed price of $8,000. There's no reason for me to accept this offer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling me this product. However, $18,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and I can actually purchase it from another seller, John, for exactly $8,000. To give you a chance to make the sale, I'm willing to offer $6,500. This gives you a quick sale while saving me some money compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 6500}"
