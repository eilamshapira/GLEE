Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

My reasoning is this:

*   **Anchoring High:** I'm starting with a price significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000). This sets a high anchor for the negotiation and gives me room to come down later.
*   **Potential Upside:** I don't know Bob's valuation. He might be willing to pay a premium for the product.
*   **Risk Mitigation:** I know John is waiting in the wings with $800,000. If Bob is truly unwilling to meet me even close to that, I can walk away.
*   **Negotiation Space:** This price allows for several rounds of negotiation without immediately revealing my bottom line. It's a starting point, not a final demand."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Okay, here's my response:

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

My reasoning:

*   $900,000 is a decent offer, but I still believe I can get more. It's significantly above my minimum, but I want to explore the possibility of extracting more value from Bob.
*   John is a fallback. I can always sell to him for $800,000, but I want to see if Bob is willing to budge further.
*   Negotiation is a process. It's unlikely that the first counteroffer will be the best Bob can do.
*   It's crucial to avoid accepting the first counteroffer unless it's surprisingly good. This trains the buyer to expect further concessions.

Now, I need to formulate my counteroffer for the next round. I will do that in the next turn."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob for round 2:

```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

Reasoning:

*   **Not too much of a drop:** I'm reducing the price by $100,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate. A large drop might signal weakness.
*   **Still above a million:** Maintaining a price above a million keeps the perceived value of the product high.
*   **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer tests Bob's true interest. If he comes up significantly from $900,000, I know he values the product highly. If he barely budges, I'll need to reconsider my strategy.
*   **John is still waiting:** I keep John's $800,000 offer in mind as my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

My reasoning:

*   **Positive Trend, but Not Enough:** Bob increased his offer by $50,000. This indicates he *does* have more to give. However, $950,000 still feels like I'm leaving money on the table.
*   **Still Room to Negotiate:** Given that Bob is inching upward, I believe another round of negotiation could push him closer to a price I'm happier with.
*   **John Remains My Baseline:** $800,000 is my safety net, and I'm still well above that.
*   **Avoiding Early Concessions:** Accepting $950,000 now might make me regret not pushing harder later.

I'll formulate my counteroffer for the next round now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob for round 3:

```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

Reasoning:

*   **Smaller Increment:** I'm only dropping the price by $50,000 this time. This signals that I'm getting closer to my bottom line, and Bob will need to make a more significant move.
*   **Psychological Threshold:** $1,050,000 is still above the $1 million mark, which can have a psychological impact on Bob. It suggests the product is of very high value.
*   **Testing Bob's Resolve:** This offer will test how serious Bob is about acquiring the product. If he's truly interested, he'll need to come up considerably.
*   **Maintaining Control:** I'm still well above my walk-away price of $800,000.

Let's see how Bob responds to this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reasoning:

*   **Incremental Increase:** Bob only increased his offer by $25,000. This suggests he might be close to his maximum, but I'm still not convinced. It also suggests he's anchoring on the previous offer, rather than the inherent value.
*   **Below $1 Million:** I'm hesitant to go below the $1 million threshold if I can avoid it.
*   **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential upside of another round still outweighs the risk of losing the deal, given John's offer of $800,000. I believe I can squeeze out a bit more.
*   **One More Push:** I want to make one more attempt to reach a higher price point.

I'll prepare my next counteroffer now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

Reasoning:

*   **Meeting in the Middle (Slightly):** This offer splits the difference somewhat between my last offer ($1,050,000) and his ($975,000), but it leans slightly in my favor. It is a calculated risk.
*   **Psychological Play:** By dropping below the $1,050,000 mark but staying above $1,000,000, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to also move more significantly.
*   **Testing the Limit:** I'm testing if $1,000,000 is some kind of mental barrier for Bob.
*   **Still Safe:** I'm still a good distance from the $800,000 I'm guaranteed with John.

Let's see how Bob reacts. This could be the final push needed. If Bob doesn't move much from here, I may need to seriously consider accepting his next offer or walking away."
