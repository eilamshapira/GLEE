Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have this amazing product I think you'd really love. I'm asking $250 for it."", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $250 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Given Bob's counteroffer of $80, I have a few options. I can't accept that, as I need at least $150. I could also sell to John for $150, but I think I can get more from Bob.

Therefore, I will **reject** Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the interest, Bob. I understand your budget. However, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $220?"", ""product_price"": 220}"
