"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer compared to what the product is worth to me and the alternative option of buying from John.

Alice's offer is $2,500,000, which exceeds the $1,500,000 maximum value of the product to me. Furthermore, I can buy the same product from John for exactly $1,500,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since Alice's price is significantly higher than my valuation and higher than John's price, it makes the most economic sense to go with option 3.
