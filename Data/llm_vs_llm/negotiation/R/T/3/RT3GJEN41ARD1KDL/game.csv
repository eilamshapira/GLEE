"Hi Bob, thank you for getting back to me. I understand that the initial price might be a bit high for you. However, I believe the value of the product is well worth it. I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I hope we can make a deal at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $1200000 is still beyond what I can justify spending. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $700000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
