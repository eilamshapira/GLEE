Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [Product Name].  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This is a chance to acquire something truly unique."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer that's significantly closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While my initial offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, keeping me well above my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** My message emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob to accept the high price. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still offering Bob a price that reflects the product's worth to him."
