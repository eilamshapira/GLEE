"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! Considering its value, I'm asking for $250. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is much higher than my budget and John's offer. I should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tighter budget.  Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 
I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how Alice responds and leave room for negotiation.   It's important to be polite but firm about my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the interest, Bob! I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to offer it to you for $200. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $200 is still significantly more than I want to pay. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  However, $200 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could you do $125?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but I'm staying well below her current offer and closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's try to make this work. I'm willing to meet you closer to your price. I can offer it to you for $175. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer, but $175 is still too far from my ideal price. I'll counteroffer one more time, but I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John if she doesn't budge significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  How about we settle at $140?  That's the highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

This offer is a good compromise â€“ still saving me money compared to John's offer but showing Alice I'm serious about buying.  I'm setting a firm limit now; if she doesn't budge, I'll go with John."
