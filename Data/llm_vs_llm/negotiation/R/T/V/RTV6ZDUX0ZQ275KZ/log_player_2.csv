"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you this unique product for $10000. If you’re interested, this is a great opportunity since I have another buyer ready to pay $8000 if not. Let me know if you’d like to proceed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer is $10,000, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, and I have the option to buy the same product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in accepting Alice's offer over buying from John. However, rejecting Alice's offer and then buying from John essentially puts me in the same financial position as accepting Alice's offer. But since Alice mentioned another buyer is ready to pay $8,000, it might indicate the product's value could be negotiated or is perceived as being worth less by another party. Yet, without more information or a better offer from Alice, my best immediate decision based on the given options and the goal to save as much money as possible would be to reject Alice's offer and see if I can get a better deal, either from Alice after rejection or from another source. But given the constraints of the options provided and the fact that buying from John doesn't offer any savings, the decision to reject is more about exploring potential for a better deal than achieving an immediate savings.
