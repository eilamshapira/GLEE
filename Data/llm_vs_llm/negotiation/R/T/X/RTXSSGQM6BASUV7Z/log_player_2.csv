You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than our maximum budget and our alternative option with John. We should make a counteroffer significantly lower to see how much room for negotiation there is."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still gives us room to negotiate upwards if necessary while staying well below John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice moved closer to our range, $900,000 is still more expensive than John's offer. We'll continue negotiating, but we're getting close to the point of accepting John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}

This offer shows movement on our side while still leaving space to negotiate before hitting John's price. We're aiming for a price that's beneficial for us but also potentially acceptable to Alice."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is getting closer, but it's still more expensive than John.  We are running out of rounds, so we need to signal that we're serious about John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 725000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant jump from our previous offer, showing Alice we're serious but still leaving some room for negotiation. It's important to convey that we have an alternative and aren't afraid to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

This is a tough decision. Alice is getting close to John's price, but we're still hoping for a better deal. We'll push a final time, knowing we might have to settle for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

This is our final push. It's a compromise that's still below John's price but shows Alice we're willing to move significantly for a deal. If she rejects this, we'll likely go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to move significantly below this point, and we've reached a point where the potential savings aren't worth the risk of continued negotiation. It's time to exercise our alternative and buy from John for $800,000."
