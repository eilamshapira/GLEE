"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $20000. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I see that Alice is offering the product for $20,000, which is actually above my maximum value of $15,000. Since I know I can buy the same product from John for exactly $15,000, there's no reason for me to accept Alice's current offer or continue negotiating to a price that likely won't drop below what John is offering.
