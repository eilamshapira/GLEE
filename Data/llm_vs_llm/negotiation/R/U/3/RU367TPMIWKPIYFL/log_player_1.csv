Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my offer to Bob. The product is worth at least $120 to me, and if Bob rejects my offer, I can sell it to John for $120. However, Bob values the product at only $100, which means he won't accept any offer above that amount.

Since Bob won't pay more than $100, and I can guarantee $120 from John, the rational choice is to make an offer that Bob will reject so I can sell to John instead.
