"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $1600000. Let me know if you're interested at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since the offered price of $1,600,000 is higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,200,000), it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price. Buying from John for $1,200,000 is an option, but first, I'd like to see if Alice can offer a more competitive price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. Since I'm not willing to pay more than $1,200,000, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but not so low that it's unreasonable.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
