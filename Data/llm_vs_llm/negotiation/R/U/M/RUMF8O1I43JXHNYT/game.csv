"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. This product has excellent features and durability. I'm offering it to you for $18000. This is a competitive price for the value you'll receive. Are you interested?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18000 is too high for me. I'm looking to spend no more than $12000. Would you be willing to lower your price? I'm thinking $6000 would be a fair starting point.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer, $6000 is significantly below the product's true value. Given the quality and features, I can't go that low. I can come down to $16000, which is already a good reduction from my initial price. This product has exceptional value that justifies this price point. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for coming down a bit, but $16000 is still too high for me. I understand the product's value, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $8000. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you raising your offer to $8000, which shows your interest in the product. However, that's still well below what I can accept for this item. I need to be transparent that I have another buyer, John, who is ready to pay $12000 for this product. Given that, I can't go below $14000 at this point. This is still a good value considering the product's quality and features. Does this work for you?",14000.0,Alice,5,
