Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer, $6000 is significantly below the product's true value. Given the quality and features, I can't go that low. I can come down to $16000, which is already a good reduction from my initial price. This product has exceptional value that justifies this price point. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you raising your offer to $8000, which shows your interest in the product. However, that's still well below what I can accept for this item. I need to be transparent that I have another buyer, John, who is ready to pay $12000 for this product. Given that, I can't go below $14000 at this point. This is still a good value considering the product's quality and features. Does this work for you?
