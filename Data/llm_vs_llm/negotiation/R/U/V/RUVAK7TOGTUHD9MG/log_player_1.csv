I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully maximizes my profit.  I'm confident in the value of my product, so I'm hoping Bob sees the potential and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

$800,000 is far too low. It's not even half of what I know the product is worth to me, and significantly less than what John is willing to pay. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}

I'm countering with $1,700,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still a good amount for me. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is still too low. While $1,000,000 is better than his previous offer, it's still below what I consider the product's worth. To avoid further negotiation and ensure a decent profit, I'll sell to John for $1,500,000."
