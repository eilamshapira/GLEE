Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this situation. Given that:
1. The product is worth $800,000 to Bob
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer of $1,200,000 from John
3. I shouldn't accept anything less than $1,200,000

I'll start with a high offer to see if Bob might be willing to pay more than his apparent value, though I expect a counteroffer.
