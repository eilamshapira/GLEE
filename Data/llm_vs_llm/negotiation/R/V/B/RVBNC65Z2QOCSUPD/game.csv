"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1150000 is a bit steep. Given the market conditions and considering the product's value, I can offer $1050000. This represents a solid $50000 profit margin for you while being a fair price for me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I also know the immense value this product holds for you. While I appreciate your offer of $1050000, I'm still firm on securing a price closer to its inherent worth. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $1125000.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for moving on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel we can find a more balanced middle ground. I can offer $1080000, which gives you a substantial profit while being more aligned with my budget constraints.",1080000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I recognize your budget considerations, but I also need to ensure a fair return that reflects the product's true value. Let's try this: I can come down to $1110000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",1110000.0,Alice,5,
