"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer, considering the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob and I want to maximize my profit while leaving some room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 1,400,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","While $1,300,000 is a good offer and significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000), I believe there might still be room for negotiation since it's only round 2 and Bob's first counter shows he's willing to pay a substantial amount. I'll reject this offer and make a counter.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still try to get a higher price than Bob's last offer.

{""product_price"": 1,350,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob is gradually decreasing his offers ($1,300,000 → $1,250,000), but we're still in a good negotiating position as his offer is well above John's price. However, we're approaching the middle rounds, and I want to ensure we don't risk losing the better deal. Since Bob's current offer is still significantly higher than John's $1,000,000, I'll continue negotiating with one more counter.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since we're now at round 5 (halfway through), I'll reduce my asking price to show more flexibility while still aiming for a better price than Bob's last offer.

{""product_price"": 1,285,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob continues to decrease his offers ($1,300,000 → $1,250,000 → $1,200,000), and we're now in round 6 of 10. While his offer is still significantly better than John's $1,000,000, the downward trend and the limited remaining rounds suggest we should secure this deal rather than risk further decline. $1,200,000 represents a good profit above my minimum price, and it's a reasonable split of the surplus value between us.
