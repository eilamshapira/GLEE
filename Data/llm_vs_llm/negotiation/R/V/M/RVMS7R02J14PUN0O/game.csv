"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. The product sounds interesting. However, considering I can buy a similar product elsewhere for $10000, I'm hoping for a slightly better price. Would you consider selling it to me for $8500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I understand your position, $8500 is lower than what I can accept given the product's value. I can offer it to you for $9000, which is still a significant discount from the market price of $10000.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks, Alice. I understand your position. How about $8750? That's a bit closer to your asking price while still being a good value for me.",8750.0,Bob,4,
