"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $9500. This price reflects the product's worth while still providing you with good value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I should reject Alice's offer. It's higher than what the product is worth to Alice ($8,000), and I'm willing to pay up to $10,000. I should try to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, I'll make a counteroffer. I want to try to get the price as low as possible while still seeming reasonable.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. The product sounds interesting. However, considering I can buy a similar product elsewhere for $10,000, I'm hoping for a slightly better price. Would you consider selling it to me for $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I understand your position, $8500 is lower than what I can accept given the product's value. I can offer it to you for $9000, which is still a significant discount from the market price of $10000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Okay, Alice is still above my ideal price, but closer. I could try to negotiate further, but I also don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Buying from John is a last resort. I'll reject and counteroffer one more time, but I'll have to be a bit more flexible.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alright, let's try this one more time.

{""message"": ""Thanks, Alice. I understand your position. How about $8750? That's a bit closer to your asking price while still being a good value for me."", ""product_price"": 8750}"
