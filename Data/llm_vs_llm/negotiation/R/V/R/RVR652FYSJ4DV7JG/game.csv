"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to spend no more than $800000. I believe this price point reflects the value it brings to me and would appreciate your consideration.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must say that $800000 is a bit lower than I was expecting, considering the product's value. I'm willing to make a compromise and lower my initial price. I'm offering the product to you for $1150000, which I believe is a more reasonable price point for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice. However, I need to stick to my budget constraints. I'm willing to raise my offer to $900000. I believe this price recognizes the product's value while also being a good deal for both parties.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price. However, I still believe that $900000 doesn't fully reflect the product's value. I'm willing to make another compromise and lower my price further. I'm offering the product to you for $1075000, which I believe is a more reasonable price point for both of us. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and finalize the deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I still believe that $950000 doesn't fully reflect the product's value. I'm willing to make another compromise and lower my price further. I'm offering the product to you for $1050000, which I believe is a more reasonable price point for both of us. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
