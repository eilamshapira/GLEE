Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $1,250,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth and I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to spend no more than $800000. I believe this price point reflects the value it brings to me and would appreciate your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me ($1,200,000) and even lower than its worth to Bob ($1,000,000), I will reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate and try to reach a better price. Selling to John is an option, but I want to try to get a better deal with Bob first."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must say that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was expecting, considering the product's value. I'm willing to make a compromise and lower my initial price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,150,000, which I believe is a more reasonable price point for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Bob's new offer of $900,000 is still lower than the product's worth to me ($1,200,000) and its worth to Bob ($1,000,000). While Bob has increased his offer, it's not enough to meet my expectations. I will reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer. I still have 6 rounds left to negotiate and try to reach a better price. Selling to John is still an option, but I want to try to get a better deal with Bob first."
