"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I cannot accept $11000 as that's below my minimum threshold. The product has significant value, and I'm already offering it below market rate. I can come down to $13800, which is a fair discount from my initial offer while reflecting the product's true value.",13800.0,Alice,3,
