"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to make a decision based on the information given.

Alice offers the product for $15,000, but the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me. John is willing to sell the same product for $10,000.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and Alice's offer exceeds the product's worth to me, the rational choice is to buy from John at $10,000.
