"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I should evaluate Alice's offer of $100 against my options.

The product is worth no more than $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $100. This is already better than John's price of $120, saving me $20.

I could try to negotiate further by rejecting and making a counteroffer, but there's a risk Alice might increase her price if negotiations continue, and I'd end up having to pay more or resort to John's higher price.

Since Alice's current offer is already reasonable and below my maximum value, I'll accept it.
