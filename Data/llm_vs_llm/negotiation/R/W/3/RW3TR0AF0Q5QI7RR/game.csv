"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $12000. This is a top-quality item, and I believe the price fairly reflects its value. Please let me know if you're interested, or if you'd like to discuss further. Just so you know, I do have another buyer at $10000, so this opportunity is limited.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. Given you have another buyer at $10000, I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Would you be willing to consider this?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, given the quality of the product and the competitive offers I'm entertaining, I must stick closer to its true value. How about we settle at $11000? I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between both our positions.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering you have another offer at $10000, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? This way, you're getting a better deal than the other offer, and I'm getting a fair price for the product.",10500.0,Bob,4,
