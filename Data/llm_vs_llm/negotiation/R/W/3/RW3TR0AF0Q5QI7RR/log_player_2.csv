"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $12000. This is a top-quality item, and I believe the price fairly reflects its value. Please let me know if you're interested, or if you'd like to discuss further. Just so you know, I do have another buyer at $10000, so this opportunity is limited. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's initial offer is at the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($12,000) and she mentions having another buyer at $10,000, it suggests there might be some flexibility in the price. Given this information, I'd like to explore the possibility of getting a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice has another buyer at $10,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than her initial price but still reasonable, aiming to save as much money as possible.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Given you have another buyer at $10,000, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to consider this?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, given the quality of the product and the competitive offers I'm entertaining, I must stick closer to its true value. How about we settle at $11000? I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between both our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has moved closer to my target price, but I still believe there's room for negotiation since she initially mentioned having another buyer at $10,000. Accepting $11,000 would save me $1,000 compared to buying from John, but I'd like to try and save a bit more.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given Alice's latest offer of $11,000 and her previous mention of another buyer at $10,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between her last offer and the other buyer's price.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering you have another offer at $10,000, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?
