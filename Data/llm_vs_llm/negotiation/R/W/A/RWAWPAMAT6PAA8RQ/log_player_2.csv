"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $150. It's a great value and I think you'll be very satisfied with it. Are you interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $80 to me
2. John is willing to sell it for $80
3. Alice's offer of $150 is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price

Alice's offer of $150 is clearly not a good deal. Since I can get the same product from John for $80, and Alice's price is almost double that amount, there's no reason to accept this offer.

I could try to negotiate with Alice by rejecting and making a counteroffer, but since I already have a guaranteed option to buy at $80 (which is my maximum value), it would be most rational to take the sure deal with John.
