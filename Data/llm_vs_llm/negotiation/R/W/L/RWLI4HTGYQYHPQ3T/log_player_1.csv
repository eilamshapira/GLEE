Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $125 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($120) but lower than what I initially hoped for, and considering I have the option to sell to John for $120, I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my initial offer or at least ensure I get more than John's offer.

My decision is to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. However, the format requires a specific response for the decision made in this round, which is rejecting Bob's offer. The next step will be making a counteroffer, but for now:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Considering Bob's offer was $125, and knowing the product is worth $150 to him, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my initial offer but still closer to what I believe the product is worth to Bob, trying to meet in the middle.
