"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, the market price for this product is much lower than $1200000. I am willing to pay $600000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $600000 is significantly below the product's value. The product is worth at least $800000 to me, and I know its market value justifies a higher price. I can come down to $1000000, which is still an excellent value considering the product's quality and capabilities. I should mention that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $800000, but I'm giving you priority as I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
