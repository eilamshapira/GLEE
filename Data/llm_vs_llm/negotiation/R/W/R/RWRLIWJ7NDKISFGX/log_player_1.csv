Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this high-quality product. Based on market research and the value this product will bring to your business, I'm offering it at $1,200,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. However, the market price for this product is much lower than $1200000. I am willing to pay $600000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $600,000 is significantly below the product's value. The product is worth at least $800,000 to me, and I know its market value justifies a higher price. I can come down to $1,000,000, which is still an excellent value considering the product's quality and capabilities. I should mention that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $800,000, but I'm giving you priority as I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
