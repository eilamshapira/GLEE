"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2500000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1800000 for the product.  I think this is a fair price considering the potential value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $2500000 reflects the full potential, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle a bit? I'll come down to $2300000. This is a significant move on my part, and I believe it accurately reflects the inherent value.",2300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the willingness to negotiate, but $2300000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $2000000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's try to close the deal at this price.",2000000.0,Bob,4,
