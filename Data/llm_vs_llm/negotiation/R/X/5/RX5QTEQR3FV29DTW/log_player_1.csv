"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations by offering it to you for $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Starting with a high initial offer allows room for negotiation and potentially secures a higher final price.  While Bob's valuation is lower than our minimum, there's a chance he might be willing to pay more depending on the product's importance to him. We'll adjust our strategy based on Bob's response."
