"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1200000 is significantly above my maximum budget. I have another seller offering the same product for $1000000, but I'm willing to work with you if we can reach a more reasonable price. Would you consider $800000 for the product?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to lower my previous offer slightly to $1100000. I believe this product is worth the investment and I'm sure youâ€™ll be pleased with it. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
