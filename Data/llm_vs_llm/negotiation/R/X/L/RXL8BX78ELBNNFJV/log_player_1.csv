Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider what price to offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price, I should set a price higher than $15,000 when offering to Bob.

While I don't know how much Bob values the product, I should aim for a reasonable markup that gives me a good profit while still being potentially acceptable to Bob.
