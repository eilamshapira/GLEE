"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is reasonable and within my budget. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a lower offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to meet Alice halfway between my previous offer and her new offer. Since she came down to $130, I'll increase my offer to $110, which is still within my budget of $120.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my range. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $110. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 110}"
