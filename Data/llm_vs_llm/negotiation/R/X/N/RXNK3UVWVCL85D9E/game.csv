"Hello Bob, I hope you're doing well. I'm offering our premium product for sale. Given its quality and features, I'm setting the price at $12500. This represents excellent value considering the product's capabilities and market position. I look forward to hearing your thoughts.",12500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. Considering its market value, I'm willing to offer $8500 for the product. This price would allow us both to make a fair deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, I need to consider the true value of this product. The $8500 you're offering is below what I can accept, as the product is worth at least $10000 to me based on its quality and market value. I'd be willing to come down to $11000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price still provides you with excellent value for a premium product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $9500, which reflects a fair compromise and would allow us to reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,
