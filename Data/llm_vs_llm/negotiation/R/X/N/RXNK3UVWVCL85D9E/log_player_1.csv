Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. Considering its market value, I'm willing to offer $8500 for the product. This price would allow us both to make a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, I need to consider the true value of this product. The $8,500 you're offering is below what I can accept, as the product is worth at least $10,000 to me based on its quality and market value. I'd be willing to come down to $11,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price still provides you with excellent value for a premium product.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $9500, which reflects a fair compromise and would allow us to reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think.
