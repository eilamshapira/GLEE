Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, I need to consider the true value of this product. The $8500 you're offering is below what I can accept, as the product is worth at least $10000 to me based on its quality and market value. I'd be willing to come down to $11000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price still provides you with excellent value for a premium product. What do you think?
