"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. There's no immediate benefit to accepting.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a better price from Alice or, if negotiations stall, you have the backup option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial price. It's a reasonable starting point, reflecting that you're willing to pay something but also want a good deal.  This will likely trigger a counter-offer from Alice, giving you more information about her price flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is a good deal for you, as it's $20 less than what you'd pay John. While you might be able to get a slightly lower price by continuing to negotiate, the risk is that Alice will reject your counteroffer again, and you'll be forced to pay John's higher price. Accepting Alice's offer guarantees you a good deal with minimal risk."
