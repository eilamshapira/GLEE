"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product to me, but $9500 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it, which is still a fair price considering the value you're getting for it.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I understand your budget concerns. However, $8500 is lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $9200. This is my best offer considering the product's exceptional quality and the value it brings.",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9200 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9000? I'm sure we can both be happy with this price.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm very close to my bottom line, but I value this potential deal with you. How about $9100? This is my absolute lowest price. I won't be able to go any lower.",9100.0,Alice,5,
