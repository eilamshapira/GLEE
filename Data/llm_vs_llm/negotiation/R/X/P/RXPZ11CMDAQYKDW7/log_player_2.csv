"Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Looking at the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: Pay $999,999
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John: Pay $1,000,000

Alice's offer is $999,999, which is just $1 less than John's price of $1,000,000. The product is worth up to $1,000,000 to me, so either option is within my acceptable range.

Since Alice's offer saves me $1 compared to John's price, and my goal is to save as much money as possible while still getting the product, I should accept Alice's offer.
