"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is above my budget. I can offer $7000 for the product.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12000 might be out of your budget, but $7000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I can offer you a better price, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal for the product's value.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want a fair deal, so how about $7500? I think that brings us closer to a middle ground.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $7500. However, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. Considering the product's value and our ongoing negotiation, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. How about we meet at $9500?",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you adjusting your offer. To be fair to both of us, how about $8000? I believe that is a reasonable price for both sides.",8000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8000. I understand that we're getting closer, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Considering your last offer and the product's value, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I can offer the product to you for $9000. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, given the product's worth.",9000.0,Alice,7,
