Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to sell it to you at a competitive price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is above my budget. I can offer $7000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my target price. $7,000 is still too low for me, and I believe I can get a better deal either from Bob or from selling to John later if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be out of your budget, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I can offer you a better price, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal for the product's value."", ""product_price"": 10000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a fair deal, so how about $7500? I think that brings us closer to a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

$7,500 is still below my minimum threshold of $10,000, and I believe I can get a better offer from Bob or sell it to John for the price I'm looking for. I'll make another counteroffer to see if Bob is willing to meet me closer to my target price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $7,500. However, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. Considering the product's value and our ongoing negotiation, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. How about we meet at $9,500?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you adjusting your offer. To be fair to both of us, how about $8000? I believe that is a reasonable price for both sides. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

$8,000 is still below my target price, and since I know the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, I suspect he might be willing to go a bit higher. I'll make another counteroffer to try and close the deal at a price closer to what I'm aiming for."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,000. I understand that we're getting closer, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Considering your last offer and the product's value, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I can offer the product to you for $9,000. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, given the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
