"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $180. This is a fair price considering its features and benefits. Would you like to purchase it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $150
2. Alice is offering the product for $180
3. John is willing to sell it for $150

Since Alice's offer ($180) is above my maximum value ($150), and John is offering exactly what I value the product at, it makes more sense to buy from John. There's no reason to pay $30 more for the same product.
