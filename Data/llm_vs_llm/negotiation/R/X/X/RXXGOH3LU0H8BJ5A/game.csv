Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe has great value. I am offering it to you for $1500000. Let me know what you think!,1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be transparent that $1500000 is beyond my budget. I actually have another seller, John, who's offering the same product for $1200000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product. This would save me some money compared to John's offer while still providing you with a substantial sum. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget concerns, I cannot accept $1000000. How about we meet halfway and settle on a price of $1200000? I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
