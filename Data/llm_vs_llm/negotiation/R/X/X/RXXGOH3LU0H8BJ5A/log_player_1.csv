Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be transparent that $1500000 is beyond my budget. I actually have another seller, John, who's offering the same product for $1200000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product. This would save me some money compared to John's offer while still providing you with a substantial sum. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
