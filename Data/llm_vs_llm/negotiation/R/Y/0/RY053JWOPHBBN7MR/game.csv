"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is well above my budget for this product. I can get a similar product from another seller for $120. But I'd like to work with you - would you consider selling it for $100? This would help me stay within my budget while still giving you a fair return.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, I'm afraid $100 is too low for me as this product is worth at least $150 to me. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $150 for it. However, since we're already in discussion, I can offer it to you for $145, which is still below my minimum acceptable value but represents a significant discount from my initial offer. Would this work for you?",145.0,Alice,3,
