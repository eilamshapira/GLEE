Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is well above my budget for this product. I can get a similar product from another seller for $120. But I'd like to work with you - would you consider selling it for $100? This would help me stay within my budget while still giving you a fair return. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, I'm afraid $100 is too low for me as this product is worth at least $150 to me. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $150 for it. However, since we're already in discussion, I can offer it to you for $145, which is still below my minimum acceptable value but represents a significant discount from my initial offer. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 145}"
