Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, I'm afraid $100 is too low for me as this product is worth at least $150 to me. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $150 for it. However, since we're already in discussion, I can offer it to you for $145, which is still below my minimum acceptable value but represents a significant discount from my initial offer. Would this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145.
