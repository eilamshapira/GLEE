"Hello Bob, I have this excellent product that I believe would be very valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $14000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe the product is valuable, but the price of $14000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000, considering the product's worth and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $12000, but I need to get a better return on this product. I can come down from my initial price, but $13000 would be a more reasonable price. This still gives you $2000 in value while being fair to both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your new price. I'd like to propose a price of $12500. This way, we can both get a fair deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
