"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have this excellent product that I believe would be very valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe the product is valuable, but the price of $14000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000, considering the product's worth and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, there's still room for negotiation since I know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $12,000, but I need to get a better return on this product. I can come down from my initial price, but $13,000 would be a more reasonable price. This still gives you $2,000 in value while being fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your new price. I'd like to propose a price of $12500. This way, we can both get a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $12,500. This is a reasonable compromise that gives me a good profit ($2,500 above my minimum) while also leaving value for Bob ($2,500 below his maximum value). Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal, and it's significantly better than selling to John for $10,000."
