"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since the product is only worth $100 to me and John is willing to sell it for $100, I would never accept an offer higher than $100. Alice's offer of $150 is well above my maximum value, so I'll reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 70}

I'll start with a relatively low offer of $70. This gives room for negotiation while still being a reasonable price. If Alice's cost is low enough, she might accept this offer or make a counteroffer closer to my maximum of $100. If she counters with a price above $100, I can always fall back on John's offer of $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $130 is still well above both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). Since I have several rounds left and can always fall back on John's offer, I'll reject this offer and try another counteroffer. Alice has moved down from $150 to $130, showing some flexibility, so there might be room for further negotiation to reach a price below $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 85}

I'll increase my previous offer to $85. This shows I'm willing to move up from my initial offer of $70, but still keeps the price well below my maximum value of $100. Since Alice has shown willingness to reduce her price (from $150 to $130), this moderate increase in my offer might encourage her to continue negotiating downward. If she still doesn't accept, I still have several rounds left and can always buy from John at $100 if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice continues to lower her price (from $150 to $130 to $120), but it's still above both my maximum value and John's price of $100. Since she's showing a pattern of reducing her price, I'll reject and make another counteroffer. There's no reason to accept a price above $100 when I have John's offer as a guaranteed backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 90}

I'll increase my offer to $90. Alice has been consistently lowering her price ($150 -> $130 -> $120), showing she's willing to negotiate. By raising my offer to $90, I'm showing continued good faith in the negotiation while still staying safely below my maximum value of $100. If Alice doesn't accept this offer, I still have several rounds left and can always take John's offer of $100 as a last resort."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer ($110) is still above John's price ($100)
2. While Alice has been gradually lowering her price ($150 -> $130 -> $120 -> $110), the rate of decrease suggests she might not go below $100
3. Even if she does eventually go below $100, the potential savings might only be a few dollars
4. We've already used 7 rounds, and there's a risk of running out of rounds before reaching a better deal
5. John's offer of $100 matches my maximum value, making it a safe and reasonable choice

It's better to secure the deal at $100 now rather than risk further negotiations that might not lead to a better outcome."
