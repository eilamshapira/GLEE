"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I can purchase this same product from John for $1000000, so your price doesn't provide me any savings. Given that the product is worth less to you, I'd like to propose $850000 for the product, which would give us both value in this transaction. This would save me money while still providing you with a meaningful profit above your valuation. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, considering the quality and unique value of the product, I can only part with it at $900000. This price still offers you significant value while ensuring that I get my due return. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,3,
