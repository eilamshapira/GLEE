Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I can purchase this same product from John for $1000000, so your price doesn't provide me any savings. Given that the product is worth less to you, I'd like to propose $850000 for the product, which would give us both value in this transaction. This would save me money while still providing you with a meaningful profit above your valuation. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
