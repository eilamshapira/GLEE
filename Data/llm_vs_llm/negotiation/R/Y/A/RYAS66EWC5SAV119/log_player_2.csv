"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you the product for $1000000. Let me know if you’re interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to consider my options carefully. Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is exactly the same price as John's offer and the maximum amount it's worth to me. Since Alice's initial offer shows no savings compared to my alternative option, I should negotiate to try to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I can purchase this same product from John for $1,000,000, so your price doesn't provide me any savings. Given that the product is worth less to you, I'd like to propose $850,000 for the product, which would give us both value in this transaction. This would save me money while still providing you with a meaningful profit above your valuation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, considering the quality and unique value of the product, I can only part with it at $900000. This price still offers you significant value while ensuring that I get my due return. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has countered with $900,000, which is $100,000 less than John's price of $1,000,000. This is a significant improvement and would save me money compared to my alternative option. Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, she's still making a $100,000 profit, and I'm getting a $100,000 discount compared to John's price. This seems like a reasonable deal that benefits both of us.
