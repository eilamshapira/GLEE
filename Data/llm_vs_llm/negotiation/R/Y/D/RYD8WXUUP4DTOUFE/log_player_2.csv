"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $18000. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer of $18,000 is above my budget of $15,000, I will reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. This will give us room to negotiate and potentially find a mutually acceptable price.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $12,000."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $12000 is a bit lower than I'm looking for. Let's meet in the middle at $15000. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's new offer of $15,000 is exactly at my budget limit, and I also have the option to buy the product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in continuing to negotiate with Alice. In this case, I might as well buy the product from John, as it eliminates the risk of further negotiation and potential price increases.
