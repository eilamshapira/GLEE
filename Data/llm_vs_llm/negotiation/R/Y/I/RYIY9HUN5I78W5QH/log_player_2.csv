"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'm evaluating the options:

Alice offers the product for $1,500,000, which is equal to Alice's valuation but exceeds my maximum value of $1,200,000.

John (though misspelled as ""Jhon"" in the options) is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is equal to my maximum valuation.

If I buy from Alice at $1,500,000, I'd be paying $300,000 more than the product is worth to me.

The rational choice is to decline Alice's offer and purchase from John.
