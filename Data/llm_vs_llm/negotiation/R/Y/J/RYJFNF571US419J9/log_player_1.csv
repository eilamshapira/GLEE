Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Considering my minimum acceptable price is $800,000 and Bob is offering that, I should accept to avoid losing the deal.
