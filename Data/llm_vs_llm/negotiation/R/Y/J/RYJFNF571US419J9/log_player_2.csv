"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $950,000, which is $50,000 less than John's price of $1,000,000. While this saves me some money compared to buying from John, I should try to negotiate a better deal with Alice, as the product is worth up to $1,000,000 to me.

It makes sense to reject Alice's initial offer and make a counteroffer. If Alice rejects my counteroffer, I can still continue negotiating, and at any point, I can fall back to buying from John if needed.
