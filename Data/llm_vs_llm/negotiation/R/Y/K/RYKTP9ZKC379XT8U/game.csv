"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $75 is too low for this product given its value. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $125, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $125 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $90? This is a fair price considering my budget constraints. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,4,
