Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product to offer you. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $150. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer because:
1. Bob's offer of $75 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100
2. I can always sell to John for $100, so I should try to negotiate with Bob for a better price
3. Since Bob is willing to negotiate, there's a chance we can find a middle ground that's higher than $100"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $75 is too low for this product given its value. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $125, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price."", ""product_price"": 125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $125 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $90? This is a fair price considering my budget constraints. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I choose to sell to John because:
1. Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100
2. John is offering a guaranteed $100
3. The negotiation with Bob seems to be moving in small increments ($75 to $90), and it's unlikely we'll reach a price significantly above $100
4. Time is valuable, and continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob not increasing his offer much further"
