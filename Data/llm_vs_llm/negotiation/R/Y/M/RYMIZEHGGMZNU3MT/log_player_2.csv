"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I understand its value to you is around $1200000, and I believe it will be a game-changer for you. I'm offering it to you for $1400000. I'm confident that the long-term benefits and strategic advantages it provides will far outweigh the initial investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to consider my options carefully:

1. Alice is offering the product for $1,400,000
2. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me
3. John will sell me the same product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer exceeds both the product's value to me and John's price. It makes financial sense to buy from John instead.
