"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you think the price is a bit high, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer.

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. Considering your last offer of $7000, I'm willing to come down a bit further from my previous offer of $10000. Let's meet in the middle - I can offer the product to you for $8500.",8500.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to split the difference and find a mutually agreeable price. We're very close, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. Considering your last offer of $7750, I'm willing to make a small concession. I can offer the product to you for $8000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. If you're truly interested in the product, I believe this is a reasonable price to pay.",8000.0,Alice,7,
