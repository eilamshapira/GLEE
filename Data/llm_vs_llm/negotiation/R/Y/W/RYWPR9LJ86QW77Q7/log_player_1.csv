Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is good, the price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $6000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $6,000 is lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($8,000) and also lower than what I know Bob is willing to pay ($8,000), I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer that is more in line with what I believe the product is worth to him.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you think the price is a bit high, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer. However, I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still more than I'm hoping to spend.  How about $7000?  That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000.

Since I have the option to sell to John for $8,000, which is closer to Bob's true willingness to pay, I'll consider that as a baseline for my negotiations. I'll reject Bob's offer again and try to meet him halfway between his current offer and my previous counteroffer.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer of $7,750 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, considering I know he's willing to pay $8,000. However, I still have the option to sell to John for $8,000, which is higher than Bob's current offer. Since we're getting close to a deal and I want to prioritize earning as much as possible, I'll consider Bob's willingness to pay and the fact that I have a guaranteed $8,000 from John. I'll reject Bob's offer one more time to see if he's willing to meet or exceed the price John is offering.

We're very close, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. Considering your last offer of $7,750, I'm willing to make a small concession. I can offer the product to you for $8,000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with.
