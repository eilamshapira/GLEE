Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to set a price for my product that is above my minimum threshold of $12,000, but also attractive enough that Bob might accept it. If I set the price too high, Bob might reject it, and I'll end up selling to John for $12,000. If I set it too low, I'll miss out on potential profit.

Since I already have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, I can afford to be somewhat aggressive with my pricing to Bob. I'll offer a price that gives me a reasonable premium over my minimum value.
