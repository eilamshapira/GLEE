"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to share with you a unique opportunity to purchase an exceptional product. I would like to offer it to you for $1500000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than John's price. I should try to negotiate a better deal with Alice before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's, but still well below my maximum and John's price. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a good deal."
