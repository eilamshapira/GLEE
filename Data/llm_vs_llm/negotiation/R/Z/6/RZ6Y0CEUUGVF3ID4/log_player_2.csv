"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since the product is worth $15,000 to me and Alice's offer is $14,000, which is very close to my maximum budget, I will consider rejecting the offer to see if I can get a better deal. However, I also don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy the product from Alice if she doesn't accept my counteroffer.

But since Alice's initial offer is already quite high, I think it's worth trying to negotiate further.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer was $14,000, I'll try to make a counteroffer that is lower, but still reasonable. Considering the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, I'll aim for a price that is closer to the midpoint between my maximum budget and Alice's minimum value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has made a new offer of $13,500, which is lower than her previous offer of $14,000. This suggests that she is willing to negotiate and flexible with her price.

Since the product is worth $15,000 to me, and Alice's new offer is $13,500, I am getting closer to a price that I am comfortable with. However, I still think I can try to get a better deal.

But considering Alice's offer is already quite reasonable, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy the product from her, I will think carefully before making my next decision.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I will make another counteroffer to see if I can get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's latest offer was $13,500, I'll try to make a counteroffer that is slightly lower, but still reasonable. I'll aim for a price that is closer to $12,000, which is a price that I think is fair considering the product's value to both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has made another new offer of $13,200, which is lower than her previous offer of $13,500. This suggests that she is still willing to negotiate and flexible with her price.

At this point, I think Alice's offer is very reasonable, and I'm getting close to a price that I'm comfortable with. Considering the product is worth $15,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $13,200, I'm saving $1,800 by buying from Alice instead of John.

I don't think I can get a significantly better deal by continuing to negotiate, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy the product from Alice.
