"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and the benefits it offers, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially offering it for $17000.",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate you considering the product. However, $10000 is lower than I can accept. How about we meet in the middle a bit? I'm willing to come down to $16000.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $11500? That's a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. While $11500 is still below what I can realistically accept, I'm willing to move a little more. Let's try $15500. This is a significant reduction and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but we're still a bit too far apart. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $12000, but that's my absolute limit.",12000.0,Bob,6,
