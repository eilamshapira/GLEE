"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great interest to you. I'm offering it at a price of $1000000, which reflects its true market value. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential return on investment. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with this purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is offering the product at its full market value. You have a better option: buying from John at the same price.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to maintain the option of buying from John, giving you the potential for negotiation or a better deal later."
