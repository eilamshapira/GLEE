"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and Alice's initial offer is $3,000,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum budget, I will reject Alice's offer.

Additionally, I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within my budget. However, I will try to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

So, my decision is: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I'm trying to save as much money as possible, I'll start by making a relatively low counteroffer. I'll offer $500,000, which is half of my maximum budget.

My counteroffer is: {""product_price"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer is still significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, I'm not willing to accept Alice's offer of $2,500,000.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to negotiate further. Maybe Alice will be willing to lower the price even more.

My decision is: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice rejected my previous offer of $500,000 and came back with a price of $2,500,000, I'll try to meet her halfway. However, I'll still keep my counteroffer below my maximum budget of $1,000,000.

My new counteroffer is: {""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer is $2,000,000, which is still twice my maximum budget of $1,000,000. I'm not willing to accept this offer, as I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000.

I'll reject Alice's offer again, but I'm starting to think that Alice may not be willing to sell the product to me at a price I'm comfortable with. I may need to consider buying from John soon.

My decision is: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice is still far from my maximum budget, I'll try to make a more reasonable counteroffer. I'll increase my previous offer of $750,000 by a small amount, hoping to show Alice that I'm willing to negotiate.

My new counteroffer is: {""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer is $1,750,000, which is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. At this point, I'm not willing to accept an offer that's 75% higher than my budget.

I think it's time to stop negotiating with Alice, as the price is still too high. I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is a much better deal for me.

My decision is: {""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}"
