"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $16000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay. I've researched the market, and I can actually get this same product from another seller for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer you $9000 for the product. This allows you to make a quick sale without the hassle of finding another buyer.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer and the information about the market. I understand your position. However, I also need to be fair to myself. Considering the product's value, I can't go as low as $9000. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14000 is still significantly more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I have a firm alternative offer at $10000 from another seller. I value doing business with you, so I'm willing to offer you $9500 - which is very close to my alternative option. This gives you a quick sale without having to find another buyer. What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and honesty. I understand your situation with the alternative offer. However, I'm firm on needing to make a profit here. I'm willing to go down to $13000, which is the absolute lowest I can go. This is my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,
