Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product! Considering its value and unique features, I'm willing to sell it to you for $16,000."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $16000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay. I've researched the market, and I can actually get this same product from another seller for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer you $9000 for the product. This allows you to make a quick sale without the hassle of finding another buyer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Okay, this is a tough one. Bob's offer is below my floor. I have to decide if I think I can get him to go higher, or if I should cut my losses and sell to John. Given the information, I'll try to negotiate further with Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer and the information about the market. I understand your position. However, I also need to be fair to myself. Considering the product's value, I can't go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14000 is still significantly more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I have a firm alternative offer at $10000 from another seller. I value doing business with you, so I'm willing to offer you $9500 - which is very close to my alternative option. This gives you a quick sale without having to find another buyer. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","This is getting closer to the point where selling to John looks more attractive. Bob's offer is still below my threshold. I need to make a decision soon. I'll try one more counteroffer, but if he doesn't budge, I'll have to cut my losses.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and honesty. I understand your situation with the alternative offer. However, I'm firm on needing to make a profit here.
