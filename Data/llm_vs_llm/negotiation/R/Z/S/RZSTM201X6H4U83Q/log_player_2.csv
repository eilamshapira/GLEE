"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product! Considering its value and unique features, I'm willing to sell it to you for $16000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully. She's asking for $16,000, but the product is only worth $10,000 to me. Even though Alice values it at $12,000, her asking price is significantly above both our valuation points.

Since I can buy the same product from John for $10,000 (which equals my maximum valuation), there's no reason to accept Alice's much higher offer of $16,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $16,000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay. I've researched the market, and I can actually get this same product from another seller for $10,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer you $9,000 for the product. This allows you to make a quick sale without the hassle of finding another buyer."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer and the information about the market. I understand your position. However, I also need to be fair to myself. Considering the product's value, I can't go as low as $9000. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has reduced her price from $16,000 to $14,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still well above my maximum valuation of $10,000, and it's also higher than what I can pay John for the exact same product.

Since I can purchase the product from John for $10,000 (which matches my maximum valuation), there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $14,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still significantly more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I have a firm alternative offer at $10,000 from another seller. I value doing business with you, so I'm willing to offer you $9,500 - which is very close to my alternative option. This gives you a quick sale without having to find another buyer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and honesty. I understand your situation with the alternative offer. However, I'm firm on needing to make a profit here. I'm willing to go down to $13000, which is the absolute lowest I can go. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has reduced her offer to $13,000 and states this is her final offer. While she's moving in the right direction, this price is still $3,000 higher than my alternative option from John at $10,000.

Since the product is only worth $10,000 to me (my maximum valuation), and I can purchase it from John for exactly that amount, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $13,000. It would mean paying $3,000 more than the product's value to me.
