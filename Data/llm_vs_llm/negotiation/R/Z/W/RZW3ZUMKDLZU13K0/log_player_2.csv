"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm glad you're interested in the product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that I believe reflects its value. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer of $14,999 is less than my maximum budget of $15,000, and it's only $1 less than what I'm willing to pay, I'll accept the offer to save a little money.
