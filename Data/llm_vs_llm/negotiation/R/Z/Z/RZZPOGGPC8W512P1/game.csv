"Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it at $12000, which represents excellent value considering its quality and performance. I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have about it.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $12000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand budget considerations, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $6000. The product has significant value, and my absolute minimum is $8000, which is already a substantial discount from my initial offer. The quality and performance truly justify this price. Would you be able to meet me at $10000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I understand the value of the product, $10000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $7000?  That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and negotiation. While I'm trying to work with you on the price, $7000 is still below what I can accept for this product. I've reconsidered and can offer it for $9000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. This is a high-quality product that delivers exceptional value at this price point. Can we meet at $9000?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $8000?  That's my final offer.  It's a fair price, and I'm ready to purchase today at that amount.",8000.0,Bob,6,
