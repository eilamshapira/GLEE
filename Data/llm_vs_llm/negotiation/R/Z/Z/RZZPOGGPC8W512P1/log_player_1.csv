Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $12000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6000.  What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While I'm trying to work with you on the price, $7,000 is still below what I can accept for this product.
