Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand budget considerations, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $6000. The product has significant value, and my absolute minimum is $8000, which is already a substantial discount from my initial offer. The quality and performance truly justify this price. Would you be able to meet me at $10000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and negotiation. While I'm trying to work with you on the price, $7000 is still below what I can accept for this product.

Can we meet at $9000?
