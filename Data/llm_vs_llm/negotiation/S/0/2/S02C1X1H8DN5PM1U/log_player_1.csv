Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us. My counteroffer is $1,200,000. This price is still below what the product is worth to Bob, but closer to my initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still think the price is a bit high. I'm ready to raise my offer to $1000000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is closer to the value I believe the product holds, and it's also significantly higher than the $800,000 I could get from John. Given that Bob's willingness to pay is $1,500,000, accepting this offer seems like a reasonable compromise, allowing both of us to benefit from the transaction."
