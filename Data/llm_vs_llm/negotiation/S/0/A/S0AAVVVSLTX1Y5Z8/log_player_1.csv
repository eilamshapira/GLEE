Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a price to sell the product to Bob that maximizes my profit while being acceptable to him.

The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, and I can always fall back to selling it to John for $800,000.

I'll start with a somewhat aggressive but still reasonable offer that gives Bob some value while also giving me a good profit:

{""product_price"": $1,250,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer of $850,000 is very low compared to the product's value to him ($1,500,000). He's only offering slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, which gives him most of the surplus value.

Since I can always fall back to selling to John for $800,000, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. The difference between Bob's offer and my fallback option is only $50,000, so I have very little risk in continuing to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a more moderate counteroffer that still gives me a good profit but moves closer to a middle ground that might be more acceptable to Bob:

{""product_price"": $1,150,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob has increased his offer by $100,000, which shows he's willing to negotiate. His offer of $950,000 is $150,000 better than my fallback option of selling to John for $800,000. However, there's still a significant gap between his offer and the product's value to him.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer that moves closer to a compromise. We're making progress in the negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll continue to move toward a compromise that's more favorable for both of us:

{""product_price"": $1,050,000}"
