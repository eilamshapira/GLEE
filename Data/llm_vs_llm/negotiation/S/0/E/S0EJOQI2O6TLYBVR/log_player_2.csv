"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd love! I'm offering it to you for $145. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Okay, I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer of $145, reject it and negotiate, or buy from John for $150.

Since the product is worth $150 to me, and Alice is offering it for $145, I'd be saving $5 by accepting Alice's offer. I could try to negotiate and potentially get a lower price, but there's a risk Alice won't agree and I'll end up paying more, or even having to buy from John for $150.

Given the small potential savings from negotiation compared to the risk of paying $150, I'll accept Alice's offer.
