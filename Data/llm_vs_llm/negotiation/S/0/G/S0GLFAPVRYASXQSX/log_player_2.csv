"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to consider my options here:

1. Accept Alice's offer of $950,000
2. Reject and make a counteroffer
3. Buy from John for $800,000

Alice's offer ($950,000) is more than the product's worth to me ($800,000), and also more than John's price ($800,000). Since I can get the same product from John for $800,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's higher price.

I should either make a counteroffer to Alice that's lower than $800,000 or simply buy from John. Since John's price already matches the maximum I'm willing to pay, and there's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower counteroffer, the rational choice is to go with the guaranteed option.
