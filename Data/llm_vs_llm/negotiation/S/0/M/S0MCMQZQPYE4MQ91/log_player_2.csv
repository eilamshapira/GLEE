"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","$150 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $80, and it's also higher than the price that John is offering ($80). Since I can buy the product from John for $80, which is equal to my maximum value, there's no reason to accept Alice's high offer.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer was quite high at $150, and I know the product is worth $120 to her, I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives her some profit while staying below my maximum value of $80.

{""product_price"": 65}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $130 is still well above my maximum value of $80, and it's also higher than John's price of $80. There's no reason for me to accept this offer when I can get the same product from John at a lower price.

I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has moved down from $150 to $130, which shows some willingness to negotiate, but she's still well above my maximum value and John's price. I'll make another counteroffer that's a bit higher than my previous one but still gives me good value while allowing Alice to make some profit.

{""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice is still offering the product at $125, which is well above my maximum value of $80 and higher than John's price of $80. Alice seems to be reducing her price very slowly, and at this rate, we may not reach an acceptable price within the remaining rounds.

Since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum value ($80), and Alice's offers remain too high, the rational decision is to buy from John.
