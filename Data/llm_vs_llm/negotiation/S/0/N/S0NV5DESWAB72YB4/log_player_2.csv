"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll really enjoy. I'm selling it for $95. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $150 to me
2. John is offering it for $150 (guaranteed option)
3. Alice is offering it for $95

Alice's offer at $95 is significantly lower than both:
- My maximum valuation ($150)
- John's price ($150)

This is a good deal as it would save me $55 compared to buying from John, and it's well below my maximum value. There's no reason to reject this offer or pay more by buying from John.
