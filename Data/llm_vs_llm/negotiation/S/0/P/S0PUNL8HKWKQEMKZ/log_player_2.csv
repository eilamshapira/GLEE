"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Okay, let's analyze the situation.

*   **Alice's Offer:** $11,500
*   **My Value:** $12,000 (maximum I'm willing to pay)
*   **Alice's Value:** $10,000
*   **John's Offer:** $12,000
*   **Rounds Remaining:** 10

I want to get the best possible price, and I have plenty of rounds to negotiate. Paying $11,500 is better than paying John $12,000, but I can potentially get a better deal. I will start negotiating.

**My Decision: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, I want to make a counteroffer. I'll try to get a price lower than Alice's initial offer.

**My Counteroffer: {""product_price"": 11000}**"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Okay, let's reassess.

*   **Alice's Offer:** $11,300
*   **My Value:** $12,000
*   **Alice's Value:** $10,000
*   **John's Offer:** $12,000
*   **Rounds Remaining:** 8

The price is still above what I ideally want to pay, but it's better than John's offer. I still have several rounds left to try to negotiate a lower price. I'll reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate for a better price.

**My Decision: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, time for another counteroffer. I'll try to get Alice a bit closer to my ideal price.

**My Counteroffer: {""product_price"": 10800}**"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Okay, let's look at this round.

*   **Alice's Offer:** $11,000
*   **My Value:** $12,000
*   **Alice's Value:** $10,000
*   **John's Offer:** $12,000
*   **Rounds Remaining:** 6

$11,000 is still higher than I'd like, but it's getting closer. I'm still saving money compared to buying from John. I still have a few more rounds, so I'll push a little further.

**My Decision: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alright, here's my counteroffer. I'll try to move the price down a bit more.

**My Counteroffer: {""product_price"": 10500}**"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Okay, let's evaluate this round.

*   **Alice's Offer:** $10,800
*   **My Value:** $12,000
*   **Alice's Value:** $10,000
*   **John's Offer:** $12,000
*   **Rounds Remaining:** 4

The price is still above my ideal, but with only 4 rounds left, I should consider accepting the offer. The difference between $10,800 and my ideal price is less than $10,800 and John's offer.

**My Decision: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, it's getting closer to the end. I'll try one more counteroffer, and if it's rejected, I'll seriously consider taking her next offer.

**My Counteroffer: {""product_price"": 10600}**"
