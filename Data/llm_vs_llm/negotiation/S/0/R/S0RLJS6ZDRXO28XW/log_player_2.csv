"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to offer you my product for $200. It's a great value and I think you'll be very happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer of $200 is higher than both my maximum value ($150) and John's price ($150), it doesn't make sense to accept this offer. While I could make a counteroffer, I already know that John is willing to sell at $150, which is exactly my maximum value. Since there's no guarantee that negotiating with Alice will result in a better price (especially since the product is worth $150 to her), the most rational decision is to buy from John.
