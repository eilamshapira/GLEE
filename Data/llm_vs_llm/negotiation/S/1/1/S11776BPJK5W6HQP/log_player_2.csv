"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer is clearly not acceptable as it's twice the amount I can get from John ($10,000). Since I have 10 rounds of negotiation available, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice for a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still reasonable enough to negotiate.

{""product_price"": 8000}

This counteroffer makes sense because:
1. It's below John's price of $10,000, giving me room to save money
2. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial $20,000 offer, but not so low as to be insulting
3. It leaves room for negotiation if Alice counteroffers
4. If Alice accepts, I'll save $2,000 compared to John's offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice only reduced her price by $2,000 from $20,000 to $18,000, which is still significantly higher than John's price of $10,000. Since we still have several rounds of negotiation left, it's worth continuing to negotiate. Her willingness to reduce the price, even slightly, shows there might be room for further negotiation, but if we can't get close to John's price soon, we'll need to consider taking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm increasing my offer by $1,000 from my previous offer of $8,000 to show willingness to negotiate, but still keeping it below John's price of $10,000. This strategy:

1. Shows good faith by moving up from my previous offer
2. Still gives me a $1,000 savings compared to John's price if accepted
3. Signals to Alice that I'm serious about staying below $10,000 (since that's my alternative option with John)
4. Maintains room for further negotiation while being more reasonable than my initial counteroffer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'm choosing to buy from John because:
1. Alice's latest offer of $17,000 is still $7,000 higher than John's price
2. While Alice is making small reductions ($1,000 at a time), the pace of reduction suggests we won't reach anywhere near $10,000 in the remaining rounds
3. The product is only worth $10,000 to me, so paying $17,000 would result in a significant loss
4. John's offer of $10,000 is guaranteed and available now
5. There's no point in continuing negotiations when the gap is this large and Alice's reductions are this small"
