"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this high-quality product today. Based on market values and the product's features, I'm offering it to you for $10000. This is a competitive price for a product of this caliber, and I believe it represents good value. I'm open to discussing this offer to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'll analyze this situation:

1) Alice is offering the product for $10,000
2) The product is worth $8,000 to me (my maximum value)
3) John is willing to sell me the same product for $8,000

Alice's offer exceeds my maximum value, and there's no reason to pay more than the product is worth to me. Even if I tried negotiating with Alice, I can't do better than John's price since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice (her cost).

The optimal decision is to buy from John immediately.
