Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that Bob values the product at $15,000 and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $15,000, I'll start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I don't go below my minimum acceptable price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and I already have a guaranteed offer from John at $15,000, there's no reason to accept Bob's low offer. While I could make another counteroffer, there's a risk of prolonging negotiations without guarantee of a better outcome. Given that John's offer meets my minimum price requirement, the most rational decision is to sell to John.
