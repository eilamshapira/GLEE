"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $25000 is far more than I'm willing to pay. I'm  confident this product is worth $8000 to me.  That's my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,2,
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $8000 is significantly below the product's value. Given its quality and market position, I can offer it to you for $22000. This is already a substantial reduction from my initial offer.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer

"Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $22000 is still beyond my budget. I'm happy to pay $10000 for it.  It's a fair price for a product I'm interested in. Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
"I apologize Bob, but I cannot accept $10000 for this product as it's significantly below its market value. I have another buyer willing to pay a price that better reflects the product's worth. Thank you for your interest, but I'll have to end our negotiation here.",,Alice,4,SellToJhon
