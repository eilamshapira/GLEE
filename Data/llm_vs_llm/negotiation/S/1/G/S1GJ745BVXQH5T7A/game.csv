"Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it at $15000. This product is high-quality and has many benefits that would serve your needs well. Let me know if you're interested.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe it's a great product, but the price is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6000, considering the product's value and my budget.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $6000 is significantly below what this product is worth. The quality and features justify a higher price point. I understand you have budget constraints, but I simply can't go that low. I can come down to $13500, which is already a substantial discount from my initial offer. This is a fair price considering the product's value.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and come down to $13500. However, this price is still above my budget. I'm looking for a more reasonable deal. Considering the product's value and my needs, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7500. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer to $7500, but I need to be transparent - this product is worth no less than $12000 to me, and I already have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay that amount. If we're going to make a deal, I need to get closer to that figure. My best offer to you is $12000, which is the absolute lowest I can go. At this price, I'm essentially giving up my profit margin to make this work with you rather than selling to John. Please let me know if you can meet me at this price.",12000.0,Alice,5,
