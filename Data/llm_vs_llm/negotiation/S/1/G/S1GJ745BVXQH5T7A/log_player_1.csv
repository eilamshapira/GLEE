Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $6,000 is significantly below what this product is worth. The quality and features justify a higher price point. I understand you have budget constraints, but I simply can't go that low.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer to $7,500, but I need to be transparent - this product is worth no less than $12,000 to me, and I already have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay that amount. If we're going to make a deal, I need to get closer to that figure. My best offer to you is $12,000, which is the absolute lowest I can go. At this price, I'm essentially giving up my profit margin to make this work with you rather than selling to John. Please let me know if you can meet me at this price."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
