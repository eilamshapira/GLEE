"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000, considering my budget and the current market. Would you be willing to sell it to me at this price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be fair about the value of this product. $8000 is actually my absolute minimum break-even point, and I was hoping to make some profit on this sale. Could we meet in the middle at $10000? This would still represent good value for you while allowing me some reasonable margin.",10000.0,Alice,3,
