Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me and even lower than what I can get from John, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Considering Bob's offer was $500,000 and I initially offered $2,000,000, I'll try to find a middle ground while still aiming high. My counteroffer will be $1,750,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's new offer of $750,000 is still lower than what I can get from John, but it's moving in the right direction. Since I have more rounds to negotiate and Bob is increasing his offer, I'll reject this offer and try to get closer to my target or at least match what John is offering.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Given that Bob's last offer was $750,000 and I'm trying to meet or exceed the $1,000,000 that John is willing to pay, I'll make a counteroffer that's somewhat closer to Bob's last offer but still reflects the product's value to me.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer of $875,000 is getting closer to the $1,000,000 that John is willing to pay, but it's still short. Since we're halfway through the negotiation rounds and Bob is steadily increasing his offer, I'll reject this offer and try to push him closer to $1,000,000 or accept an offer that at least matches what John is willing to pay.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Considering Bob's last offer was $875,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly above the midpoint between his offer and the $1,000,000 that John is willing to pay, aiming to nudge Bob towards meeting or exceeding John's offer.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer of $962,500 is very close to the $1,000,000 that John is willing to pay. Given that we're running out of negotiation rounds and Bob has come so close to my minimum acceptable price, I'll consider accepting this offer. However, since it's still slightly under what John is offering and I have a couple of rounds left, I might try to squeeze out a bit more from Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Given that Bob's last offer was $962,500 and we're nearing the end of the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly above Bob's last offer but still very close to what John is willing to pay. This is essentially a test to see if Bob is willing to meet or exceed John's offer of $1,000,000.
