Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my options carefully here. The product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at exactly that price. Bob values the product at only $8,000, which is less than what the product is worth to me.

Since Bob won't pay more than what the product is worth to him ($8,000), and I won't sell for less than $15,000, there's no zone of possible agreement with Bob. Any price that would be acceptable to Bob would result in me losing money compared to my guaranteed alternative with John.

Therefore, I should offer a price that maintains my dignity but that I know Bob will reject, allowing me to proceed with selling to John for $15,000.
