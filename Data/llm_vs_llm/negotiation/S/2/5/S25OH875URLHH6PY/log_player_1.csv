Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'd like to start the negotiation at a price that reflects its true value."", ""product_price"": 11000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price. I'd like to make a counteroffer that I believe is fair and reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $9,000 is lower than I'm willing to accept. My counteroffer will be $10,500. This price is still below the value Bob has for the product ($12,000), but closer to what I'm willing to accept. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I believe the product is worth more than $9,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,500, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value.""}"

Bob's offer:

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob, as $9,500 is still slightly lower than I'm willing to accept. My counteroffer will be $10,000. This price is closer to what Bob is willing to pay ($12,000), and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.
