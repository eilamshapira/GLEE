Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 150}

Rationale: Since I know that:
1. The product is worth $150 minimum to me
2. Bob values the product at only $80
3. I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150

There's no reason for me to offer the product to Bob for less than $150. Bob will likely reject this offer since it's well above his valuation of $80, but that's fine because I can then sell to John for $150. This way, I ensure I get the maximum possible value for the product."
