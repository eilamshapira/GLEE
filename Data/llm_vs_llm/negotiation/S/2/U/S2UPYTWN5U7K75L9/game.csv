"Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I'm offering to you at a discounted price of $1300000. This is an exclusive opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset that will be beneficial for your business growth.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1300000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, which is the same price John is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer $850000 for the product. This would save me money compared to John's offer while still providing you with a substantial payment for a product that's worth $1200000 to you.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your offer. However, $850000 is significantly below my bottom line. The product is actually worth $1200000 to me, which is why John is willing to pay that amount. I understand your budget constraints, but I need to ensure I receive fair value. I can come down to $1180000, which gives you a $20000 discount compared to what John is offering me. This is the best I can do while still meeting my financial requirements.",1180000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I think there's been a misunderstanding. John isn't offering to buy the product from you - he's a competing seller offering to sell me the same product for $1000000. Your product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, so I can't accept any offer above that price, as it would make more financial sense for me to buy from John. However, I'd still prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer you $900000 for the product. This would save me $100000 compared to John's price, while still giving you a reasonable profit considering your cost basis of $1200000.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for clarifying. I think there's still some confusion. In my situation, John is not a competing seller - he's another potential buyer who has already committed to purchasing the product from me for $1200000, which is my minimum acceptable price since that's what the product is worth to me. I cannot sell below $1200000 as that would mean taking a loss. Given that you value the product at $1000000, I understand this may not work for you, but my best offer is $1200000. This is exactly what John is willing to pay me, but I'm giving you the opportunity first.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
