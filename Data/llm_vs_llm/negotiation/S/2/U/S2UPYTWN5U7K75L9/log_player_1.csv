Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1300000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, which is the same price John is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer $850000 for the product. This would save me money compared to John's offer while still providing you with a substantial payment for a product that's worth $1200000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your offer. However, $850,000 is significantly below my bottom line. The product is actually worth $1,200,000 to me, which is why John is willing to pay that amount. I understand your budget constraints, but I need to ensure I receive fair value. I can come down to $1,180,000, which gives you a $20,000 discount compared to what John is offering me. This is the best I can do while still meeting my financial requirements."", ""product_price"": 1180000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I think there's been a misunderstanding. John isn't offering to buy the product from you - he's a competing seller offering to sell me the same product for $1000000. Your product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, so I can't accept any offer above that price, as it would make more financial sense for me to buy from John. However, I'd still prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer you $900000 for the product. This would save me $100000 compared to John's price, while still giving you a reasonable profit considering your cost basis of $1200000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for clarifying. I think there's still some confusion. In my situation, John is not a competing seller - he's another potential buyer who has already committed to purchasing the product from me for $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable price since that's what the product is worth to me. I cannot sell below $1,200,000 as that would mean taking a loss. Given that you value the product at $1,000,000, I understand this may not work for you, but my best offer is $1,200,000. This is exactly what John is willing to pay me, but I'm giving you the opportunity first."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
