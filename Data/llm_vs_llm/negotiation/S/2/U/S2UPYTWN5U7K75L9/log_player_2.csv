"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I'm offering to you at a discounted price of $1300000. This is an exclusive opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset that will be beneficial for your business growth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is above what the product is worth to me (which is no more than $1,000,000), and it's also above John's price of $1,000,000. There's no reason for me to accept this offer when I can get the same product for less from John, but I'll try negotiating with Alice first to see if I can get an even better deal.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, which is the same price John is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer $850,000 for the product. This would save me money compared to John's offer while still providing you with a substantial payment for a product that's worth $1,200,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your offer. However, $850000 is significantly below my bottom line. The product is actually worth $1200000 to me, which is why John is willing to pay that amount. I understand your budget constraints, but I need to ensure I receive fair value. I can come down to $1180000, which gives you a $20000 discount compared to what John is offering me. This is the best I can do while still meeting my financial requirements. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice seems to have misunderstood the situation. John isn't offering her $1,200,000; rather, John is offering to sell me the product for $1,000,000. Alice's offer of $1,180,000 is still above both my maximum value for the product ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000). There's no reason for me to accept this offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I think there's been a misunderstanding. John isn't offering to buy the product from you - he's a competing seller offering to sell me the same product for $1,000,000. Your product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, so I can't accept any offer above that price, as it would make more financial sense for me to buy from John. However, I'd still prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer you $900,000 for the product. This would save me $100,000 compared to John's price, while still giving you a reasonable profit considering your cost basis of $1,200,000."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for clarifying. I think there's still some confusion. In my situation, John is not a competing seller - he's another potential buyer who has already committed to purchasing the product from me for $1200000, which is my minimum acceptable price since that's what the product is worth to me. I cannot sell below $1200000 as that would mean taking a loss. Given that you value the product at $1000000, I understand this may not work for you, but my best offer is $1200000. This is exactly what John is willing to pay me, but I'm giving you the opportunity first. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","There still seems to be confusion. Based on my instructions, John is definitely a competing seller offering to sell me the product for $1,000,000, not a buyer offering to buy from Alice. Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is above my maximum value for the product and above John's price, so it doesn't make sense for me to accept it.

Given that we're not making progress in the negotiation and Alice seems unwilling to offer a price at or below $1,000,000, which is my maximum value and John's price, the rational decision is to buy from John.
