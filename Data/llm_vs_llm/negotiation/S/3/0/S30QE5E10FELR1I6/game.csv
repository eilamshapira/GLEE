"Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1800000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and potential.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the details you've shared about the product. However, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product, considering its potential value to me.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I must inform you that $850000 is well below the product's value. I actually have another buyer willing to pay $1500000, but I'm giving you priority as I believe you could be a good fit for this product. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1600000, which is a significant reduction. Keep in mind that I cannot go below $1500000 as that would not make business sense for me.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. While $1600000 is still outside my budget, I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This offer reflects the value I see in the product and my ability to pay. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
