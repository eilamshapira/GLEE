"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and potential."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the details you've shared about the product. However, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product, considering its potential value to me.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let me make a counteroffer to Bob. The price he's offering ($850,000) is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Since I have John's guaranteed offer at $1,500,000, I won't accept anything lower than that. However, I'll give Bob another chance with a lower price than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I must inform you that $850,000 is well below the product's value. I actually have another buyer willing to pay $1,500,000, but I'm giving you priority as I believe you could be a good fit for this product. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1,600,000, which is a significant reduction. Keep in mind that I cannot go below $1,500,000 as that would not make business sense for me."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. While $1600000 is still outside my budget, I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This offer reflects the value I see in the product and my ability to pay. Let's see if we can find a common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly below the guaranteed $1,500,000 I can get from John, and given that Bob seems unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price even after several more rounds of negotiation, it makes the most business sense to accept John's offer. This ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price without further delay or uncertainty."
