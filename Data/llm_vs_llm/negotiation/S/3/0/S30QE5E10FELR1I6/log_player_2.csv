Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I must inform you that $850000 is well below the product's value. I actually have another buyer willing to pay $1500000, but I'm giving you priority as I believe you could be a good fit for this product. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1600000, which is a significant reduction. Keep in mind that I cannot go below $1500000 as that would not make business sense for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
