"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I find the price a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $600000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I cannot accept $600000 as it's significantly below the product's market value. While I can be somewhat flexible on the price, I need to ensure I receive fair value. I can offer it to you for $1000000, which is already a substantial reduction from my initial price. This price better reflects the product's true worth and quality.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for being flexible with the price. I appreciate the reduction to $1000000. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product for $800000, but I was thinking maybe we could do a little better than that. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $750000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
