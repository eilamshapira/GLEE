Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I find the price a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $600000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. The offered price of $600,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $800,000 (which is what John is willing to pay), so I cannot accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I cannot accept $600,000 as it's significantly below the product's market value. While I can be somewhat flexible on the price, I need to ensure I receive fair value. I can offer it to you for $1,000,000, which is already a substantial reduction from my initial price. This price better reflects the product's true worth and quality."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for being flexible with the price. I appreciate the reduction to $1000000. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product for $800000, but I was thinking maybe we could do a little better than that. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $750000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $800,000. Bob's offer of $750,000 is still below what John is willing to pay, and since Bob's latest offer is actually lower than John's guaranteed price, it makes more sense to take the sure deal with John rather than continue negotiating for a potentially lower amount."
