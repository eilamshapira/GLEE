Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I cannot accept $600000 as it's significantly below the product's market value. While I can be somewhat flexible on the price, I need to ensure I receive fair value. I can offer it to you for $1000000, which is already a substantial reduction from my initial price. This price better reflects the product's true worth and quality.
