"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $9,500, I notice it's still $500 less than John's fixed price of $10,000. However, since I know the product is only worth $8,000 to Alice, there's significant room for negotiation. I should reject this first offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

This is still $800 above her cost of $8,000, so there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round since we still have plenty of rounds left, and the current offer is still better than John's $10,000.
