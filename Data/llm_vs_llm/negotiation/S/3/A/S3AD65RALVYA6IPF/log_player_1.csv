Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that:
1. The product is worth $1,000,000 to me (minimum acceptable price)
2. The product is worth $800,000 to Bob
3. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $1,000,000

I will offer the product to Bob at $1,000,000 because:
- Since Bob values it at $800,000, he will reject any price above that
- I have no incentive to offer below $1,000,000 since I have a guaranteed buyer at that price
- When Bob rejects (as he rationally should), I can sell to John for $1,000,000
