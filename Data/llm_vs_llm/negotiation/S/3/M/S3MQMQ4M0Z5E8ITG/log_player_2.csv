"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $95. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to consider my options here:

1. Accept Alice's offer at $95
2. Reject and make a counteroffer
3. Buy from John at $100

Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and Alice's offer is $95 which is already below my maximum valuation, it seems reasonable. However, I know the product is worth $80 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation to get a better price.

John's fixed price of $100 is my worst option since it's the highest price.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $95 is a bit high for me. I'd like to propose $85 instead, which I think is fair and would work well for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $85 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we settle at $90? I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to consider my options again:

1. Accept Alice's offer at $90
2. Reject and make another counteroffer
3. Buy from John at $100

Alice has come down from $95 to $90, which is a good sign. The product is worth no more than $100 to me, so $90 is within my acceptable range. I know the product is worth $80 to Alice, so there's still a small margin for negotiation, but we're getting closer to a fair price.

John's price remains at $100, which is still my highest cost option.

Given that Alice has already moved $5 from her initial offer and we're now at a reasonable price point of $90 (which gives me $10 of value), I'll accept this offer.
