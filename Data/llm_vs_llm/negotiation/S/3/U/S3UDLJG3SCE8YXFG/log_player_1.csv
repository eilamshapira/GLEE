Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $18,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product's potential value, $18000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $8000.  I believe this is a reasonable starting point for negotiations, considering I have alternative options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my initial price and the value I know the product holds, I will reject his offer. I am willing to negotiate further to try to reach a mutually agreeable price, but I will not sell it for such a low price, especially considering I have a better alternative with John.

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $8,000 is below my expectations.

Bob's offer:
