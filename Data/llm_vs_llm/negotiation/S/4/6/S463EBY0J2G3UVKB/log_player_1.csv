Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a reasonable price to offer Bob for the product. Since the product is worth at least $8,000 to me and I have John as a guaranteed backup buyer at exactly $8,000, I should offer Bob a price higher than $8,000 to maximize my profit.

However, I don't want to set the price too high that Bob automatically rejects it. I'll aim for a moderate premium above my minimum value.
