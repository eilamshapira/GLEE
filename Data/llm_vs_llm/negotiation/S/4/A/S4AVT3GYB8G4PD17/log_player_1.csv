Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its worth."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm willing to pay a price that's closer to its actual value. I'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price. 

My counteroffer: $18,000"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I must emphasize that this product has significant value to me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure I get a fair deal. I'd like to make a counteroffer that's still premium, but slightly more reasonable than my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and lower the price. However, I still believe that $18000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer is now at $15,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept and also the same price that John is offering, I don't see a need to continue negotiating. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to sell the product to him at a price that meets my minimum requirement, and it also saves me from potentially losing both deals if I were to reject it and try to negotiate further."
