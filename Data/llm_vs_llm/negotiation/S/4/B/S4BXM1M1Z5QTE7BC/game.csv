"Hello Bob, I'm reaching out to offer you a product that I believe would be of value to you. I'm offering it at a price of $11500. This represents a fair market value for a product of this quality. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions.",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $11500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it, and allows me to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $10500 is unfortunately too low for me to accept. The product has significant value, and I believe $11200 is a more reasonable price that still offers you a good deal compared to market rates. This represents a $300 reduction from my initial offer and would be a mutually beneficial arrangement. Would this work for you?",11200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $11200 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10800. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",10800.0,Bob,4,
