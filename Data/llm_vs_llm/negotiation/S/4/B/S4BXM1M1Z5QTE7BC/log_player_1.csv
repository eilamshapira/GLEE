Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me to accept. The product has significant value, and I believe $11,200 is a more reasonable price that still offers you a good deal compared to market rates. This represents a $300 reduction from my initial offer and would be a mutually beneficial arrangement. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 11200}"
