"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm reaching out to offer you a product that I believe would be of value to you. I'm offering it at a price of $11500. This represents a fair market value for a product of this quality. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your target price of $12,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $11,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it, and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $10500 is unfortunately too low for me to accept. The product has significant value, and I believe $11200 is a more reasonable price that still offers you a good deal compared to market rates. This represents a $300 reduction from my initial offer and would be a mutually beneficial arrangement. Would this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget. You're still aiming for a price closer to $10,500.  Rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer is a good strategy to continue negotiating."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $11,200 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,800. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10800}
