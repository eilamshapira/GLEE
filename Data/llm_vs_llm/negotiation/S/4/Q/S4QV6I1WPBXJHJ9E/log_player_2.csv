"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think would be perfect for you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it to you for $135. This is a fair price for a product of this caliber. Would you like to purchase it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to consider if Alice's offer is a good deal for me.

Alice is offering the product for $135, but the product is only worth $120 to me (that's my maximum valuation).

John is willing to sell me the same product for $120, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since Alice's price ($135) exceeds my maximum valuation ($120), and I have an alternative to buy from John at exactly my maximum valuation, the rational choice is to not accept Alice's offer.
