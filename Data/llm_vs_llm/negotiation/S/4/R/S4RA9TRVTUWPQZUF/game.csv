"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. Your product interests me, but I believe $950000 is a bit high for what I'm looking for. I would be willing to pay $750000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its market value.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $750000 is too low for this product. However, I'm willing to come down in price. How about $925000?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I understand you can't go as low as $750000, but $925000 is still a bit high for me. I can increase my offer to $825000, which I believe is a fair middle ground between our positions.",825000.0,Bob,4,
