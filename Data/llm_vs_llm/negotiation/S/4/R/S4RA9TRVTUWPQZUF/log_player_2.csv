"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Considering its unique qualities and potential, I'm offering it to you for $950000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $1,500,000
2. Alice's offer is $950,000, which is significantly below my maximum value
3. I have John's offer of $1,500,000 as a backup
4. Alice's initial offer seems reasonable, but there might be room for negotiation

Since Alice's first offer is already well below my maximum value (saving me $550,000), I could accept it. However, since this is the first round and sellers often start high, I believe there might be room to negotiate an even better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice started at $950,000, I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's lower but not insultingly low. Given that we have multiple rounds to negotiate, I'll start with a price that leaves room for back-and-forth negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. Your product interests me, but I believe $950,000 is a bit high for what I'm looking for. I would be willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its market value."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $750000 is too low for this product. However, I'm willing to come down in price. How about $925000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let's analyze the situation:

1. Alice's initial offer was $950,000
2. I countered with $750,000
3. Alice has now come down to $925,000, showing only a small reduction ($25,000)
4. Alice's minimal movement suggests she might not be willing to go much lower
5. The current offer still saves me $575,000 compared to John's price
6. We still have several rounds left for negotiation

While $925,000 is a good price compared to my maximum value, Alice's small reduction suggests she might still have some room to negotiate. I'll reject this offer and try one more time for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice only reduced her price by $25,000 (from $950,000 to $925,000), I'll make a more modest increase from my previous offer to show I'm willing to be reasonable while still trying to get a better deal.

{""message"": ""Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I understand you can't go as low as $750,000, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I can increase my offer to $825,000, which I believe is a fair middle ground between our positions."", ""product_price"": 825000}"
