Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll really love. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's much higher than I was expecting. Would you consider $50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Okay, given Bob's counteroffer of $50, I have to consider my options carefully. Selling to John for $120 is a guaranteed profit. While $50 is tempting to get rid of the product quickly, it is not the best option. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer. I can't go down to $50, that's far too low. How about we meet in the middle at $160?"", ""product_price"": 160}"
