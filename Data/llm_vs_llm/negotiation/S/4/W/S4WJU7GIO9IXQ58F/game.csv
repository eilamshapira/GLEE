"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While $110 is under my budget, I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. The product is worth $120 to me, but I know there are similar products on the market for less. I'd like to offer $90 for the product, which gives you a decent profit while also giving me some savings. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, after considering your offer, I'm willing to lower my price to $105. This is a fair middle ground, and I believe it reflects the value of the product well. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price to $105. We're making progress, but I think we can find a price that's even more fair for both of us. Given that there are alternatives on the market, I'm willing to increase my offer to $95. This gives you a solid $15 profit margin while allowing me to save a bit more. Does that work for you?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I've reconsidered my previous offer and I'm willing to go down to $102. This is a very fair price and I believe it reflects the product's value well. We are running out of negotiation rounds, so I encourage you to consider this offer carefully. I am willing to offer this price only until the end of this round. What do you say?",102.0,Alice,5,
