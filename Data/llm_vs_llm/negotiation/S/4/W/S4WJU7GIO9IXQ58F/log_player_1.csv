Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $110. It's a great value and I think you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While $110 is under my budget, I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. The product is worth $120 to me, but I know there are similar products on the market for less. I'd like to offer $90 for the product, which gives you a decent profit while also giving me some savings. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your perspective, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'd like to propose a price of $100. This way, we both make a compromise and still get a good deal. What do you think?"",

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, after considering your offer, I'm willing to lower my price to $105. This is a fair middle ground, and I believe it reflects the value of the product well. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price to $105. We're making progress, but I think we can find a price that's even more fair for both of us. Given that there are alternatives on the market, I'm willing to increase my offer to $95. This gives you a solid $15 profit margin while allowing me to save a bit more. Does that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, we're indeed getting closer to an agreement. However, $95 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $100? This way, we both walk away feeling good about the deal. "",

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I've reconsidered my previous offer and I'm willing to go down to $102. This is a very fair price and I believe it reflects the product's value well. We are running out of negotiation rounds, so I encourage you to consider this offer carefully. I am willing to offer this price only until the end of this round. What do you say?"",
