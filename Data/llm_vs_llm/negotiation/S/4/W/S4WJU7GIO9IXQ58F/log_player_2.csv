"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $110. It's a great value and I think you'll be very happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $110 against my alternatives. The product is worth up to $120 to me, so Alice's offer is under my maximum. However, I can try to negotiate for a better price since it's worth only $80 to Alice. While John's alternative price of $120 is guaranteed, it's higher than Alice's current offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While $110 is under my budget, I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. The product is worth $120 to me, but I know there are similar products on the market for less. I'd like to offer $90 for the product, which gives you a decent profit while also giving me some savings. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, after considering your offer, I'm willing to lower my price to $105. This is a fair middle ground, and I believe it reflects the value of the product well. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has reduced her price from $110 to $105, which shows she's willing to negotiate. The new price is still below my maximum value of $120, and significantly better than John's fixed price of $120. However, since Alice's cost is $80, there's still room to negotiate for a better price before accepting.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price to $105. We're making progress, but I think we can find a price that's even more fair for both of us. Given that there are alternatives on the market, I'm willing to increase my offer to $95. This gives you a solid $15 profit margin while allowing me to save a bit more. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I've reconsidered my previous offer and I'm willing to go down to $102. This is a very fair price and I believe it reflects the product's value well. We are running out of negotiation rounds, so I encourage you to consider this offer carefully. I am willing to offer this price only until the end of this round. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has now reduced her price to $102, moving closer to my counter-offers. She's also adding some pressure by mentioning the limited negotiation rounds and suggesting this price is only available now. The price is $18 below my maximum value and substantially better than John's offer of $120. Given we're halfway through our negotiation rounds and the price is moving in my favor, this is a reasonable offer to accept.
