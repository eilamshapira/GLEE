Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $12000. What do you think?,12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I've done some market research, and I can get this product elsewhere for much less. I'm willing to offer $6000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good price. However, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000.",10000.0,Alice,3,
