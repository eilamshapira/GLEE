Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I've done some market research, and I can get this product elsewhere for much less. I'm willing to offer $6000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Considering Bob's counteroffer of $6,000 and my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, I need to reject his offer. I also don't want to give up on a potentially higher price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good price. However, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
