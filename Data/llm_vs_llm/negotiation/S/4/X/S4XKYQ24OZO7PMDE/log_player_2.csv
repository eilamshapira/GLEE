"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $12,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $8,000

I should reject Alice's offer of $12,000 since it's way above both my maximum value and John's price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I've done some market research, and I can get this product elsewhere for much less. I'm willing to offer $6,000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good price. However, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me
2. Alice's new offer of $10,000 is still above my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $8,000, which is exactly my maximum value

Since Alice's offer is still $2,000 above what I can get from John, and above my maximum value, the logical choice is to buy from John.
