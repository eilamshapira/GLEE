"Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must point out that $600000 is significantly below the product's market value. I have other interested buyers willing to pay substantially more. However, I'd like to work with you and can reduce my initial asking price to $875000. This is still a competitive price for the value you'll receive.",875000.0,Alice,3,
