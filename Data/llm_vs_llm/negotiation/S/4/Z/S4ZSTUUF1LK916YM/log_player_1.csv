"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be beneficial for you. Given its market value and potential, I'm offering it at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and capabilities."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. After reviewing the value and considering other options, I'm prepared to buy the product for $600000. I believe this is a fair start for further discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since $600,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I know I can get $800,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept such a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must point out that $600,000 is significantly below the product's market value. I have other interested buyers willing to pay substantially more. However, I'd like to work with you and can reduce my initial asking price to $875,000. This is still a competitive price for the value you'll receive."", ""product_price"": 875000}"
