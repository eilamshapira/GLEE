Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to sell it to you at a competitive price.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer. Given the current market and my own budget considerations, I'm prepared to move forward if we can agree on $11000 for the product. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $11,000 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($10,000) but lower than my initial offer, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer, aiming to get closer to my target price.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, but I still believe the product's value is higher.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for working with me on this. I understand you've adjusted your offer, but considering my budget limits, I have to stick to my offer of $12000. I'm ready to finalize the deal at that price if you can accommodate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $12,000 is getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with, and it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, I'll choose to accept Bob's offer. This price is still lower than the product's worth to Bob ($15,000), so I believe it's a reasonable compromise.
