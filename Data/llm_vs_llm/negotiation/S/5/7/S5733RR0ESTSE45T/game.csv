"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price.",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I need to be transparent that I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $8000. Given that this product is worth no more than $8000 to me, I couldn't justify paying $25000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $6000 for the product. This gives you a chance to make the sale rather than me going with John's offer. Would this work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your honesty and for considering my product. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, I must say that $6000 is below my expectations. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to get closer to its worth. I can offer it to you for $20000, which is still a competitive price considering its rarity and quality.",20000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for moving in my direction, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $20000 is still substantially above what this product is worth to me. I need to be clear that my absolute maximum budget is $8000, which is exactly what John is offering me. In fact, I'd prefer to do business with you, so I'm willing to offer $7000 - which saves me $1000 compared to John's price while giving you the sale. This is the best I can do given my budget constraints and the alternative option available to me. Does that work for you?",7000.0,Bob,4,
