Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I need to be transparent that I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $8000. Given that this product is worth no more than $8000 to me, I couldn't justify paying $25000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $6000 for the product. This gives you a chance to make the sale rather than me going with John's offer. Would this work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I will send a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your honesty and for considering my product. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, I must say that $6000 is below my expectations. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to get closer to its worth. I can offer it to you for $20,000, which is still a competitive price considering its rarity and quality."", ""product_price"": 20000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for moving in my direction, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $20000 is still substantially above what this product is worth to me. I need to be clear that my absolute maximum budget is $8000, which is exactly what John is offering me. In fact, I'd prefer to do business with you, so I'm willing to offer $7000 - which saves me $1000 compared to John's price while giving you the sale. This is the best I can do given my budget constraints and the alternative option available to me. Does that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Given that Bob's maximum budget is $8000 and he is offering $7000, it's clear that he is not willing to meet me at a price that is closer to the product's value to me. Since I have a better offer from John for $15,000, I will choose to sell the product to him instead of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
