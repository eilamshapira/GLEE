"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that the product is worth no more than $8,000 to you, and John is willing to sell the same product for $8,000, Alice's offer of $25,000 is extremely high. There's no reason to pay more than the product's value to you, especially when you have a guaranteed alternative at the maximum price you're willing to pay.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I need to be transparent that I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $8,000. Given that this product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, I couldn't justify paying $25,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $6,000 for the product. This gives you a chance to make the sale rather than me going with John's offer. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your honesty and for considering my product. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, I must say that $6000 is below my expectations. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to get closer to its worth. I can offer it to you for $20000, which is still a competitive price considering its rarity and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that Alice's new offer of $20,000 is still well above the product's maximum value to me ($8,000) and significantly higher than John's guaranteed offer of $8,000, I should reject this offer and make another counteroffer or consider John's alternative.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for moving in my direction, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $20,000 is still substantially above what this product is worth to me. I need to be clear that my absolute maximum budget is $8,000, which is exactly what John is offering me. In fact, I'd prefer to do business with you, so I'm willing to offer $7,000 - which saves me $1,000 compared to John's price while giving you the sale. This is the best I can do given my budget constraints and the alternative option available to me. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 7000}"
