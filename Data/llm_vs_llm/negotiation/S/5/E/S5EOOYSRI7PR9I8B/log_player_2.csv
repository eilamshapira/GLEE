"Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer and make a decision based on my goal of buying the product while saving as much money as possible.

Alice is offering the product for $800,000, which is exactly the same price that John is offering, and it's also exactly the maximum amount the product is worth to me ($800,000).

Since both offers are identical in price, and both prices match my maximum valuation, I'm indifferent between options 1 and 3. However, there's no advantage to rejecting Alice's offer (option 2) since the alternative is the same price.
