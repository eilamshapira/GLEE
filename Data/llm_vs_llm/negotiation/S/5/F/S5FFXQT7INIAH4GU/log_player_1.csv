Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $1,000,000 because it's below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000 (which is what John is willing to pay). 

I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round, lowering my initial price but still keeping it well above John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2,000,000}

I'm lowering my initial offer by $500,000 to show flexibility in negotiations, while still maintaining a price that would give me significantly better returns than John's offer. This leaves room for further negotiation while keeping the price well above my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I reject Bob's offer of $1,200,000 because it's still below John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. There's no reason for me to accept less than what I can definitely get from John. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, but if Bob doesn't significantly increase his price, I may need to consider selling to John instead."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1,800,000}

I'm lowering my offer again to show continued willingness to negotiate, but still maintaining a price that's significantly above John's offer of $1,500,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring I don't go below my guaranteed alternative from John. If Bob doesn't come closer to this range, I'll likely need to take John's offer instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,500,000. Since this price equals John's offer, and we've already spent time negotiating with Bob, there's no advantage in continuing the negotiation or switching to John. Bob has finally met my minimum acceptable price, and it's best to conclude the deal now."
