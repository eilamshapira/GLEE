"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $2,500,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,500,000, it would be unwise to accept it. Buying from John for $1,500,000 is an option, but I'd like to try and negotiate with Alice first to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable, to leave room for negotiation. Since my maximum budget is $1,500,000, I'll start by offering a price that is substantially lower, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $2,000,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,500,000. While it's a step in the right direction, coming down from $2,500,000, it's still not within my acceptable range. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer, trying to meet somewhere closer to my budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $2,500,000 to $2,000,000, I'll meet her halfway between her last offer and my previous counteroffer of $1,000,000, and then slightly adjust to account for my budget constraint.

My new counteroffer will be $1,200,000, which is still below my maximum budget of $1,500,000 but shows a willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.

{""product_price"": $1,200,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $1,800,000 is getting closer to my budget, but it's still $300,000 above what I'm willing to pay, which is $1,500,000. At this point, I have to consider whether continuing to negotiate with Alice will yield a better result than just buying from John at $1,500,000.

Given that Alice has been willing to come down significantly from her initial offer, it's possible she may be willing to negotiate further. However, the gap between her current offer and my maximum budget is still substantial.

I'll reject Alice's offer again, but this time, I'll make a counteroffer that is very close to my maximum budget, to see if she's willing to meet me at or below that price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.
