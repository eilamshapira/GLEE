"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product's value, but my budget is quite limited. Would you consider a price of $700000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $700000 is below the minimum value I can accept for the product. I am willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I meet my minimum requirements. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1300000? This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and it reflects my willingness to work with you.",1300000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for the product. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
