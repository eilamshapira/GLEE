"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 300}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100). I don't know Bob's valuation, so I want to test the waters. A high initial offer allows me to gauge his interest and potential willingness to pay more.
*   **Profit Motive:** My goal is to maximize my profit, and I can always fall back on the $100 offer from John.
*   **Negotiation Room:** This high starting point provides ample room for negotiation and compromise in later rounds if needed."
