Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! The product sounds great, but I'm looking to save some money. Would you consider selling it to me for $9000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a good price, but I'm trying to get the best deal possible. Since I can buy the product from John for $12000, I'm willing to go up to $9750. I'm hoping to get it closer to the $9000 range. Can we meet at $9250?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer of $9,250 is a reasonable one, and it's getting close to the price I was initially thinking of. Considering that we're halfway through the negotiation rounds, I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too inflexible. Additionally, $9,250 is still a good price for me, and it's higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept. I think it's time to accept his offer and close the deal.
