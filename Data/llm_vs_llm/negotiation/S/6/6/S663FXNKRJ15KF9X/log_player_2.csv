"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product. I think you'd really like it! How about I offer it to you for $175? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $120 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering it for $175
3. John is willing to sell it for $120
4. If I accept Alice's offer, I would be paying $55 more than my maximum valuation
5. John's price matches my maximum valuation

Since Alice's offer ($175) is significantly higher than both:
- My maximum valuation ($120)
- John's alternative offer ($120)

The rational decision would be to buy from John.
