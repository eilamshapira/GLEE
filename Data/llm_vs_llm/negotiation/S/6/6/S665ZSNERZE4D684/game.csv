"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $125 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I think this would be a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to go down to $110 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you. Let's meet halfway!",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're trying to meet in the middle, but $110 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we settle at $95? This is close to your last offer and still within my budget. Let's make a deal!",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $95 is still just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair compromise, and I think we can close this deal.  What do you say?",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand where you're coming from, but $105 is still a bit over my budget. How about we agree on $100? This is the maximum I can go, and it's a round number that might work for both of us. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,8,
