"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product, I'll start by making a relatively high offer. This will give me room to negotiate and potentially settle on a higher price.

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is lower than the minimum value of $12,000 that I'm willing to accept, I will reject his offer.

Additionally, selling to John for $12,000 is a safer option, but I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can get a better price from him.

So, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $8,000, which is quite low, I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my initial offer of $20,000. This will show that I'm willing to negotiate and compromise.

My counteroffer will be:

{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's new offer of $9,000 is still lower than the minimum value of $12,000 that I'm willing to accept. While it's an improvement from his previous offer, it's not enough to convince me to sell.

Selling to John for $12,000 is still a safer option, but I'll give Bob another chance to increase his offer. I'll reject his current offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous one, to show that I'm willing to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""product_price"": 14000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I've already sent my counteroffer in the previous message. To reiterate:

{""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's new offer of $10,000 is still lower than the minimum value of $12,000 that I'm willing to accept. However, I can see that he's gradually increasing his offer, which suggests that he's interested in the product.

At this point, I'm starting to think that selling to John for $12,000 might be a better option, as it's a guaranteed sale and I won't have to risk going through more rounds of negotiation. Bob's offer is still $2,000 short of my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure if he's willing to meet me at that price.
