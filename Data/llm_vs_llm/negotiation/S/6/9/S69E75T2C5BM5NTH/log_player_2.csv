You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

Since both Alice and John are selling the product for the same price of $1,500,000, there is no difference in cost between accepting Alice's offer or buying from John.  Therefore, I will accept Alice's offer."
