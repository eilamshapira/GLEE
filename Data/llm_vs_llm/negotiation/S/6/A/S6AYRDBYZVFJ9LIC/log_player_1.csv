Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I'm looking to purchase the product at a lower price. How about $850000? This way, both of us can still make a profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
