"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm setting the initial price at $1200000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant return you'll see from it.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $800000 is certainly a respectable figure, it doesn't quite reflect the unique value proposition of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1100000. This offer takes into account market comparisons while still recognizing the distinct advantages this product offers.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that the product has a unique value proposition, but I still need to consider my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'll offer $950000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  I'm willing to move a bit further to encourage this deal. Let's say $1025000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and I believe it's a very attractive price for a product of this caliber.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you very close to your current offer. I'll offer $1000000, which is the highest price I'm comfortable paying for the product. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to close the deal immediately.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
