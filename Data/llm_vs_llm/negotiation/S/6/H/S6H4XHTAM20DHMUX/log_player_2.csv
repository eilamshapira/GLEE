"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm setting the initial price at $1200000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant return you'll see from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is above my budget of $1,000,000, I will reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still shows that I'm interested in the product. Since I don't know the value of the product to Alice, I'll start with a relatively low offer and see how she responds.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $800000 is certainly a respectable figure, it doesn't quite reflect the unique value proposition of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1100000. This offer takes into account market comparisons while still recognizing the distinct advantages this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,100,000 is still above my budget of $1,000,000. Since she was willing to come down from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, I'll try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous offer, but still below Alice's current offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but also emphasizes that I have a budget constraint.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that the product has a unique value proposition, but I still need to consider my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'll offer $950,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  I'm willing to move a bit further to encourage this deal. Let's say $1025000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and I believe it's a very attractive price for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,025,000 is still slightly above my budget of $1,000,000, but it's getting closer. Since she's willing to compromise and has moved significantly from her initial offer, I'll consider my next step carefully.

At this point, I have to weigh the benefits of negotiating further against the risk of losing the deal. Given that I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is still below Alice's current offer, I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to negotiate one last time.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is very close to my maximum budget, in the hopes of meeting Alice halfway. Since Alice has already compromised significantly, I'll try to find a mutually beneficial price.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you very close to your current offer. I'll offer $1,000,000, which is the highest price I'm comfortable paying for the product. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to close the deal immediately."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
