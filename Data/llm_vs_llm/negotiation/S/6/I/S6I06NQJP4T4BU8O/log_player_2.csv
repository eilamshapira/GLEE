"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: Pay $12,000 for the product
2. Reject Alice's offer: This would mean I don't get the product from Alice
3. Buy from John: Pay $15,000 for the product

The product is worth up to $15,000 to me. Alice is offering it for $12,000, which is $3,000 less than my maximum value and $3,000 less than John's price. This is a good deal that saves me money compared to buying from John.
