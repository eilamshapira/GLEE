"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $110 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",110.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $110. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm still confident in the product's value. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we settle at $130? I think this price reflects the product's worth and is a fair compromise.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $130. I'm still hesitant to go that high.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $120?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I would be happy to buy it immediately.",120.0,Bob,4,
