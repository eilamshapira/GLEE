"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny of $150, considering its quality and value. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $110 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $110 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I believe we can find a better middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $110. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm still confident in the product's value. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we settle at $130? I think this price reflects the product's worth and is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $130. I'm still hesitant to go that high.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $120?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I would be happy to buy it immediately. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $120 matches my minimum acceptable price and also matches the price I could get from selling to John, I see no benefit in continuing to negotiate or risking losing the sale. Accepting this offer ensures I meet my minimum requirement."
