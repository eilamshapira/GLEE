"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Let me think about this strategically.

Alice's offer is $14,000, but the product is only worth $10,000 to me. If I accept Alice's offer, I would be paying $4,000 more than what the product is worth to me, which doesn't make financial sense.

Jhon is offering to sell me the product for $10,000, which is exactly what the product is worth to me. This means I wouldn't save any money, but I wouldn't lose any either.

I could reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. Given that the product is worth $15,000 to Alice, she might be willing to sell for less than $14,000, but there's no guarantee she'll accept a counteroffer that's better for me than Jhon's price.

Since Jhon's offer matches exactly what the product is worth to me, and Alice's current offer would cause me to lose money, the most rational decision is:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}"
