"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to make a decision based on the information provided.

Alice is offering the product for $250, which is more than the $120 that John is offering and more than the $120 that the product is worth to me.

Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible and the product is only worth up to $120 to me, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer of $250.

I could try to negotiate with Alice by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer in the next round, but I already know I can get the product from John for $120, which is the maximum value to me.
