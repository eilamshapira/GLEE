"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth $100 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering it for $115
3. John is willing to sell it for $100

Since:
- Alice's offer ($115) is above my maximum value ($100)
- John's price ($100) exactly matches my maximum value
- I want to save as much money as possible

The logical choice is to buy from John, as it saves me $15 compared to Alice's offer and matches my maximum valuation.
