"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that's a bit too high for me. Considering I can get it from John for $100, I'm willing to pay $80 for your product.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but $80 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with. Let's meet in the middle; how about $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks, Alice. I appreciate the offer, but $110 is still more than I want to pay.  I'm willing to go up to $90, but that's my final offer.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $90 is still less than I hoped for, I'm willing to accept a compromise to close this deal.  How about $105? This is my final offer.",105.0,Alice,5,
