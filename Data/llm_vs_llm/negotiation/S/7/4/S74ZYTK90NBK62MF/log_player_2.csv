"Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's offer of $160 is significantly higher than the $80 maximum value the product has to you, and also higher than John's guaranteed price of $80, this offer doesn't make economic sense to accept.

I should either negotiate with Alice for a better price or buy from John. Since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum value ($80), I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. If negotiation fails, I can always fall back on John's offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $120 is still higher than the product's worth to me ($80) and higher than John's guaranteed price of $80. It doesn't make sense to accept this offer.

I'll reject Alice's offer and try one more counteroffer. If Alice doesn't come down to a reasonable price, I can always buy from John for $80.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $90 is still above John's guaranteed price of $80. Since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, and I can buy it from John for exactly $80, it makes economic sense to buy from John rather than accept Alice's offer of $90.
