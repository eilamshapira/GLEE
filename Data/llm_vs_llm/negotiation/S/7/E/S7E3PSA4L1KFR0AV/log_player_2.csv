"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to make a decision based on the information provided. 

Alice is offering the product for $2,000,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000. Paying this price would mean I'm losing value on the transaction.

John is willing to sell me the same product for $800,000, which is exactly my maximum valuation.

The logical choice is to reject Alice's current offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This gives me an opportunity to potentially get the product for less than $800,000, while I still have John's offer as a fallback option.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice that's well below my maximum threshold.
