"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since the offered price of $1,900,000 is significantly higher than the maximum value of $800,000 that the product is worth to me, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and explore other options.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. I'll offer $400,000, which is half of the maximum value I'm willing to pay.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,500,000 is still significantly higher than the maximum value of $800,000 that the product is worth to me. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $800,000, which is my maximum budget, I see no reason to accept Alice's offer.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and consider making another counteroffer, but I'm also getting closer to just buying from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer is still too high, I'll make another counteroffer. This time, I'll increase my previous offer of $400,000 to $600,000, which is still below my maximum budget of $800,000. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and pay a reasonable price, but I'm not willing to go above my budget.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,300,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000. While she is gradually decreasing the price, it's not coming down quickly enough to make it an attractive option for me.

At this point, I think it's more sensible to just buy the product from John for $800,000, which is my maximum budget. Continuing to negotiate with Alice may not yield a better price, and I risk wasting more time.
