"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Looking at the situation:

- The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me
- Alice is offering to sell it for $12,000
- I can buy it from John for $10,000

Alice's offer exceeds my maximum valuation, and it's also $2,000 more than John's price. Since I can get the same product from John at a price that matches my maximum valuation, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer or continue negotiating.
