Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. Since I know:
1. The product is worth at least $12,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $12,000
3. Bob's valuation is unknown, but if it's higher than $12,000, I should try to capture some of that value

I'll set a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price to test if Bob has a higher valuation, while still keeping it reasonable enough that it might be accepted.
