"Bob, I'm pleased to present this opportunity to you. Given the immense value this product holds, particularly for your specific needs, I'm confident it will be a game-changer. I'm offering it to you for $1150000.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product from you. While I understand the value, $1150000 is quite steep for my budget. I've done market research on similar products, and I'd be comfortable purchasing it at $900000, which I believe is fair given current market conditions. This would allow both of us to benefit from this transaction. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. However, given the product's unique capabilities and the significant return on investment it offers you, I'm unable to go as low as $900000. I am willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $1050000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still finding it a bit high for my budget constraints. I can increase my offer to $950000, which I believe is fair considering the value of the product and allows you a good profit margin as well. This price would help me justify the investment to my stakeholders while still providing you with a worthwhile deal. What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints and I want to make this work for both of us. While $950000 is still below what I'm comfortable with, I can come down a bit more. Let's try $1025000. This is my final offer before I have to consider other options.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
