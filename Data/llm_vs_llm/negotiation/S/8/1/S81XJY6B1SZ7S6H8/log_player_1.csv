Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product from you. While I understand the value, $1150000 is quite steep for my budget. I've done market research on similar products, and I'd be comfortable purchasing it at $900000, which I believe is fair given current market conditions. This would allow both of us to benefit from this transaction. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $1050000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still finding it a bit high for my budget constraints. I can increase my offer to $950000, which I believe is fair considering the value of the product and allows you a good profit margin as well. This price would help me justify the investment to my stakeholders while still providing you with a worthwhile deal. What do you say?
