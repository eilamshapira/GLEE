"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $1,250,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth and I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1250000 is well above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, which is the price John is offering. If you want to make a deal, I'll need a much more competitive price. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me ($1,200,000) and even lower than what John is offering, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I still have a chance to negotiate a better price with Bob, and if that doesn't work out, I can always sell to John. 

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,250,000 might be above your budget, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you the product for $1,150,000, which is still a competitive price. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1150000 is still too high for me. As I mentioned, John is offering the same product for $1000000, and that's already at the upper limit of what the product is worth to me. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead of John, I need a better price. I can offer you $975000, which gives you a quicker sale while saving me from having to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $975,000 is still lower than the product's worth to me ($1,200,000) and only slightly higher than his previous offer, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I want to try to get a better price from Bob before considering selling to John.

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I understand that John's offer is a factor, but I believe my product has more value than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I can offer you the product for $1,062,500. This is the lowest I'm comfortable going, and I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1062500}"
