Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,250,000 is well above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, which is the price John is offering. If you want to make a deal, I'll need a much more competitive price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 950000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1250000 might be above your budget, but $950000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you the product for $1150000, which is still a competitive price. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me. As I mentioned, John is offering the same product for $1,000,000, and that's already at the upper limit of what the product is worth to me. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead of John, I need a better price. I can offer you $975,000, which gives you a quicker sale while saving me from having to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 975000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975000. I understand that John's offer is a factor, but I believe my product has more value than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I can offer you the product for $1062500. This is the lowest I'm comfortable going, and I hope we can come to an agreement.
