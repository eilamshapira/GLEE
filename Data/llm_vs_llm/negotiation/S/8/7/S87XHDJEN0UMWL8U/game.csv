"Thank you for considering my counteroffer, Alice. I understand that we both have our target prices, but I would like to offer you $8000 for the product. I believe this price is more aligned with my budget and the market value.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob, but I cannot accept $8000 as it's significantly below the product's value. I can reduce my initial price to $12500, which I believe is still a fair offer considering the product's quality and market value.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12500 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $9000. I believe this price point is more reasonable for my budget and the market value. Would you be open to this?",9000.0,Bob,4,
