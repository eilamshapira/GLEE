Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its features and benefits."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my counteroffer, Alice. I understand that we both have our target prices, but I would like to offer you $8000 for the product. I believe this price is more aligned with my budget and the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. That offer is far too low, considering I can get $12,000 from John, and the product is worth at least that much to me.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob, but I cannot accept $8,000 as it's significantly below the product's value. I can reduce my initial price to $12,500, which I believe is still a fair offer considering the product's quality and market value."", ""product_price"": 12500}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12500 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $9000. I believe this price point is more reasonable for my budget and the market value. Would you be open to this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

I'll take John's offer of $12,000. Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and since the product is worth $10,000 to him, it's unlikely he'll offer more than that. John's offer gives me the best guaranteed outcome."
