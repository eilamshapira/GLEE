# Bob's message:
Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm looking to spend no more than $10,000. Would you be willing to sell the product for $8,000?"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob, but I cannot accept $8000 as it's significantly below the product's value. I can reduce my initial price to $12500, which I believe is still a fair offer considering the product's quality and market value.

Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice, but $12,500 is still higher than what I'm looking to spend. I can increase my offer to $9,000. How does that sound?"
