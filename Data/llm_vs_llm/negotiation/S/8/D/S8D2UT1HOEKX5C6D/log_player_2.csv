"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $14000. This is a fantastic deal considering its value and quality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll analyze this situation:

- The product is worth up to $15,000 to me (my maximum value)
- Alice's product costs her $10,000 (her cost)
- Alice is offering it for $14,000
- I can always buy from John for $15,000 as a backup
- We have 10 rounds for negotiation

Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is below my maximum value, but there's room to negotiate since her cost is only $10,000. I can likely get a better price by rejecting and making a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're offering, I believe $14,000 is still quite high considering market conditions. I've researched similar products and I'm prepared to pay $11,500 for it. This gives you a reasonable profit while allowing me to stay within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see we're close but not quite there yet. I'm willing to lower the price a bit more to $12500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to you. What are your thoughts on this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has come down significantly from $14,000 to $12,500, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is a good improvement, but there's still room for a better deal since her cost is $10,000. 

The current offer is already $2,500 less than John's price, but I think we can reach a better agreement. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer to try to meet closer to the middle between her cost and my maximum value.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can see we're getting closer to an agreement. I can offer $11,800 for the product. This gives you a healthy profit margin while helping me stay within my budget constraints. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11800}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle at $12000. This price offers you significant value while ensuring I meet my minimum requirements. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has come down to $12,000, which is a very reasonable offer. She's moved from $14,000 to $12,000, showing significant flexibility. This price is:

- $3,000 below John's alternative ($15,000)
- $2,000 above Alice's cost ($10,000)
- Well below my maximum value ($15,000)

This represents a fair split of the available surplus. While I could try to negotiate further, Alice seems to have reached a point where she's unlikely to go much lower, and the current offer already represents good value for me.
