"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that starting price is a little high for me. I see the value in this product, but I need a lower price point. How about we bring it down to $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $900000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with right now, I'm willing to come down a bit to keep negotiations moving. How about we meet in the middle at $1075000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer to my price range. To be honest, I have a strict budget for this purchase, and I can't go any higher than $950000. If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, $950000 is still a bit too low for me, but I understand you have a budget. This is a valuable product, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair return. Let's try $1025000. This is as low as I am willing to go for now.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm willing to budge a little to get this done. How about $975000? That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate you coming up a bit. I am almost at my bottom line, but I am still willing to negotiate with you. Let's meet at $1000000. That's my absolute final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
