"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I think it's worth at least $8000 to me, but I'm open to negotiation.  I'm offering it to you for $10000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I understand the value you see in the product, but I'm looking for something within my budget. How about $6500? I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $6500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer,  how about $8500? This would still allow me to get a fair price for the product, and hopefully, we can find a compromise that works for both of us. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
