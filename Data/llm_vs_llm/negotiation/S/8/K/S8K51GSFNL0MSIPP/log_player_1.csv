{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I think it's worth at least $8,000 to me, but I'm open to negotiation.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I understand the value you see in the product, but I'm looking for something within my budget. How about $6500? I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $6,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer,  how about $8,500? This would still allow me to get a fair price for the product, and hopefully, we can find a compromise that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
