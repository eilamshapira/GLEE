"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $6500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer,  how about $8500? This would still allow me to get a fair price for the product, and hopefully, we can find a compromise that works for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
