Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob
2. It's worth $1,000,000 to me (my minimum)
3. If Bob rejects, I can sell to John for $1,000,000
4. Bob knows I have another buyer (John)
5. The surplus (difference between Bob's value and my minimum) is $200,000

I want to capture most of the surplus while ensuring Bob still has some incentive to accept. If I price too close to $1,200,000, Bob might reject since he'd get almost no benefit. I'll set the price at $1,150,000, which:
- Gives me $150,000 of the $200,000 surplus
- Gives Bob $50,000 of the surplus
- Is significantly better for me than John's offer
- Still gives Bob enough incentive to accept
