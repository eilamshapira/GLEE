"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'll analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $150
2. John is also selling it for $150
3. The product is worth no more than $150 to me
4. My goal is to buy the product while saving money

Since Alice's price and John's price are identical ($150), and this is just Round 1, I should try to negotiate with Alice to get a better price. There's no advantage to accepting Alice's current offer or buying from John yet.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives room for negotiation while trying to get a better price than the $150 offered.
