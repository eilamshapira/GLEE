Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,000 is lower than the minimum value of $10,000 that the product is worth to me, and also lower than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

My counteroffer is: $14,500
