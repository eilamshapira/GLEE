"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $5000 for the product. This is a fair price considering current market conditions. Please let me know if this works for you.",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $5000 is significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. The product has unique features and quality that justify a higher price point. While I understand budget constraints, I can come down to $13500, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price better reflects the product's true market value and quality. Let me know if this works for you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
