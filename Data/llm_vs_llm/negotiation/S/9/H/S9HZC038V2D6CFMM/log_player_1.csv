Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $5000 for the product. This is a fair price considering current market conditions. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. The product has unique features and quality that justify a higher price point. While I understand budget constraints, I can come down to $13,500, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price better reflects the product's true market value and quality. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
