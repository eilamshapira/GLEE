"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product I'd like to offer you. Based on its market value and unique features, I'm offering it at $15000. This product has proven to be extremely valuable to its users, and I believe it would be a great investment for you. Let me know if you're interested at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I should reject this offer because $15,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000. It wouldn't make sense to accept an offer that would result in a loss. Additionally, since John is offering the product for $8,000, there's no reason to accept any offer from Alice that's higher than that amount.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer well below Alice's initial $15,000 but also leave some room for negotiation. Since I know I can get the product for $8,000 from John, I'll start significantly lower to have room for bargaining.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $5,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering current market conditions. Please let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 5000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $5000 is significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. The product has unique features and quality that justify a higher price point. While I understand budget constraints, I can come down to $13500, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price better reflects the product's true market value and quality. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's new offer of $13,500 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000). While Alice has reduced the price from her initial offer, it's still not competitive with my alternative option. Since I can get the same product from John for $8,000, and Alice's price is still $5,500 higher than that, the most logical decision is to buy from John.
