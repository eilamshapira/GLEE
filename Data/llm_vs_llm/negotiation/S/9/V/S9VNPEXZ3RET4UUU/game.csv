"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While the product sounds interesting, $200 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $160?  That's still a great deal considering the quality of this [product name].",160.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. $160 is still too high for me, though. I could do $100.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $100 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's split the difference and go with $130. It's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,
