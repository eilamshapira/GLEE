"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing [product name] and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $200, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","The offer is $200, which is much higher than my acceptable price of $120.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I value the product at $120, I will start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price to see how much room there is for negotiation.

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While the product sounds interesting, $200 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $80?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $160?  That's still a great deal considering the quality of this [product name]. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice came down from $200 to $160. It's still higher than my limit $120. I will reject the offer and continue to negotiate.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice came down a fair amount, so I'll increase my offer slightly, but still keep it well below my maximum of $120.

```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. $160 is still too high for me, though. I could do $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $100 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's split the difference and go with $130. It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has come down significantly, but $130 is still above my limit of $120. However, she says she's meeting me halfway, which suggests she might be close to her bottom price. I'm at round 5. Instead of making another counteroffer, I'll just buy from John for $120, since it's within my budget and saves me potential further negotiation.

```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```"
