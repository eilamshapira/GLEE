Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price to offer Bob for my product. I know the product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at exactly that price if Bob rejects my offer.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I need to make a strategic decision. If I price too high, Bob might reject it and I'll end up with my minimum $15,000 from John. If I price reasonably above my minimum value, I have a chance to make more profit.

A reasonable approach would be to offer a price that gives me a good profit margin while still potentially being attractive to Bob. I'll offer a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but not so extreme that it would instantly be rejected.
