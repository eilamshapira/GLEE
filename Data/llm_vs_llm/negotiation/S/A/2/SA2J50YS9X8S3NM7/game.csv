,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $280 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $50. I believe it's a fair price considering I can also buy it from John for $80.",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand budget constraints. However, $50 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $220.",220.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $220 is still a bit steep for me. Considering I can buy the product from John for $80, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
