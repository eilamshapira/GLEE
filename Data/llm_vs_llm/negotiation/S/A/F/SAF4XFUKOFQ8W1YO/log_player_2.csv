"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Given the options and the situation:

*   **Accept Alice's offer:** You pay $1,700,000. This is a bad deal because the product is only worth $1,000,000 to you.
*   **Reject Alice's offer:** You can try to negotiate with Alice, but there's no guarantee you'll get a better price.
*   **Buy from John:** You pay $1,000,000. This is the best option because it gets you the product for its maximum worth to you.

Therefore, the best decision is to buy from John.
