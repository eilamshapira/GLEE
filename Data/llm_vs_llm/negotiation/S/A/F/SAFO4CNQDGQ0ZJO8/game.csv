"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. While I understand you have a budget in mind, $12000 is the absolute minimum value of this product to me. Given its quality and features, I believe a fair price would be $15500. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true value. Would you be able to meet me at this price?",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price from your initial offer. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Considering your last offer and my initial counteroffer, I'd like to propose a middle ground of $13500. I believe this price is more in line with my budget while still acknowledging the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",13500.0,Bob,4,
