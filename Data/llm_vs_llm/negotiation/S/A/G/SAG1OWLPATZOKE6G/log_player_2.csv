"Alice's offer: The product price will be $799,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $799,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to think about this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering the product for $799,999, while John's price is $800,000.

Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $1 cheaper than John's offer, it makes financial sense to accept Alice's offer.
