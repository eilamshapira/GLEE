Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this exclusive product, which truly embodies exceptional quality and value. I'm prepared to sell it for $1,200,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $1200000 is significantly above my budget. The market value for similar products is actually around $700000, and I already have an alternative offer from another seller at $800000. However, I value potentially working with you, so I'm willing to offer $650000 for the product. This gives you a reasonable profit while allowing me to stay within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
