Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my options carefully. 

The product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at this price.
Bob values the product at $1,200,000, which means any price above that would cause him to reject my offer.

Since I have a guaranteed buyer at my minimum acceptable price, I'll start by offering Bob a price close to his maximum valuation, but with some room for potential negotiation.
