Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a reasonably high offer while leaving room for potential negotiation if needed.

{""product_price"": 1,800,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This offer of $200,000 is far too low, significantly below even my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, and Bob's offer is so far below this, it would be best to end the negotiation with Bob and take the sure deal with John.
