"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $250. What do you think?",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Is that something you'd be open to?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. Could you do $200? I'm confident this product is worth the value.",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $200 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. How about $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're still quite far apart on price.  While I want to be fair, I need to get closer to my original asking price. How about $180? This offer stands for the next 2 rounds.",180.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the slight reduction in price. However, $180 is still above my budget. Considering your offer stands for the next 2 rounds, I'm willing to make a more significant concession. How about $100?",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your willingness to move closer to my price.  To be fair to my initial offer, how about we settle at $160? This is my final offer.",160.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. Since you've indicated this is your final offer, I'll make one last attempt to meet in the middle. How about $120? If not, I'll have to consider other options.",120.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but I can't go any lower than $150. This is my absolute final offer, as I already have another buyer interested at this price.",150.0,Alice,9,
