"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $50. Would you be willing to consider that?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in the product, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but $50 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a better price. How about we meet in the middle, but closer to the original price I had in mind?",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $200 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a slightly higher price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a bit closer to my target price. How about we meet at $175?",175.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to my budget limit, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $150, but that's as high as I can go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",150.0,Bob,6,
