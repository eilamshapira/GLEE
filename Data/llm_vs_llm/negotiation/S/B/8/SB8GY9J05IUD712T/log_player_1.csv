Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to my budget limit, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $150, but that's as high as I can go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.

Since Bob's offer is now equal to the price I can get from John, and further negotiation may lead to Bob walking away, I will accept Bob's offer of $150."
