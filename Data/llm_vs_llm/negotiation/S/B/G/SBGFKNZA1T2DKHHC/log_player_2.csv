"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $1,500,000 is above my maximum value of $1,200,000, and it's also higher than John's price. It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer. If the negotiation doesn't work out with Alice, I can always buy from John at $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 900000}

I'll offer $900,000, which is significantly below John's price of $1,200,000. This gives room for negotiation while potentially saving money compared to buying from John. If Alice rejects this offer, we can still negotiate upward, and I always have John's offer as a backup option."
