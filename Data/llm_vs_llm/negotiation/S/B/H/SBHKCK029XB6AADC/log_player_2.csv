"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,425,000 is less than my maximum budget of $1,500,000, I am willing to consider it. However, I also know that the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, which means she has some room to negotiate. 

Given that I want to save as much money as possible, I don't want to accept the offer immediately without trying to negotiate a better price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is slightly above this value, but still significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $1,425,000. This will give us room for further negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has made a concession by reducing the price from $1,425,000 to $1,375,000, which is a positive sign. However, I still believe I can get a better deal since the product is worth $1,200,000 to her.

Accepting the offer of $1,375,000 would save me $125,000 compared to buying from John, but I'm willing to try to negotiate further to see if I can get an even better price.

Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is a viable option, as it may prompt Alice to reduce the price even further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has already reduced the price from $1,425,000 to $1,375,000, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one, but still lower than Alice's current offer. This will show that I'm willing to compromise, but also try to get the best possible deal.
