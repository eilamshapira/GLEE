"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a product that I believe has significant value. This is a premium product with exceptional quality and features. I've had interest from other buyers, including a confirmed buyer named John who is ready to purchase it for $800000. However, I wanted to give you the first opportunity to acquire it. Based on the market value and the product's capabilities, I'm offering it to you for $950000. This product represents an excellent investment opportunity with substantial potential returns. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
