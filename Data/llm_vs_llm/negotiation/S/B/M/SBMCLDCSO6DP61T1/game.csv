"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6000, considering the market value and my own financial constraints.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $6000 is too low, I am willing to come down a bit. How about $14000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down from your initial offer. However, $14000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about $10000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, We are getting closer! $10000 is still a little low for me, considering its value to you is $8000. Let's try $13000.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that we're getting closer, but $13000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I need you to consider my constraints. How about $11000? It's a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",11000.0,Bob,6,
