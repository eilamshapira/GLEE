"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is at the very top of my budget. I can also get this product from John for the same price, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a better price. Would you consider $12000 for the product?",12000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the value of the product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $14000. What do you think?",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
