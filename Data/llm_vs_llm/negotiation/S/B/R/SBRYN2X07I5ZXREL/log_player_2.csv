"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to make a decision about Alice's offer. Let me analyze the situation:

Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which is exactly the same price as John's offer. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me.

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer immediately. I could try negotiating with Alice to get a better price than $15,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is at the very top of my budget. I can also get this product from John for the same price, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a better price. Would you consider $12,000 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. Given your budget concerns, I'm willing to lower the price to $14000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it represents a fair value for both of us. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has now offered the product for $14,000, which is $1,000 less than John's price of $15,000. This is a better deal than John's offer, and it's also below the maximum value of $15,000 that the product is worth to me.

I could try to negotiate further, but Alice has already made a significant concession from her initial price. I'm now being offered a price that saves me $1,000 compared to my alternative option.
