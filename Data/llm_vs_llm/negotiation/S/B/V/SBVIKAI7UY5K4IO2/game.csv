"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling me this product, but $25000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $12000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it for exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $8000 for the product, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $8000 is significantly below the value of this product. Given our conversation, I am willing to meet you closer to your budget. How about we agree at $20000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for coming down in price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $20000 is still well above what I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I have a firm offer from another seller for $12000, which is actually the maximum value this product has to me. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price than that. I can offer $10000, which would give you a sale today and save me a bit compared to my alternative option. Does that work for you?",10000.0,Bob,4,
