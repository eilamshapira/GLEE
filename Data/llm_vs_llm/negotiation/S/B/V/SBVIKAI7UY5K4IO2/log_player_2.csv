"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I believe this product would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $25000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's offer of $25,000 is much higher than the maximum of $12,000 that the product is worth to me, and it's also significantly higher than John's guaranteed price of $12,000. There's no reason to accept this offer.

I should either reject and counter, or buy from John. Since John's price is exactly my maximum valuation of $12,000, I would prefer to negotiate with Alice to see if I can get a better price. Let me reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling me this product, but $25,000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it for exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $8,000 for the product, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $8000 is significantly below the value of this product. Given our conversation, I am willing to meet you closer to your budget. How about we agree at $20000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has lowered her price from $25,000 to $20,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but this is still significantly above my maximum valuation of $12,000 and higher than John's price of $12,000. 

There's no reason to accept this offer since I can get the same product from John for $12,000, which would save me $8,000. I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a price below John's $12,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for coming down in price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $20,000 is still well above what I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I have a firm offer from another seller for $12,000, which is actually the maximum value this product has to me. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price than that. I can offer $10,000, which would give you a sale today and save me a bit compared to my alternative option. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
