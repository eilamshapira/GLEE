"Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Based on the information provided, I should evaluate my options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: This would cost me $17,000
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John for $15,000

Since the product is only worth $15,000 to me, accepting Alice's offer of $17,000 would mean I'm paying more than the product's value to me. 

John is offering the product at exactly $15,000, which matches the maximum value I place on the product.

The most rational decision is to buy from John rather than accept Alice's above-value offer.
