"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $12,000, and also higher than John's guaranteed price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and also below John's price of $12,000. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to John's offer.

{""product_price"": 8000}

This offer is reasonable because:
1. It's well below John's price of $12,000, giving me potential savings
2. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial $20,000, but not insultingly low
3. It leaves room for negotiation upward if needed
4. If Alice rejects this, I still have several rounds to negotiate or can fall back on John's offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $17,000 is still significantly higher than John's price of $12,000, and higher than my maximum value of $12,000. There's no reason to accept this offer when I have a guaranteed better option with John. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round, moving closer to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $20,000 to $17,000, showing some flexibility, I'll increase my previous offer but still stay well below John's price to maintain room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 9500}

This counteroffer is strategic because:
1. It shows movement from my previous offer of $8,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate
2. It's still significantly below John's price of $12,000, giving me potential savings
3. There's still room for further negotiation if needed
4. If Alice rejects this, I still have several rounds remaining and John's offer as a backup"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $15,500 is still higher than both John's price ($12,000) and my maximum value ($12,000). While Alice is showing continued willingness to negotiate by reducing the price further, there's still no reason to accept this offer when I have a guaranteed better option with John. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, bringing us closer to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has shown a pattern of reducing her price (from $20,000 to $17,000 to $15,500), so I'll continue negotiating by raising my offer accordingly.

{""product_price"": 11000}

This counteroffer is strategic because:
1. It's a significant increase from my last offer of $9,500, showing I'm seriously negotiating
2. It's still below John's price of $12,000, maintaining potential savings
3. It's getting closer to what might be an acceptable middle ground
4. We still have a few rounds left if needed, and John's offer remains as a backup
5. The larger increase in my offer might signal to Alice that I'm willing to make a deal, but only at a price below $12,000"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John for $12,000. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer of $14,000 is still above John's price of $12,000
2. While Alice has been gradually lowering her price, the rate of decrease suggests we might not reach below $12,000 in the remaining rounds
3. Even if we did reach a price close to $12,000, it wouldn't provide significant savings over John's offer
4. There's a risk of losing negotiating momentum or Alice becoming less flexible
5. Since $12,000 is my maximum value for the product anyway, securing it at this price from John is a reasonable outcome"
