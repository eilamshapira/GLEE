"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Considering Bob's offer and the constraint of needing at least $12,000, I have to make a strategic decision.

My options are:

*   **Accept Bob's offer:** This guarantees I sell the product and make the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's safe, but I might be leaving money on the table.
*   **Reject Bob's offer and counter:** This keeps the negotiation going. I could potentially get a higher price, but I risk Bob walking away, and I also risk losing the chance to sell to John.
*   **Sell to John:** This guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price.

Since I have multiple rounds remaining and I want to maximize my profit, I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed with a counteroffer.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Okay, here's my analysis:

*   **Accept Bob's offer:** This gets me a profit above my minimum, and it's a sure sale.
*   **Reject and counter:** I might get a better price, but I risk Bob walking away, and I risk losing the sale altogether.
*   **Sell to John:** Guarantees my minimum.

Given that the offer is already above my minimum, and I'm already in round 4, I should accept.

```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
