"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $15,000, and also higher than John's guaranteed price. It would be better to reject this offer and make a counteroffer to Alice in the next round, as there's potential to get a better deal than John's $15,000 price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 12000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $12,000. This price point is strategically chosen because:
1. It's well below John's price of $15,000, giving room for negotiation upward
2. Since Alice's initial offer was quite high ($20,000), starting low gives us space to meet somewhere in the middle
3. If Alice accepts, I'll save $3,000 compared to buying from John
4. If Alice rejects, we still have several rounds to negotiate and can gradually increase the offer if needed"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has only reduced her price by $2,000 (from $20,000 to $18,000), and it's still higher than John's guaranteed price of $15,000. Since we still have several rounds of negotiation left, it makes sense to reject this offer and continue negotiating. The fact that Alice was willing to lower the price suggests there's room for further negotiation. In the next round, I'll make another counteroffer that's higher than my previous one but still below John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 13500}

I'll increase my counteroffer to $13,500. This is a strategic move because:
1. It shows meaningful movement from my previous offer of $12,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate
2. It's still $1,500 less than John's price, maintaining potential for savings
3. By moving up $1,500, I'm showing Alice that I'm serious about making a deal
4. If Alice rejects, we still have rounds remaining to continue negotiating
5. The gap between our positions has decreased (from $18,000 to $13,500), which might encourage Alice to make a more reasonable counter"
