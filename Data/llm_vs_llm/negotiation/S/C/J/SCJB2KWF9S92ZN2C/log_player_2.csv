Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $1,800,000, and my previous counteroffer was $500,000, I'll try to meet her halfway, but still keep my budget in mind.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $1,500,000, and I've already offered $700,000, I'll try to split the difference between my previous offer and Alice's last offer. However, I'll also keep in mind that I have a better alternative with John's offer of $800,000. I'll offer $750,000, which is closer to my maximum budget and shows that I'm still willing to negotiate, but not willing to go much higher.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer is $1,400,000, which is still significantly above my budget of $800,000. At this point, I think it's clear that Alice is not willing to meet me at a price that I'm comfortable with. Given that I have a better alternative with John's offer of $800,000, I think it's time to consider walking away from the negotiation with Alice.
