"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $9500. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $9500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's a price that still allows me to make a profit. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
