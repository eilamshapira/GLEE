Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $9500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's a price that still allows me to make a profit. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Alice is getting closer, but $11,000 is still too high.  I'll counter with a slightly higher offer."
