Send your offer to Bob.,"Since I know the product is worth $80 to Bob and $100 is my minimum acceptable price, there's no point in starting with a very high price. However, I'll start slightly above my minimum to leave room for negotiation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since I know I can sell to John for $100, and Bob's offer of $70 is below both my minimum acceptable price ($100) and even below his own valuation ($80), I should either counter-offer or sell to John. Given that Bob's first offer was quite low and there's a guaranteed $100 from John, the safest choice is to sell to John.
