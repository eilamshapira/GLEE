"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I should analyze Alice's offer carefully. She's offering the product for $1,400,000, while I know it's worth $800,000 to her. That means she's trying to make a $600,000 profit. I can buy from John for $1,500,000, but Alice's offer is already $100,000 better than that.

Since I value the product at no more than $1,500,000, Alice's offer is within my acceptable range. However, I believe I can negotiate a better price since there's still a large gap between her cost ($800,000) and her asking price ($1,400,000).

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. We have 10 rounds total, so there's plenty of time to negotiate.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but gives me a better deal. Alice's product is worth $800,000 to her, so I'll offer significantly above that value but well below her initial asking price of $1,400,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has reduced her price from $1,400,000 to $1,300,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is a $200,000 savings compared to John's price of $1,500,000. However, knowing the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, there's still room for negotiation.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer. We've only used 3 of our 10 rounds, so there's still plenty of time to reach a better agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer to show Alice I'm willing to compromise, but still aim for a price that gives me good value.

{""product_price"": $1,100,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has reduced her price again from $1,300,000 to $1,250,000. She's moving in smaller increments now ($50,000 compared to the previous $100,000 reduction), which suggests she's getting closer to her reservation price. The current offer saves me $250,000 compared to John's price.

We're now at round 5 of 10, so we're halfway through our negotiation window. There's still room to negotiate, but I also need to be mindful that we need to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer that moves closer to Alice's position.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a more substantial increase to my offer, showing Alice that I'm serious about reaching an agreement while still trying to get a good price.
