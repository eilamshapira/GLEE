Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. Since the product is worth $15,000 to me, I'm leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to compromise, as he values the product at $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's significantly below my minimum value of $15,000 and even less than his own perceived value of $10,000. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $13,000. This is still above my minimum value, but it's a significant compromise from my previous offer. I hope this shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to give away the product for a huge loss."
