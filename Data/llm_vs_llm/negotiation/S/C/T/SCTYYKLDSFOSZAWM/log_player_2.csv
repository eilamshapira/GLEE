"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's alternative price ($10,000). It would be irrational to accept this offer when I have a better alternative. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 8000}

I'll start with a relatively low offer of $8,000. This gives room for negotiation while staying below my maximum value of $10,000. Since I know I can always get the product from John for $10,000, I want to try to secure a better deal from Alice. The offer is also not unreasonably low considering Alice's cost of $15,000, which shows I'm not trying to lowball too aggressively."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer ($13,000) is still higher than John's price ($10,000) and my maximum value ($10,000), it makes more sense to take John's offer. While Alice has lowered her price significantly from the initial offer, there's no guarantee she will go below $10,000, especially since the product is worth $15,000 to her. Rather than continuing the negotiation with uncertainty, I'll take the guaranteed option of buying from John at $10,000."
