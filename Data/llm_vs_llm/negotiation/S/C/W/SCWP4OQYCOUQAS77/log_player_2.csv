"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $1,200,000
2. Alice's asking price is $1,100,000
3. I know Alice's cost is $800,000, so there's room for negotiation
4. I have 10 rounds to negotiate
5. John's offer of $1,200,000 is my fallback option

Given that Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is significantly above her cost ($800,000), and I have plenty of negotiation rounds left, it makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer. I can likely get a better price through negotiation, and I always have John's offer as a backup.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's between Alice's cost ($800,000) and her initial offer ($1,100,000). Given that Alice needs to make a profit and considering typical negotiation strategies, I'll start relatively low but not insultingly low:

{""product_price"": 900000}

This offer:
1. Is $100,000 above Alice's cost, giving her a reasonable profit
2. Leaves room for negotiation
3. Is significantly below her initial offer, but not so low as to seem unreasonable
4. Gives us room to move up while staying well below the $1,200,000 maximum"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a good development:

1. Alice has moved down from $1,100,000 to $1,000,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. The price is $200,000 less than my maximum ($1,200,000)
3. It's $200,000 above Alice's cost, giving her a reasonable profit
4. While we might get a slightly better price with more negotiation, we risk:
   - Alice moving back up in price
   - Potentially losing time and ending up with John's higher price

Given this analysis, $1,000,000 represents a fair deal that saves me $200,000 compared to John's offer. The potential benefit of further negotiation doesn't outweigh the risk.
