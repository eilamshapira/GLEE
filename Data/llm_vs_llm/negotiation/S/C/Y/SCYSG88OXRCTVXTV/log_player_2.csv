"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I would like to offer you this fantastic product for $100. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to evaluate this offer based on my goal of buying a product worth no more than $80 to me while saving as much money as possible.

Alice is offering the product for $100, which is:
1) Above my maximum value for the product ($80)
2) More expensive than John's offer ($80)

Since I can get the same product from John for $80, which matches my maximum valuation, and saves me $20 compared to Alice's offer, the logical choice is to buy from John.
