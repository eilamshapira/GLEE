Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a price to offer to Bob that maximizes my expected profit. Since I know the product is worth at least $80 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, my minimum acceptable price is $80.

I should set a price higher than $80, since that's my fallback option. However, I don't want to price it so high that Bob will likely reject it. Without knowing Bob's valuation, I'll choose a moderate markup that gives me a good profit if accepted while not being unreasonably high.
