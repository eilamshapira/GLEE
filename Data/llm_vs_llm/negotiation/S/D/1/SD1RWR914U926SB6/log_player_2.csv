"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than your alternative option (buying from John for $1,200,000). It's highly unlikely the product is worth $2,000,000 to you given your constraints.  It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 800000}

This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still gives room for negotiation. It signals that I'm serious about buying but need a price that reflects the product's true value to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice came down significantly, $1,750,000 is still too high. I need to show I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1000000}

This counteroffer shows Alice I'm willing to move closer to her price, but I'm still seeking a significant discount. By staying under my budget, I maintain leverage in the negotiation."
