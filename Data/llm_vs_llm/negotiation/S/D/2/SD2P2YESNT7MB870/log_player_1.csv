Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,000 is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 and also lower than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer. However, since Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product, I believe there's room for negotiation to get a better price. Therefore, I will proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

My counteroffer is $11,500. 

Please let me know Bob's response.
