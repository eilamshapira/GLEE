"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $12500 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to offer $10000 for the product instead. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter offer. While I understand budget considerations, $10000 is lower than I can accept for this product. Given its value and quality, I can come down to $11500, which is already a significant discount from my initial offer. This represents excellent value for a product that will serve you well. Would you be able to meet me at this price?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $11500 is still a bit too high for my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10500 for the product. Can we meet at this price?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the improved offer. I've considered it carefully, but I need to be closer to my target value for this product. I can come down to $11000 as my final offer. This is a fair price that recognizes both your budget constraints and the true value of what you're receiving. Would this work for you?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but $11000 is still slightly above what I'm willing to spend. I would like to propose $10800 as my final counteroffer for the product. Can we agree on this?",10800.0,Bob,6,
