"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The rational choice is to buy from John for $10,000 because:
1. Alice's offer ($15,000) is higher than my maximum valuation ($10,000)
2. John's offer ($10,000) equals my maximum valuation
3. I will save $5,000 by buying from John compared to Alice's offer"
