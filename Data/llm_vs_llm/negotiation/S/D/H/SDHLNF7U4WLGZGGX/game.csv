"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $600000. I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. However, I cannot sell it for $600000. How about we settle on a price of $1800000? I believe it's a fair value considering the benefits it can bring you. Let me know your thoughts!",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming back with a new proposal. I appreciate the reduction in price, but $1800000 is still above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $700000. I believe this is a reasonable price, taking into account the value I expect to get from the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your latest offer. However, $700000 is still too low for me. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. How about I offer it to you for $1500000? I believe this is a fair price based on the product's true value. Looking forward to hearing back from you!",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I value your persistence in this negotiation and understand your budget constraints. However, I can't accept $750000. Let's try a different approach.
