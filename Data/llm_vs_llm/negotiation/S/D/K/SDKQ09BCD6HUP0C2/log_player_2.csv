"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it for $1800000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than John's price. It makes sense to negotiate and see if we can get a more reasonable price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price seems a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for the product. What do you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to gauge Alice's reaction and leave room for negotiation.
* **Not Too Low:** While aiming low, $500,000 is still a substantial offer that might be tempting for Alice.
* **Polite and Open:**  The message keeps a friendly tone to encourage continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product is worth more than that. How about I lower my price to $1600000? I think it reflects the true value of the product. Let me know! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice reduced her price, it's still significantly higher than our target and John's offer. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price, but it's still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000. I hope this demonstrates my serious interest in the product."",
 ""product_price"": 650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're making a significant jump from our initial offer but keeping it well below both Alice's current offer and our maximum budget.
* **Showing Interest:** By increasing our offer, we're demonstrating to Alice that we're serious about purchasing the product but also that we're not willing to overpay.
* **Still Below John:**  We remain well below John's $800,000 offer, providing a safety net if negotiations fall through."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I can't go that low. How about I adjust my price to $1500000? I believe this is a fair compromise considering the productâ€™s value. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's price is coming down, but it's still far too high. We'll continue negotiating, but we're getting closer to the point where John's offer becomes more appealing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me. To be completely transparent, I have a budget of around $800,000 for this product. If you're able to come down to a price close to that, we have a deal. Otherwise, I may need to explore other options."",
 ""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Urgency:**  We're being upfront about our budget and the possibility of walking away, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Final Offer (Almost):**  We're presenting our maximum budget, leaving minimal room for further negotiation. We're signaling that this is our best offer unless Alice dramatically changes her price.
* **John is Backup:** We're prepared to walk away and take John's offer if Alice doesn't agree."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your transparency, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. However, I can't go as low as $800000. How about we settle at $1400000? I believe this is still a reasonable compromise. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It seems Alice is unwilling to come close to our budget. While she might reduce the price a bit more, it's unlikely to be worth the further negotiation. Buying from John for $800,000 is the best option now, as it guarantees us the product at our target price."
