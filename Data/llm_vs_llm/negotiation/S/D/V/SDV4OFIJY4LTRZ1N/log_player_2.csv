"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I am prepared to offer you this exclusive product for $1000000. This is a unique opportunity, so please let me know if you are ready to proceed. Otherwise, I will be selling it to another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to me and Alice's offer is exactly $1,000,000, I don't see any benefit in rejecting the offer or buying from John, as the price would be the same.
