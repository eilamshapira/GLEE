"Hello Alice, thank you for your concession and revised offer. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $1200000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider alternative options. I'm looking forward to your response.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer and for being transparent about your budget constraints. I appreciate your willingness to stretch to $1200000. However, I'm still not quite at a price that I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1550000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the product's value. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to explore other options. I look forward to your response.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
