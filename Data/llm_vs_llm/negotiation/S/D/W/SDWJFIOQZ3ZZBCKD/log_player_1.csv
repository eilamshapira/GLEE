Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $1,700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth and I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I understand that the product has exceptional value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe this price is more reasonable considering my budget and the market value of similar products. I'm looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me ($1,500,000) and even lower than the product's worth to Bob ($1,200,000), I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I believe there is still room for negotiation to reach a mutually acceptable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,650,000.

I'm open to further negotiations and look forward to your response."", ""product_price"": 1650000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still lower than the product's worth to me ($1,500,000) and the product's worth to Bob ($1,200,000). I believe that accepting this offer would be selling the product for less than its true value. Since there are still several rounds left in the negotiation, I will reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer in an attempt to reach a more mutually beneficial price."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your concession and revised offer. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $1200000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider alternative options. I'm looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Although Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to the product's worth to him, it is still $300,000 less than the product's worth to me ($1,500,000). Given that Bob has stated this is the highest he is willing to go, I'm not optimistic that further negotiations will result in a significantly better offer. However, I'm not ready to give up on the negotiation yet. I will reject Bob's offer and make one more counteroffer to try to squeeze out a bit more value. If that doesn't work, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000."

Round 7

I appreciate your willingness to stretch to $1,200,000. However, I'm still not quite at a price that I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,550,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the product's value. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to explore other options. I look forward to your response."", ""product_price"": 1550000}"
