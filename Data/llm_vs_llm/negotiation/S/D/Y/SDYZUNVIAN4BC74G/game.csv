"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to sell it to you for a competitive price. I've taken into consideration the product's worth and I'm starting with a price that reflects its value.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $6000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12000 might be out of your budget, but $6000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? I believe this price reflects the product's value more accurately.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7000. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $7000. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I still need to get a bit closer to its actual value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. This is a significant reduction from my previous offers, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $9500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $7500. This is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you.",7500.0,Bob,6,
