Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to sell it to you for a competitive price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $6000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually beneficial price. My counteroffer will be $11,000. This price is still below my initial offer but closer to the value I believe the product holds, and it's also above the price John is willing to pay, which gives me a bit of leverage in the negotiation. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 might be out of your budget, but $6,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I believe this price reflects the product's value more accurately."", ""product_price"": 11000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7000. Let me know if this is something we can work with.

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since Bob has increased his offer to $7,000, it shows he's interested in the product and willing to negotiate. I'll try to meet him closer to the middle but still ensure I get a price that's closer to my minimum of $10,000. My next counteroffer will be $9,500.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $7,000. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I still need to get a bit closer to its actual value.

Bob's offer:

Since Bob's final offer is $7,500, which is below my minimum acceptable price and the offer from John, I've decided to sell the product to John for $10,000. This ensures I get a price that meets my requirements without further prolonging the negotiation with Bob."
