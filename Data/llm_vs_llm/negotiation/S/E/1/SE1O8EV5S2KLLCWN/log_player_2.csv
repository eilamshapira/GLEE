"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze this offer:

Alice's offer: $14,999
John's offer: $15,000
Maximum I'm willing to pay: $15,000

Alice's offer is $1 cheaper than John's offer, so I would save a minimal amount by accepting her offer. While the savings are very small, there's no reason to reject Alice's offer since it is within my budget and cheaper than my alternative.
