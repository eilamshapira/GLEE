Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to sell it to you at a competitive price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to counter with $9000. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,000 is lower than my initial offer and also lower than the minimum amount I'm willing to accept ($10,000), I will reject Bob's offer. However, I still see potential in negotiating with Bob since he's interested in the product and his budget might be flexible. Therefore, I will proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Considering your interest in the product, I'd like to counteroffer at $11,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I hope it's more in line with what you're looking for."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9500. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $9,500 is still lower than I'm comfortable with, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Since Bob is willing to negotiate and has increased his offer, I see an opportunity to meet in the middle. However, selling to John for $10,000 is still an option that guarantees me a price that I'm willing to accept.

Given that Bob's latest offer is $9,500 and my minimum acceptable price is $10,000, I will reject Bob's offer once more and try to counteroffer again, aiming to meet closer to my minimum price or slightly above it, considering Bob's willingness to increase his offer.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $9,500. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. We're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. Considering your latest offer and my desire to find a middle ground, I'm willing to slightly reduce my previous counteroffer. I'd like to propose a price of $10,200. This is a compromise that takes into account your budget constraints while also reflecting the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 10200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $10200. I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $9800? I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $9,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but it's very close. Given that we've been negotiating for several rounds and Bob has consistently increased his offer, it shows that he's interested in the product and willing to pay a significant amount for it.

At this point, I have to weigh the potential of getting a higher offer from Bob against the certainty of selling the product to John for $10,000. Since Bob's latest offer is only $200 away from my minimum acceptable price, I'm inclined to try and negotiate one more time to see if we can meet at or above $10,000.

We're very close to a deal, and I'm eager to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering your latest offer and my minimum acceptable price, I'd like to propose a final compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I believe we can conclude the deal satisfactorily.
