Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","I'll reject Bob's offer since it's below my minimum acceptable value ($800,000) and even below John's guaranteed offer. I'll continue negotiating with Bob since there might be potential to get a better price than John's $800,000.
