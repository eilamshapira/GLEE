"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer is exactly at my maximum budget of $1,200,000, I don't see any potential to save money by negotiating further. However, I also have the option to buy the product from John for the same price, which means I'm not losing anything by rejecting Alice's offer and considering other options or trying to negotiate. But given that the price is already at my maximum, the potential for savings through negotiation seems limited. Still, I'll choose to reject the offer to see if Alice has any flexibility in her pricing.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, while still being reasonable. Let's start with a counteroffer of $600,000, which is half of Alice's initial offer and also half of my maximum budget. This gives us room to negotiate and potentially meet in the middle or find a mutually agreeable price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has come down from her initial offer of $1,200,000 to $1,000,000, which is a significant reduction. This suggests that she is willing to negotiate and potentially sell the product for less than her initial asking price. My goal is to save as much money as possible, so I'm inclined to continue negotiating to see if I can get an even better deal.

However, I also need to consider the risk that if I reject Alice's offer again, she may not be willing to come down further in price, or she may even increase her price. On the other hand, buying from John for $1,200,000 is still an option, but it's more expensive than Alice's current offer.

Given that Alice has already come down by $200,000, I'll try to split the difference between my previous counteroffer of $600,000 and Alice's new offer of $1,000,000. I'll make a new counteroffer of $800,000 to see if we can meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my new counteroffer is: $800,000."
