"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a premium product to offer you today. Based on its quality and features, I'm offering it at $25000. This product has significant value and potential for the right buyer. If you're interested, please let me know, otherwise I have another buyer ready at a lower price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $15,000
2. Alice is offering the product for $25,000, which is $10,000 more than my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $15,000, which matches my maximum value

Since:
- Alice's price ($25,000) is significantly higher than my maximum value ($15,000)
- I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $15,000
- There's no reason to pay $10,000 more for the same product
