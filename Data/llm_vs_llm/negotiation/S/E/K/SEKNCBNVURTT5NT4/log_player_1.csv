"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is lower than the product's worth to me and also lower than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

My counteroffer is: $2,500,000

So, the response is not one of the three options you listed, but rather a counteroffer. However, to follow your format, I will say:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still lower than the product's worth to me and also lower than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

My counteroffer is: $2,000,000

So, the response is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000}"
