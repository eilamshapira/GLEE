"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $120.
2. John is also selling the product for $120.
3. The product is worth no more than $120 to me.

Since both offers are at the maximum amount I value the product, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer over buying from John. However, I could potentially negotiate a better price with Alice by making a counteroffer in the next round.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice at a lower price to try to get a better deal than the $120 alternative from John.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I see that Alice has countered with $110, which is $10 less than both her original offer and John's price. This is a better deal than the $120 alternative, but I'll try one more round of negotiation to see if I can get an even better price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has now offered $105, which is $15 less than John's price. This is a good improvement from her previous offers. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might not lower the price more or might become frustrated. Since $105 is already a significant savings compared to the $120 alternative, I'll accept this offer.
