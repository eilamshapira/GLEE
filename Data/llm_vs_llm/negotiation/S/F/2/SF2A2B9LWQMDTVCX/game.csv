"Hello Bob! I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it for $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I need to let you know that I can get the same product from another seller for $100. I'd like to give you the opportunity to make the sale, but I can't pay more than what I can get elsewhere. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product, which would still give us both a good deal. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you can get it for $100 elsewhere, but my product comes with exceptional quality and reliability. Given that, I can offer it to you for $120, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. This is still a fair price considering the value you'll receive.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice. However, I'm still not seeing the value in paying $20 more than I can get the identical product elsewhere. If there are specific features or benefits your product has that others don't, please let me know. Otherwise, I can offer $90, which still gives you a reasonable profit while saving me some money compared to my alternative. If we can't agree, I'll need to go with the other option I have at $100.",90.0,Bob,4,
