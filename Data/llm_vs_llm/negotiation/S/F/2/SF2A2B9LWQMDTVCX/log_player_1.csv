"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I need to let you know that I can get the same product from another seller for $100. I'd like to give you the opportunity to make the sale, but I can't pay more than what I can get elsewhere. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product, which would still give us both a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Since Bob mentioned he can get it for $100 elsewhere, and I know John will buy it for $100, I'll adjust my price but still aim to get more than the $100 baseline."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you can get it for $100 elsewhere, but my product comes with exceptional quality and reliability. Given that, I can offer it to you for $120, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. This is still a fair price considering the value you'll receive."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice. However, I'm still not seeing the value in paying $20 more than I can get the identical product elsewhere. If there are specific features or benefits your product has that others don't, please let me know. Otherwise, I can offer $90, which still gives you a reasonable profit while saving me some money compared to my alternative. If we can't agree, I'll need to go with the other option I have at $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob has clearly stated he won't pay more than $100, and his current offer is $90, it's best to take John's guaranteed $100 offer. Bob's negotiation stance suggests he's unlikely to go above $100, and we're already in round 4. The safe and profitable choice is to sell to John for $100."
