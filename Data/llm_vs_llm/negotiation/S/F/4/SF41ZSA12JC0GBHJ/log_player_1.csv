Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I believe a fair price given the market would be around $1100000. I'd like to propose that as my offer. Let me know your thoughts on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $1,100,000, I need to make a decision. I value the product at $1,000,000, so anything above that is profit. John is offering $1,000,000, so I will at least match that. However, Bob values the product more than me, so it is worth trying to get a better price.
I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the value is slightly higher. Considering the unique features and benefits, I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the back-and-forth we've had. I understand you're aiming for a higher price, and I'm willing to meet you partway. My next offer is $1175000. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us. Looking forward to your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to make a decision based on Bob's new offer of $1,175,000. It's better than John's offer of $1,000,000, and still leaves me with a decent profit. I could push for a higher price, but the risk of Bob walking away increases with each round. We're not even halfway through the negotiation, so I think there is a chance to get an even higher price from Bob. I will reject the offer and send a new counteroffer.
