"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Given the information:
- The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me (Bob)
- Alice is offering to sell it for $1,900,000
- John is willing to sell the same product for $1,500,000

Alice's offer ($1,900,000) exceeds the maximum value I place on the product ($1,500,000), and it's also higher than John's price ($1,500,000).

The logical choice is to buy from John at the lower price that matches my maximum valuation.
