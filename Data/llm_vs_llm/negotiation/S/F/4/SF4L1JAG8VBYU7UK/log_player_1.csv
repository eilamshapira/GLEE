Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $150 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since the product is worth no less than $100 to me, I wouldn't want to sell it for $90. However, I also don't want to lose the opportunity to sell it to Bob, who has shown interest in the product. Selling it to John for $100 is a safe option, but I might be able to get a better price from Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm afraid I couldn't go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle at $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
