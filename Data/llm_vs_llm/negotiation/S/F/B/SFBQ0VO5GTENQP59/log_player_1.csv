"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $280. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 280}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $280 is above my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I can still negotiate for a better price than John's offer.

{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. However, I cannot go that low. The quality and value of this product justifies a higher price. I can offer it to you for $240. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 240}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. However, I cannot go that low. The quality and value of this product justifies a higher price. I can offer it to you for $240. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 240}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I have a firm budget of $150. Would you consider selling the product for $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $150 since:
1. It matches my minimum acceptable price
2. It's the same as what John is offering
3. There's no guarantee I can negotiate a higher price, and continuing negotiation risks losing the deal entirely"
