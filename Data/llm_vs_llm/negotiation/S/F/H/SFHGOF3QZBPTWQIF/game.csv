"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I believe $1400000 is a bit above my budget. After considering the product's value and market conditions, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1000000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1000000 is significantly below the product's market value. I already have another buyer willing to pay $1200000, but I believe we can reach a deal that benefits both of us. Given that this product would provide substantial value to your business, I'm willing to reduce my initial price to $1350000. This represents a $50000 reduction from my first offer while still ensuring good value for both parties.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for sharing the information about the other buyer. I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price to $1350000. However, I still believe that we can reach a better agreement. Given the product's value and the fact that you have another buyer willing to pay $1200000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1250000. This price is closer to the other buyer's offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
