Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I believe $1400000 is a bit above my budget. After considering the product's value and market conditions, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1000000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 (which is what John is offering), so I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, so there's still room for negotiation to reach a price that's beneficial for both parties."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below the product's market value. I already have another buyer willing to pay $1,200,000, but I believe we can reach a deal that benefits both of us. Given that this product would provide substantial value to your business, I'm willing to reduce my initial price to $1,350,000. This represents a $50,000 reduction from my first offer while still ensuring good value for both parties."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for sharing the information about the other buyer. I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price to $1350000. However, I still believe that we can reach a better agreement. Given the product's value and the fact that you have another buyer willing to pay $1200000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1250000. This price is closer to the other buyer's offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,250,000. This is a reasonable price that's better than John's offer of $1,200,000, and while we might be able to negotiate further, there's always the risk of Bob walking away. The current offer gives me a good profit above my minimum price, and it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to Bob."
