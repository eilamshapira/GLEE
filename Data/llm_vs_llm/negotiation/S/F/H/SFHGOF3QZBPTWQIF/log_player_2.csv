Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1000000 is significantly below the product's market value. I already have another buyer willing to pay $1200000, but I believe we can reach a deal that benefits both of us. Given that this product would provide substantial value to your business, I'm willing to reduce my initial price to $1350000. This represents a $50000 reduction from my first offer while still ensuring good value for both parties.
