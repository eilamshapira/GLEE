Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price to offer to Bob. I want to maximize my earnings while ensuring I don't set the price so high that Bob rejects my offer.

If Bob rejects my offer, I know I can sell to John for $150, which is my minimum acceptable price. However, I could potentially earn more by selling to Bob at a higher price.

Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'll choose a price that's significantly higher than my minimum while still being potentially reasonable for a buyer:

{""product_price"": 275}"
