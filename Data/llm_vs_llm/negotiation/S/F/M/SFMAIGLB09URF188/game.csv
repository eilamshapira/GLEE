"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest, but I cannot go as low as $1000000. How about we meet in the middle at $1100000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. Could we possibly settle at $1050000? I think this would be a great deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your continued interest, Bob. While $1050000 is closer to what I'm aiming for, I would like to propose a price of $1075000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
