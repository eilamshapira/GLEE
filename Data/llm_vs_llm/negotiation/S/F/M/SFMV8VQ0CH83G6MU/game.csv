"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1100000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product, given its value to me. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $950000, but it's still below what I believe is fair value for this product. Given its quality and the value it would bring to you, I can offer it at $1025000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial price and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1025000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $975000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
