"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its market value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. This price reflects the product's quality and long-term value."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1100000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product, given its value to me. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. While $950,000 is better than selling to John, there's still room for negotiation since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $950,000, but it's still below what I believe is fair value for this product. Given its quality and the value it would bring to you, I can offer it at $1,025,000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial price and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1025000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your position, but $1025000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $975000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $975,000. While we could continue negotiating, this is a good price that's well above my minimum threshold of $800,000, and Bob has shown limited movement in his counteroffers. There's a risk that prolonging the negotiation might lead to deteriorating offers or Bob walking away, leaving me with only John's $800,000 option."
