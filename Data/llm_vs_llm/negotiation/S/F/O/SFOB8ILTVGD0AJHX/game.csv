"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $9500.

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'd like to propose a price of $12200. This is the lowest I'm comfortable going, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",12200.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still above my budget. Considering your last offer, I'd like to propose a price of $10500, but then I realized I can get it from John for 10000. So I will meet you in the middle of that which is $10250. If you are not willing to sell for this price I will have to go with John. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",10250.0,Bob,6,
