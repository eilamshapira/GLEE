Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still above my budget. Considering your last offer, I'd like to propose a price of $10500, but then I realized I can get it from John for 10000. So I will meet you in the middle of that which is $10250. If you are not willing to sell for this price I will have to go with John. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.

It seems that Bob is trying to negotiate in bad faith by mentioning that he can get the product from John for $10,000, which is not true since I am the one who has the option to sell to John for $12,000. Given this, I don't think it's worth continuing the negotiation with Bob, and I'll choose to sell the product to John for the higher price."
