"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I should not accept Alice's offer of $1,800,000 because it exceeds the maximum value of $1,500,000 that the product is worth to me. Since John is willing to sell the product for exactly $1,500,000, which matches my maximum valuation, it makes the most sense to buy from him rather than continue negotiations with Alice (whose starting point is already too high).
