Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high offer, but leave some room for negotiation while ensuring it's above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.

{""product_price"": 11,500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","I'll reject Bob's offer since it's too close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. While it's better than John's offer, I think I can get a better price from Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

And I'll follow up with a new counteroffer of $11,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still gives me a good profit margin.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 11,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","I'll accept Bob's offer of $10,750. This is a reasonable compromise as it's significantly better than John's offer of $10,000, and we've already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation. Continuing to negotiate might risk Bob walking away, leaving me with only John's lower offer. The $10,750 represents a decent profit above my minimum price.
