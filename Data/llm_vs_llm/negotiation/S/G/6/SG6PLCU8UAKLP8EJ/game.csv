Hello Bob! I have this excellent product that I'm willing to offer you at $160. It's a high-quality item that I believe would be very valuable to you. Let me know if you're interested in purchasing it at this price.,160.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $160 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. How about $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest, but $60 is too low for me - that's less than half of what the product is worth to me. I can come down from my initial offer though. How about $130? This is still a good value considering the quality of the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I am sorry, but $130 is still too high for me. I can increase my offer to $65",65.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand we're trying to find a price that works for both of us. However, $65 is still significantly below what this product is worth to me. I need at least $120 for this product. Given that's my absolute minimum, I can offer it to you at $125, which is a substantial reduction from my original price.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort in reducing the price, but $125 is still far from what I am willing to pay. I can raise my offer to $70.",70.0,Bob,6,
