Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest, but $60 is too low for me - that's less than half of what the product is worth to me.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand we're trying to find a price that works for both of us. However, $65 is still significantly below what this product is worth to me.
