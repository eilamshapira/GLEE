"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me think about this:
1. The product is worth no more than $120 to me
2. John's fixed price is $120
3. Alice's offer is $100
4. Alice's cost is $80, so there's room for negotiation
5. We have 10 rounds to negotiate

Since Alice's offer ($100) is already better than John's price ($120), and there's still room for negotiation, I should try to get a better price from Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Let me make a strategic counteroffer:
1. Alice's cost is $80
2. Her initial offer was $100
3. I should aim for a price that's reasonable but lower than $100
4. Starting with a lower offer gives room for negotiation

I'll offer $85, which gives Alice a small profit but is significantly better for me than her $100 offer.

{""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice has dropped her price from $100 to $90
2. This is already $30 less than John's price
3. We're making progress in the negotiation
4. Alice's cost is $80, so she's still making a $10 profit
5. While we might get a slightly better price, the risk of prolonged negotiation might not be worth the small potential savings

Given that $90 is a reasonable price (it's $30 less than my alternative option and only $10 above Alice's cost), I'll accept this offer.
