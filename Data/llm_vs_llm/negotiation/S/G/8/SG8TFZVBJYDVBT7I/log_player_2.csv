"Alice's offer: The product price will be $149. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $149
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to consider if Alice's offer is better than buying from John.

Alice is offering the product for $149, which is $1 less than John's price of $150.

Since the product is worth no more than $150 to me, and Alice's offer allows me to save money compared to buying from John, I should accept Alice's offer.
