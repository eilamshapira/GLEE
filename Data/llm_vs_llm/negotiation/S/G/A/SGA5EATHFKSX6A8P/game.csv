"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think $140 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy the product for $100. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $100 is a little lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still think $125 is a bit high. I'd be willing to meet you closer to the middle at $110. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Okay Bob, $110 is still a bit low, but I understand your perspective. How about $120? That's as low as I can reasonably go.",120.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, but I'd like to propose $115 as a compromise. I think this is a fair price considering our previous discussions.",115.0,Bob,6,
