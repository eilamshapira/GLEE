Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer and the quality of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would be able to purchase the product for $750000. Let me know if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and even below John's guaranteed offer, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer. I know I can always fall back on John's $800,000 offer, so there's no reason to accept anything lower than that."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. Given the product's value and quality, I can reduce my initial asking price to $1,000,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents excellent value for this product. Would you be able to meet this price?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
