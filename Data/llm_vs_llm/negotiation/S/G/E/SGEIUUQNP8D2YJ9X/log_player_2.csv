"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product, which I believe perfectly aligns with your interests. I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let's discuss the terms. I'm willing to sell it to you at a price that reflects its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $2,500,000, which is more than my maximum budget, I will reject Alice's offer. Additionally, I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within my budget.
