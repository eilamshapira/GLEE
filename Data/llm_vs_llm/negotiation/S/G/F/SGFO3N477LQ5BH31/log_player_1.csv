Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Considering my goal is to maximize profit and the product is worth at least $120 to me, I need to make a decision. I'll analyze each option:

*   **(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60:** This is a loss. I'd make a profit of -$60 (60-120).

*   **(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer:** This gives me a chance to negotiate a higher price.

*   **(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120:** This gives me a profit of $0 (120-120).

Since I have the chance to negotiate and a guaranteed sale at $120, I will continue to negotiate with Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, I'll make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Let's re-evaluate my options:

*   **(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70:** This results in a loss of $50 (70 - 120).
*   **(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer:** This still gives me a chance to negotiate, but Bob seems unwilling to increase his offer significantly.
*   **(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120:** This is a guaranteed profit of $0 (120-120).

Given the history of offers, and the fact that I can sell the product to John for $120, it's likely that further negotiation with Bob won't be fruitful. I need to maximize my profits, and John's offer is better than anything Bob is offering at the moment.
