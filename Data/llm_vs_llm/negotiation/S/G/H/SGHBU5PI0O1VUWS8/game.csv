"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, I have to consider the product's inherent value and the effort it took to acquire. I can't go down to $1000000. How about we meet in the middle at $1100000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Meeting in the middle is a good idea, but I was thinking more of meeting in the middle between my previous offer of $1000000 and your initial offer of $1150000. That would put us at $1075000. I'm willing to pay that, but I'm not sure I can go much higher.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand. $1075000 is tempting, but I still believe the product's worth is a bit higher. I'm willing to split the difference one last time. How about $1087500? This is my final offer.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
