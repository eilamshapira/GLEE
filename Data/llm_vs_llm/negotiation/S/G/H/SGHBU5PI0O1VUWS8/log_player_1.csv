Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this exclusive product. Considering its value to you and its unique nature, I'm willing to let it go for $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Given Bob's counteroffer, I have to make a decision. I could sell to John for $1,000,000, but that would mean I am not earning any profit. I also do not want to sell for $1,000,000 because that will not earn me any profit.

My best option is to continue negotiating.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, I have to consider the product's inherent value and the effort it took to acquire. I can't go down to $1,000,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Meeting in the middle is a good idea, but I was thinking more of meeting in the middle between my previous offer of $1000000 and your initial offer of $1150000. That would put us at $1075000. I'm willing to pay that, but I'm not sure I can go much higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","This is a tough one. Bob is clearly trying to drive the price down. I could accept his offer of $1,075,000, which would give me a profit, but I still think I can get a bit more. The risk is, if I push too hard, Bob might walk away. My other option is to sell to John, which nets me $1,000,000.

I'm going to try one more counteroffer.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand. $1,075,000 is tempting, but I still believe the product's worth is a bit higher. I'm willing to split the difference one last time. How about $1,087,500? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1087500}"
