"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $18000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations if you're interested.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18000 is significantly above my budget and what I believe is a fair market value for this product. I can actually get the same product from another seller for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. Would you consider $8500? This would give me a reason to choose you over other sellers.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your honest feedback and for considering doing business with me. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given the product's value and the fact that you mentioned a market value of $10000, I'm willing to make a concession. I can offer the product to you for $14000, which is below my initial price but still reflects the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,
