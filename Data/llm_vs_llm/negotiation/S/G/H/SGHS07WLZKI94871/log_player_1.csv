"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18000 is significantly above my budget and what I believe is a fair market value for this product. I can actually get the same product from another seller for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. Would you consider $8500? This would give me a reason to choose you over other sellers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I will make a counteroffer to Bob. Given that he mentioned being able to get the product from another seller for $10,000 but prefers to do business with me, I sense there's room for negotiation. My counteroffer will be lower than my initial price but higher than Bob's offer, taking into account his budget concerns and the mentioned market value.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your honest feedback and for considering doing business with me. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given the product's value and the fact that you mentioned a market value of $10,000, I'm willing to make a concession. I can offer the product to you for $14,000, which is below my initial price but still reflects the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
