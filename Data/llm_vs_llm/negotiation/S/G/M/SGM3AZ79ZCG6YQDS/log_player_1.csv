Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Okay, I need to decide whether to accept Bob's $130 offer, counter with a new offer, or sell to John for $120.

Considering my options:

*   **Accept Bob's offer ($130):** This gives me a profit of $10 ($130 - $120 cost).
*   **Sell to John ($120):** This gives me a profit of $0 ($120 - $120 cost).
*   **Reject and counteroffer:** This could potentially lead to a higher price from Bob, but also risks him walking away or driving the price down further.

I think I can get more than $130 from Bob.
