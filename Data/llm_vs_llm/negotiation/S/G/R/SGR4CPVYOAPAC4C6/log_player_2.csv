"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer. I will not buy from John yet, as I want to try to negotiate a better price with Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is reasonable and closer to my target price. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll offer a price that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still shows that I'm interested in buying the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,050,000 is still above my budget of $800,000. While it's a slightly better offer than her initial one, it's still not a good deal for me.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to negotiate a better price. Since Alice is willing to lower her price, I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer that is still below my maximum budget of $800,000. Since Alice has already lowered her price to $1,050,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between her new offer and my previous counteroffer of $900,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,025,000 is still above my budget of $800,000. While she's getting closer to a reasonable price, it's still not a good deal for me.

At this point, I think it's clear that Alice is not willing to sell the product to me at a price that I'm comfortable with. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $800,000, which is within my budget, I think it's time to stop negotiating with Alice and explore other options.
