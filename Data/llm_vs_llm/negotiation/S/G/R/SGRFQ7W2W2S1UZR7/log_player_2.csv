"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $13,500 is close to my maximum budget of $15,000, but I still have room to negotiate, I'll choose to reject the offer and make a counteroffer to try and get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I don't know Alice's bottom line, I'll start with a price that is closer to what I think the product might be worth to her, which is $8,000, but also taking into account that I'm willing to pay up to $15,000.

My counteroffer will be $10,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $12,000 is a $1,500 reduction from her previous offer, which shows that she's willing to negotiate. However, I still think I can get a better price.

Since my maximum budget is $15,000 and Alice's new offer is $12,000, I'll reject this offer and try to make another counteroffer to see if I can get an even better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","In Round 2, I offered $10,000, and Alice rejected it. Then, she came back with a counteroffer of $12,000 in Round 3. This suggests that she's willing to negotiate, but she's not willing to go as low as $10,000.

To try and find a mutually acceptable price, I'll make a new counteroffer that's higher than my previous offer of $10,000, but still lower than Alice's current offer of $12,000.

My new counteroffer will be $11,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $11,500 is only $500 more than my previous counteroffer of $11,000. This suggests that we're getting close to a mutually acceptable price.

Considering that my maximum budget is $15,000, and Alice's new offer is $11,500, I'm starting to think that this might be a good price. However, I'll try to squeeze out one more concession from Alice.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, but this time, I'll make it closer to Alice's current offer.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's current offer is $11,500, and my previous counteroffer was $11,000, I'll try to meet her halfway.

My new counteroffer will be $11,250.
