"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $150 is a bit too expensive for me. I'm willing to buy the product for $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to go down to $120 for the product. What do you think?",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand $150 was too high for you. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer the product for $120. Let me know if that works for you.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $120 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $70 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to accept.",70.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I see that $120 is still too high for you. I can come down to $110, but that's the lowest I can go while still making a reasonable profit. What do you say?",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. How about $110? This is the lowest I can go while still making it worthwhile for me. Let me know if this works for you.",110.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $110 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and John's price. I can offer $75 for the product.",75.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your attempt to find a middle ground. However, $75 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $105, which is very close to John's offer but still allows me some profit. What do you think?",,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're close but not quite there yet. I can lower the price to $105, which is just above John's offer but still gives me a small profit. Would you be willing to accept this price?",105.0,Alice,7,
