"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $100
2. My maximum value for the product is $120
3. John's fixed price is $120
4. If I reject, I can make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal

Alice's offer of $100 is already $20 less than my maximum value and John's price. While I could try to negotiate for an even lower price by making a counteroffer, there's a risk that Alice might increase her price in subsequent rounds. The current offer of $100 is reasonable and provides me with $20 in savings compared to buying from John.
