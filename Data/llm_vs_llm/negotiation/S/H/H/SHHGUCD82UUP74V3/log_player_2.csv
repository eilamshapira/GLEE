"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this exclusive product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits and its worth to you, I'm willing to let it go for $14000. This is a one-time opportunity, and I am confident you will benefit greatly from this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to consider this carefully. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me. Alice is offering it for $14,000, which exceeds its value to me. Meanwhile, John is offering the same product for $8,000, which matches the maximum value I place on it.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and John's offer is $6,000 less than Alice's, the logical choice is to buy from John.
