"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. After considering the uniqueness of the product and my own valuation, I'd like to start the negotiation at $500000. I believe this is a fair opening point and hope we can find common ground from here. Looking forward to your response.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but your offer is significantly below its true value and my initial expectations. While I'm always open to negotiation, I need to see a willingness to move closer to a realistic price point. Considering this, I'm proposing a revised price of $1250000. This feels like a fair compromise, allowing us to move forward constructively.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
