"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to make a decision that maximizes my utility. The product is worth no more than $80 to me, and John is offering it at exactly $80.

Alice's offer of $200 is significantly higher than the product's value to me and higher than John's alternative offer. There's no reason to accept Alice's current offer.

I could try to negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, but since I already have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $80 (which is the maximum I value the product at), the rational choice is to simply take that option.
