Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150, I will reject his offer.

Also, since selling to John for $150 is a better option than selling to Bob for $100, I will not consider selling to John at this point, but rather try to negotiate a better price with Bob.

So, my decision is to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","My counteroffer to Bob is to sell the product for $180.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and also below the price that John is willing to pay, I will reject his offer.

I will also not sell to John yet, as I want to try to negotiate a better price with Bob.

So, my decision is to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I will send a new counteroffer to Bob: $170.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and also below the price that John is willing to pay, I will reject his offer.

At this point, I'm not getting closer to my target price, and Bob's offers are not increasing significantly. Selling to John for $150 is starting to look like a better option.

However, I'll try one more time to negotiate with Bob. If he's not willing to meet me at a reasonable price, I'll sell to John.

So, my decision is to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I will send a new counteroffer to Bob: $160.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $118 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and also below the price that John is willing to pay, I will reject his offer.

At this point, I've tried negotiating with Bob several times, and his offers are not increasing significantly. I'm not getting closer to my target price, and it's clear that Bob is not willing to meet me at a reasonable price.

Selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed sale at a price that is acceptable to me, whereas continuing to negotiate with Bob may not yield a better result.

So, my decision is to stop negotiating with Bob and sell the product to John.
