"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to consider the best financial decision here.

Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is exactly what it's worth to her. However, this price exceeds the maximum value of $800,000 that the product is worth to me.

John (spelled ""Jhon"" in the options) is offering the same product for $800,000, which matches exactly what the product is worth to me.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and John's offer is $200,000 cheaper than Alice's, the logical choice is to buy from John.
