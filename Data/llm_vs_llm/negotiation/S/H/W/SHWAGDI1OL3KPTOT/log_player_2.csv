"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","The offer from Alice is $14,000, which is higher than the $12,000 the product is worth to me. It's also higher than John's guaranteed price of $12,000. I should either reject and make a counteroffer, or buy from John directly.

Since I have the opportunity to negotiate and potentially get a better price than John's $12,000, I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly below Alice's price but not so low that it would be immediately rejected.

{""product_price"": $10,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice lowered her price to $13,500, which is still higher than both the $12,000 the product is worth to me and John's guaranteed price of $12,000. Since John is offering a better price at $12,000, there's no reason for me to accept Alice's current offer.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer, trying to get her below John's price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $11,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has lowered her price to $13,000, but this is still higher than John's guaranteed price of $12,000. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible while getting the product, and John's offer is better than Alice's current offer, I should either reject and continue negotiating or buy from John.

Let me try one more round of negotiation with Alice to see if I can get her to offer a price below $12,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $11,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has lowered her price to $12,750, but this is still higher than John's guaranteed price of $12,000. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, and John's offer is better than Alice's current offer, I should either reject and continue negotiating or buy from John.

Since we've been through several rounds already and Alice's price is still above John's, and there's no guarantee Alice will go below $12,000, the rational choice is to buy from John.
