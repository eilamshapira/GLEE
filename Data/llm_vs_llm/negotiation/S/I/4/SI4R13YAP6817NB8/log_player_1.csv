```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Considering the value of the product to Bob and my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price. While I can't go as low as $900,000, I am willing to come down a bit. How about:

```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
