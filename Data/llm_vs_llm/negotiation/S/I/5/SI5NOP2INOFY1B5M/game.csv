"Hi Bob, I have a great product here that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140.",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $140 is more than the product is worth to me. I know the same product is available elsewhere for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I'm willing to offer $80 for the product. What do you say?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $80 is too low. I'm happy to negotiate, but I can't go that low. How about $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still more than I can justify spending. Keep in mind that I can purchase this product from another seller for $100. However, I'd rather do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. I can go up to $90 for the product. How does that sound?",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your position, and I appreciate you wanting to do business with me. Let's meet in the middle a bit more. How about $120?",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I see we're making progress in our negotiation, which I appreciate. However, $120 is still more than I can pay, especially considering I have an option to buy the exact same product for $100 from another seller. I value building a business relationship with you, so I'll increase my offer to $95. This is very close to my maximum budget, but it allows you to make a sale and me to save a little compared to my alternative option.",95.0,Bob,6,
