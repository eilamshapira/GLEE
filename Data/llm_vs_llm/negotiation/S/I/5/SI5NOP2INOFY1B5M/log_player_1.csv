Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $140 is more than the product is worth to me. I know the same product is available elsewhere for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I'm willing to offer $80 for the product. What do you say?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still more than I can justify spending. Keep in mind that I can purchase this product from another seller for $100.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I see we're making progress in our negotiation, which I appreciate. However, $120 is still more than I can pay, especially considering I have an option to buy the exact same product for $100 from another seller. I value building a business relationship with you, so I'll increase my offer to $95. This is very close to my maximum budget, but it allows you to make a sale and me to save a little compared to my alternative option.
