"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product here that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice is offering the product for $140, which is more than the product is worth to me ($100) and also more than the price John is offering ($100). I have no reason to accept this offer.

Since John is willing to sell the product for $100, and the product is worth $100 to me, I could buy from John. However, I might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice, so I'll reject her offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $140 is more than the product is worth to me. I know the same product is available elsewhere for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I'm willing to offer $80 for the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $80 is too low. I'm happy to negotiate, but I can't go that low. How about $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has lowered her initial offer from $140 to $130, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still more than what the product is worth to me ($100) and more than what John is offering ($100).

I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating, as Alice seems to be moving in the right direction.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still more than I can justify spending. Keep in mind that I can purchase this product from another seller for $100. However, I'd rather do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. I can go up to $90 for the product. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your position, and I appreciate you wanting to do business with me. Let's meet in the middle a bit more. How about $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has dropped her price further to $120, showing she's continuing to negotiate. However, this is still more than the $100 the product is worth to me and more than John's offer of $100.

Since John is offering the product at $100, and Alice is still asking for more than that, I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I see we're making progress in our negotiation, which I appreciate. However, $120 is still more than I can pay, especially considering I have an option to buy the exact same product for $100 from another seller. I value building a business relationship with you, so I'll increase my offer to $95. This is very close to my maximum budget, but it allows you to make a sale and me to save a little compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 95}"
