"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to make a decision based on the offers available and my goals.

Alice is offering the product for $12,000, but the product is only worth up to $10,000 to me. John (or Jhon as mentioned in the options) is willing to sell me the same product for $10,000.

Since I want to save as much money as possible while still getting the product, and John's offer is both within my valuation limit and $2,000 cheaper than Alice's offer, the logical choice is to buy from John.
