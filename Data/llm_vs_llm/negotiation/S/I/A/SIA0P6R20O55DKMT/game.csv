"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $15000 is significantly above my budget. I'm looking at a price point of $6000, which is what similar products are going for in the market. I should mention that I have another seller offering the same product for $8000, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $6000 is significantly lower than the product's value, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle at $10000. This price reflects the unique features and benefits of this product, and it allows us to both get a good deal. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for being flexible, Alice. I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10000 is still above my budget. John is offering the same product for $8000, but I'd prefer to work with you. To make it worth my while to choose you over him, I'd need a better price. I can offer $7000, which gives you a better deal than walking away without a sale, and gives me some savings compared to my alternative option.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your situation and your desire to save money.  While $7000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still not comfortable with that price. How about we split the difference and settle at $8500?  That's a fair price that gives you a significant discount while ensuring I can make a reasonable profit. Let's close the deal, I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",8500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. We're getting closer, but I need to be practical about this purchase. John is offering the exact same product for $8000 firm, and that's already at the top of my budget. For me to choose you instead, I'd need a price of $7500. This is my best offer - it gives you a sale today rather than losing the business completely, and gives me a small incentive to choose you over the alternative I already have lined up.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I want to make this deal work.  $7500 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $8000?  This price reflects the value of the product while also allowing you to get a great deal. It's a win-win scenario for both of us. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,7,
