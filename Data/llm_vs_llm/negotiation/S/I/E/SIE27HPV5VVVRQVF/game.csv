"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $6000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $6000 is significantly lower than the value I place on this product. I'm willing to come down to $15000, considering your interest. Let's find a middle ground.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $15000 is still quite high for me. I can offer $7500 for the product. Would you consider that?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $7500 is still far below the value I've placed on this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11250?  This price reflects the value it holds and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",11250.0,Alice,5,
