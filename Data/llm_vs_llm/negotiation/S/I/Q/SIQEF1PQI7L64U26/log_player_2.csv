"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this unique product at $8000. Given its quality and value, I believe this is an excellent opportunity. Let me know if you're interested in making the purchase at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since Alice's initial offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay ($8,000), and I know I can get the same product from John for the same price, I don't see a need to accept the offer immediately without trying to negotiate a better price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in hopes of getting a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable, to see how she responds. Since the product is worth $8,000 to me, I'll start by offering a price that is substantially lower, aiming to negotiate upwards from there.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $5,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 5000}"
