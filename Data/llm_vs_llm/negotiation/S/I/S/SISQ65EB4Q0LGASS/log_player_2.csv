"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is above the $8,000 upper limit of what the product is worth to me. Since I can buy the same product from John for $8,000, which is within my valuation range, I should choose that option.
