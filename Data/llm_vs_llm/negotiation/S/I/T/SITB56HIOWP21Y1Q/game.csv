"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I see a lot of value in the product, but to make this work on my end, I'd like to propose a price of $1050000. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, the price of $1050000 is below our minimum threshold. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer. How about we settle at $1100000? This is a fair compromise and still represents significant value for you.",1100000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. How about we agree on $1075000? This price reflects a significant concession on my part while still ensuring you get a great deal.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
