"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love. Given its high quality and value, I'm pricing it at $95. I believe it's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll agree.",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks Alice, but I think $95 is a bit high. I'm thinking of something more around $65. How does that sound?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $65 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $90. I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from Alice, but $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $75. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $75. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $85. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",85.0,Alice,5,
