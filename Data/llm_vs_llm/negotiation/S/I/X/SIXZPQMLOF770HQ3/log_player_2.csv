"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given the information provided, here's my analysis:

1. The product is worth at most $10,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice's asking price is $12,000, which exceeds my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $10,000

Alice's current offer ($12,000) exceeds my maximum value, so I shouldn't accept it. I could make a counteroffer, but since John is already offering the product at my maximum value ($10,000), there's no advantage in continuing negotiations with Alice unless I believe I can get it for less than $10,000.
