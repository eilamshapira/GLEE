"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice is offering the product at $12,000, which is the same price as John's offer, and this is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, it makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer. There's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice, especially knowing that the product is worth $10,000 to her.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, I'll start with a reasonable offer that's above her cost but well below the maximum I'm willing to pay. This gives room for negotiation while still ensuring a potential profit for Alice.

{""product_price"": 10800}

This offer would give Alice an $800 profit while saving me $1,200 compared to buying from either Alice or John at $12,000. It's a fair starting point that shows I'm serious about making a deal while leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has lowered her price from $12,000 to $11,400, which is a good movement in the negotiation. This price would save me $600 compared to John's offer. While we might be able to negotiate further down, there's also a risk of Alice becoming frustrated and returning to a higher price. The current offer is reasonable as it provides savings for me while giving Alice a good profit margin.
