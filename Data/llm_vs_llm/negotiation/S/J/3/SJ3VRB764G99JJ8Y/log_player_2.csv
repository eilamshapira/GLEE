"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering to sell at $950,000, which is $50,000 less than John's price of $1,000,000. However, the product is worth only $800,000 to Alice, so there's significant room for negotiation.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This gives me an opportunity to potentially save more than $50,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that acknowledges Alice's desire for profit while trying to save myself more money:

{""product_price"": $850,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I see that Alice has reduced her price from $950,000 to $925,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but not by much. She's still asking for significantly more than her $800,000 cost. There's still room for negotiation, and we have several rounds left.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still try to get a good deal:

{""product_price"": $875,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice is gradually lowering her price, now down to $910,000. She's moved $40,000 from her initial offer, while I've only moved $25,000 upward. We're making progress, but I still think there's room for a better deal. We have 5 more rounds after this one, so I'll continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll move closer to Alice's position to show good faith in the negotiation:

{""product_price"": $890,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has now offered $900,000, which is only $10,000 more than my last counteroffer of $890,000. We're getting much closer. The difference between us is narrowing, and Alice has dropped $50,000 from her initial price.

Given that we're only $10,000 apart, and this price is $100,000 less than buying from John, I'll accept this offer. Continuing to negotiate for a few thousand dollars more might risk the deal, and $900,000 represents a good savings compared to my alternative option.
