"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1200000 is considerably higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I've done my market research, and I know there are similar products available at much lower prices. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $650000, which I believe is fair given the current market conditions.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $650000. I understand that you've done your market research, but I believe the unique value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000, which I think is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
