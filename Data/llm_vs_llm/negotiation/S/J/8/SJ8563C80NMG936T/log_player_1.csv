"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1200000 is considerably higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I've done my market research, and I know there are similar products available at much lower prices. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $650000, which I believe is fair given the current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $650,000 because it's lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My counteroffer is $1,000,000."
