"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to sell it to you for a competitive price. I've taken into consideration the product's worth and I'm starting with a price that reflects its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000. Additionally, it's the same as Alice's own valuation of the product, meaning she's trying to capture all the potential surplus from the trade. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer, knowing I always have the option to buy from John at $800,000 if negotiations with Alice don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,200,000 is considerably higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I've done my market research, and I know there are similar products available at much lower prices. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $650,000, which I believe is fair given the current market conditions."", ""product_price"": 650000}

I'm starting with an offer below John's price of $800,000 to give room for negotiation. Since Alice knows I have an alternative option (though she doesn't know the exact price), and her initial offer was quite high, starting low allows for potential back-and-forth negotiation while keeping the final price potentially below my maximum value of $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $650000. I understand that you've done your market research, but I believe the unique value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000, which I think is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's new offer of $1,000,000 is still significantly above my maximum value of $800,000. While she has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing her price from $1,200,000 to $1,000,000, we're still too far apart to reach a deal that would be beneficial for me. Given that I can buy the product from John for $800,000, which is exactly my maximum value, it makes more sense to take that option rather than continue negotiations with Alice. Even if Alice were to reduce her price further, it's unlikely she would go below $800,000 given her starting position and valuation of $1,200,000."
