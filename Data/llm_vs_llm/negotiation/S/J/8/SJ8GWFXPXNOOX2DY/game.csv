"Hello Bob, I'm reaching out regarding a product that I think would be of great value to you.

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1800000 is significantly higher than my current budget for this type of product. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it, considering its potential value. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand budget considerations are important, but I need to emphasize that $1200000 is the absolute minimum value of this product to me. I have another buyer, John, who is already willing to pay this amount. Given the product's exceptional quality and potential return on investment, I'm willing to reduce my initial price to $1550000. This represents a significant discount from my original offer while still reflecting the true market value of what you're getting. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges your budget constraints while respecting the product's worth.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1550000 is still a bit too high for me. Given my budget constraints and the fact that I can secure the same product from John for $1000000, I'm prepared to offer $1350000 for this product. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential return on investment. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
