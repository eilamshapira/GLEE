Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand budget considerations are important, but I need to emphasize that $1200000 is the absolute minimum value of this product to me. I have another buyer, John, who is already willing to pay this amount. Given the product's exceptional quality and potential return on investment, I'm willing to reduce my initial price to $1550000. This represents a significant discount from my original offer while still reflecting the true market value of what you're getting. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges your budget constraints while respecting the product's worth.
