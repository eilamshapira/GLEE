"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While $1150000 is better than my alternative option, I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial price. Given market conditions and considering that I have another option at $1200000, I'd like to counter with $1050000. This still gives you a good profit margin while allowing me to save on my purchase. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
