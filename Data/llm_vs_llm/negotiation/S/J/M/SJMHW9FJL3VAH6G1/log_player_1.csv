Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, Bob, let's talk about this fantastic product. I'm willing to part with it for **$1,150,000**. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it offers you.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While $1150000 is better than my alternative option, I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial price. Given market conditions and considering that I have another option at $1200000, I'd like to counter with $1050000. This still gives you a good profit margin while allowing me to save on my purchase. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","This is a tough one! Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is tempting, but I know the product is worth more. However, I don't want to drag this out too long and risk losing the deal.

I'm going to **RejectOffer** and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, given the value of the product, I can't go as low as $1,050,000.

I'm willing to lower my price to **$1,125,000**. This still gives you a significant discount compared to your other option, and it ensures I'm making a fair profit.

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}"
