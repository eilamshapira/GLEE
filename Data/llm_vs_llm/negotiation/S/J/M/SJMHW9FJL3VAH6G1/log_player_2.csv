"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm ready to sell you this amazing product. How does $1150000 sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll analyze this situation:

- Alice is offering the product for $1,150,000
- The product is worth at most $1,200,000 to me
- John is willing to sell it for $1,200,000
- Alice's cost is $1,000,000

Alice's offer is already $50,000 less than what I would pay to John, so it's a better deal than my alternative. However, since Alice's cost is $1,000,000, there might be room to negotiate an even better price.

I should reject Alice's first offer and make a counteroffer to see if I can get an even better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While $1,150,000 is better than my alternative option, I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial price. Given market conditions and considering that I have another option at $1,200,000, I'd like to counter with $1,050,000. This still gives you a good profit margin while allowing me to save on my purchase. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. How about we meet in the middle at $1125000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll analyze Alice's new offer:

- Alice has come down to $1,125,000 from her initial $1,150,000
- This is still $75,000 less than John's price of $1,200,000
- There might still be room to negotiate further, as Alice's cost is $1,000,000

Alice has moved toward my position, showing willingness to negotiate. I could try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet even closer to the middle, but her current offer is already a good savings compared to my alternative.

Given that she's already reduced her price and this represents a $75,000 savings from my alternative option, I'll accept this offer.
