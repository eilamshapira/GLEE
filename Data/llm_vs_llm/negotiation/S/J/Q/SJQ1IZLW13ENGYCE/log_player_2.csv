"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,500,000 exceeds the maximum amount the product is worth to me ($1,000,000), and John is willing to sell the same product for $1,000,000, I should not accept Alice's current offer.

I have two remaining options: make a counteroffer to Alice or buy from John immediately. Since John's price represents the maximum I'm willing to pay anyway, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice when a guaranteed option at my maximum price is available.
