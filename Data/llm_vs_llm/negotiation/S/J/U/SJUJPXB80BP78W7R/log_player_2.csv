You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $11,000 is close to my maximum budget of $12,000, but I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll choose to reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try and negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's initial offer was $11,000 and I want to save as much money as possible, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower, but still reasonable, to give room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly above that value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $10,500 is lower than her initial offer, which is a good sign. However, I still want to try and negotiate a better price since I know the product is worth $8,000 to her.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer. Since my previous counteroffer of $8,500 was rejected, I'll increase it slightly to show that I'm willing to compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

(I'll wait for the next round to send my new counteroffer)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's latest offer was $10,500 and my previous counteroffer of $8,500 was rejected, I'll make a new counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one, but still lower than Alice's latest offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $10,200 is getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since she's willing to lower the price, it suggests that she's motivated to sell.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer. Given that my previous counteroffer of $9,000 was rejected, I'll increase it slightly to $9,500, which is still lower than Alice's latest offer but shows that I'm willing to meet her halfway.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","As previously decided, my new counteroffer will be slightly higher than my previous one, but still lower than Alice's latest offer of $10,200.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $10,100 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $9,500, and it's clear that she's trying to meet me halfway. Considering that I've already invested time in negotiating and I'm getting close to a good price, I'll think carefully about my next move.

Given that Alice's offer is still slightly above my desired price, but I'm running out of rounds to negotiate (only 3 rounds left), I'll consider accepting her offer. However, I'll make one more attempt to see if I can get an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's latest offer of $10,100 and my previous counteroffer of $9,500, I'll make a new counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one, but still lower than Alice's latest offer.

Since I'm running out of rounds to negotiate, I'll make a more aggressive counteroffer to try and get the best possible price. I'll offer $9,800, which is closer to my previous counteroffer, but still shows that I'm willing to compromise.

{""product_price"": 9800}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $10,050 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $9,800, and it's clear that she's trying to meet me halfway. Considering that I've already invested time in negotiating and I'm getting close to a good price, I'll think carefully about my next move.

Given that Alice's offer is still slightly above my desired price, but I'm running out of rounds to negotiate (only 1 round left), I'll consider accepting her offer. If I reject it and make another counteroffer, there's a risk that Alice might not accept it, and I'll have to buy from John for $12,000.

I'll weigh my options carefully. Accepting Alice's offer of $10,050 would save me $1,950 compared to buying from John, which is a significant amount. On the other hand, I might be able to get an even better deal if I make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

(I'll wait for the next round to send my new counteroffer, but I'm prepared to accept a reasonable offer from Alice)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","This is the final round, and I need to make a decision that will conclude the negotiation. Considering Alice's latest offer of $10,050 and my previous counteroffer of $9,800, I'll make a new counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one, but still lower than Alice's latest offer.

I'll offer $10,000, which is a compromise between my previous counteroffer and Alice's latest offer. This price is still lower than Alice's latest offer, but it's closer to her price, showing that I'm willing to meet her halfway.
