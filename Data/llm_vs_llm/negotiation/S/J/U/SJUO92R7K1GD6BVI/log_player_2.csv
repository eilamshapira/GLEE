"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product at a price of $1400000. It's a great deal considering its value and what it can do for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $1,400,000
3. John's fixed price is $1,500,000
4. The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice

Alice's current offer ($1,400,000) is still high, and there's room for negotiation since I know her cost is $1,200,000. While it's better than John's price ($1,500,000), I should try to negotiate for a better deal. Since there's no immediate pressure to accept and I have John's offer as a backup, I can afford to negotiate with Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but gives room for negotiation:

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,400,000 is quite high considering market conditions. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000, which I believe is a fair price that would work well for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

This counteroffer is strategically chosen because:
1. It's slightly above Alice's cost ($1,200,000), so she can still make a profit
2. It's significantly below both her offer ($1,400,000) and John's price ($1,500,000)
3. It leaves room for further negotiation if needed
4. The polite but firm message acknowledges her offer while asserting my position"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but considering the value of the product, I'm willing to lower my initial offer slightly. How about we settle at $1350000? I believe this is a fair middle ground for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze the new situation:

1. Alice has reduced her price from $1,400,000 to $1,350,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. The new price is still $150,000 less than John's price
3. There's still a significant gap between her cost ($1,200,000) and her current offer
4. She came down $50,000, but I might be able to get a better price

Since she's showing flexibility and there's still room for negotiation, I should continue negotiating. The gap between her cost and current offer suggests we can find a better middle ground.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price. While $1,350,000 is better, I believe we can find a price that's more beneficial for both of us. I can offer $1,290,000, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer and would provide you with a good profit margin."", ""product_price"": 1290000}

This counteroffer is strategic because:
1. It shows movement from my previous offer ($1,250,000 to $1,290,000), demonstrating my willingness to compromise
2. It still provides Alice with a $90,000 profit margin above her cost
3. It's significantly better than John's price ($1,500,000)
4. The message acknowledges her concession while maintaining a professional and cooperative tone
5. It leaves room for one more round of negotiation if needed, while still being a serious offer"
