"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $100 might be a bit steep, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal that works for both of us. How about we split the difference?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your new offer. How about we try $77.50?",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I still need to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me at a price that works for both of us. How about we try $90?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need you to consider my budget constraints. How about we try $80? It's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the market value.",80.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your seriousness about the offer, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need you to meet me at a price that's closer to my target. How about we try $92.50? It's a compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",92.5,Alice,7,
