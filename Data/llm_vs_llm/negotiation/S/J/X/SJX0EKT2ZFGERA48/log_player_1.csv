"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my target price of at least $100. Bob's offer of $60 is too low, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $100 might be a bit steep, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal that works for both of us. How about we split the difference?"", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your new offer. How about we try $77.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $77.50 is still below my target price, and I believe I can get a better deal. Since I have the option to sell to John for $100, I'll continue to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach a price closer to my goal. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I still need to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me at a price that works for both of us. How about we try $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need you to consider my budget constraints. How about we try $80? It's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $80 is still below my target price, and I know that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $100. Since Bob has stated that $80 is the highest he's willing to go, I don't think I can get a better deal from him. However, I'll try to negotiate one more time to see if he's willing to budge, before considering selling to John. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your seriousness about the offer, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need you to meet me at a price that's closer to my target. How about we try $92.50? It's a compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 92.50}"
