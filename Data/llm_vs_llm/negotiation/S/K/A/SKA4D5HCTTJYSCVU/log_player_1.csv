"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its market value and unique features, I'm offering it at $1,500,000. This is a competitive price for an asset of this caliber."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe the product's value to me is around $1000000. Considering my budget constraints, I'd like to counteroffer at this price. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. $1,000,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, as it's even lower than John's guaranteed offer. Since Bob knows the product is worth $1,200,000 to him, there should be room for a deal that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must decline. I have another buyer willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the actual market value of the product. However, I'd prefer to work with you. I can offer the product for $1,350,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. This represents good value given the product's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1100000, which is still a fair price considering the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John. Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still below John's guaranteed price of $1,200,000, and Bob seems unwilling to meet or exceed this amount. Since we've gone through several rounds of negotiation without reaching a price above $1,200,000, it makes more sense to take John's sure offer rather than risk further negotiations that might not improve."
