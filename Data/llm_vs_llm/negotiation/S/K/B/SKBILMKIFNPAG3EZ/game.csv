"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price of $2300000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000, considering the product's value and my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $1000000 is significantly below the product's market value and my minimum acceptable price. I understand my initial offer might have been high, so I'm willing to adjust it. Given the product's quality and value, I can offer it to you for $1900000, which is a substantial reduction from my initial price. Would you consider this more reasonable offer?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate the reduction in price. However, $1900000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your revised price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1450000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value and my limitations.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
