Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price of $2300000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000, considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. His offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and I know I can get a better price either from him or from John."

While I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly below the product's market value and my minimum acceptable price.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate the reduction in price. However, $1900000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your revised price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1450000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value and my limitations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is below John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000, and Bob's negotiation pattern suggests he's unlikely to go much higher, I'll take the sure deal with John to maximize my profit."
