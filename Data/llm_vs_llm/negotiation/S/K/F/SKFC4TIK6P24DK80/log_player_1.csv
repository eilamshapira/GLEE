Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I believe the product is valuable, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000, considering the benefits and returns I expect from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your counteroffer. However, I need to point out that $1,000,000 is my absolute minimum threshold for this product - it's what I could get from other interested parties without further negotiation. Given that this product will provide you with $1,500,000 in value, I'm offering you a significant opportunity to capture substantial surplus. Let me meet you partway - I can offer it for $1,200,000, which would give you $300,000 in net value while allowing me a reasonable return. This seems like a fair split of the additional value this product will create for you. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for meeting me partway, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe that $1200000 is a bit steep for me. Considering the product's value to me is $1500000 and I can get it from John for that price, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1050000. This price takes into account the value I expect to receive from the product while also giving you a reasonable return.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I think there's a misunderstanding in your last message. John is not selling the product to you - John is an alternative buyer who would purchase from me at $1,000,000. You're the only one who can realize the $1,500,000 value from this product. I appreciate your increased offer to $1,050,000, which shows we're making progress. Let's continue finding middle ground - I can come down to $1,150,000, which would still give you $350,000 in surplus value.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for clarifying the situation with John, Alice. I understand that I'm the one who can realize the $1500000 value from this product. I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1150000. However, I'm still trying to get the best deal possible. Considering your minimum threshold is $1000000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1075000. This price is closer to your threshold while still giving me a significant surplus value.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your increased offer of $1,075,000. We're getting closer, but I need to emphasize that the surplus value in this deal heavily favors you at that price point - you'd be getting $425,000 in value while I'd only be getting $75,000 above my minimum. For a fair negotiation, I think we should split the surplus more equitably. My final offer is $1,125,000, which would give you $375,000 in surplus value and me $125,000 above my minimum. This is a 75/25 split in your favor, which I believe is quite reasonable given the significant value you'll receive from this product. I hope we can close this deal at this price point."", ""product_price"": 1125000}"
