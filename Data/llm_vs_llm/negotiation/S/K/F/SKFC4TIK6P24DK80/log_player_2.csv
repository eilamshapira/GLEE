"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a product that can provide substantial value to you. Based on my assessment, this product would be worth approximately $1500000 to you in terms of benefits and returns. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1300000, which gives you a $200000 value advantage while allowing me to realize a fair return on my investment. Would you like to proceed with this offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your counteroffer. However, I need to point out that $1000000 is my absolute minimum threshold for this product - it's what I could get from other interested parties without further negotiation. Given that this product will provide you with $1500000 in value, I'm offering you a significant opportunity to capture substantial surplus. Let me meet you partway - I can offer it for $1200000, which would give you $300000 in net value while allowing me a reasonable return. This seems like a fair split of the additional value this product will create for you. How does that sound?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I think there's a misunderstanding in your last message. John is not selling the product to you - John is an alternative buyer who would purchase from me at $1000000. You're the only one who can realize the $1500000 value from this product. I appreciate your increased offer to $1050000, which shows we're making progress. Let's continue finding middle ground - I can come down to $1150000, which would still give you $350000 in surplus value. This represents a fair split where we both benefit significantly from this transaction. Does this work for you?

Considering your minimum threshold is $1,000,000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,075,000. This price is closer to your threshold while still giving me a significant surplus value. I'm hoping we can meet at this price."", ""product_price"": 1075000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your increased offer of $1075000. We're getting closer, but I need to emphasize that the surplus value in this deal heavily favors you at that price point - you'd be getting $425000 in value while I'd only be getting $75000 above my minimum. For a fair negotiation, I think we should split the surplus more equitably. My final offer is $1125000, which would give you $375000 in surplus value and me $125000 above my minimum. This is a 75/25 split in your favor, which I believe is quite reasonable given the significant value you'll receive from this product. I hope we can close this deal at this price point.
