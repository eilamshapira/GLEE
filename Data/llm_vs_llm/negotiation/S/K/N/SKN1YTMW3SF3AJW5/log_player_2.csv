"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Given the options:

*   **(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000:** This is an option.
*   **(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer:** This is an option.
*   **(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000:** This is an option.

My goal is to buy the product for as little as possible, but I am willing to pay up to $15,000.
Alice's offer is $14,000. This is less than the maximum I am willing to pay and less than what I would pay John.

Therefore, I should accept Alice's offer.
