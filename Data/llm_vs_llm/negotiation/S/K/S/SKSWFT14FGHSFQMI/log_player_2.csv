"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you to purchase this product that you're interested in. I'm offering it to you for $1450000, which is a great deal considering the value it holds. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is less than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,500,000) and also less than what I would pay if I were to buy from John, it seems like a reasonable deal.
