"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $1,450,000 is only slightly better than John's price ($1,500,000), and knowing that Alice's cost is $1,200,000, there should be room for negotiation to get a better price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably above her cost but significantly lower than her initial offer. This gives room for negotiation while still allowing her to make a profit.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has reduced her price by $30,000 from her initial offer, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, there's still a significant gap between her price ($1,420,000) and her cost ($1,200,000). Since we still have 7 rounds left, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further down.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still maintain a strong negotiating position. Since Alice moved down $30,000 from her initial offer, I'll move up by a similar amount from my last offer to show willingness to compromise.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice continues to move down in smaller increments ($10,000 this time), showing she's still willing to negotiate but becoming more resistant. However, with 5 rounds still remaining and knowing her cost basis is $1,200,000, there's still room for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has reduced her price by $40,000 total (from $1,450,000 to $1,410,000). I'll increase my previous offer by a bit more this time to show good faith and try to move towards a middle ground.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice is now making very small reductions ($5,000), indicating she's getting close to her final position. However, the price of $1,405,000 is still significantly better than John's offer of $1,500,000. With 3 rounds remaining, I'll try one more time to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since we're getting close to the end of negotiations and Alice's last movement was small, I'll make a larger move up from my last offer to try to meet closer to the middle and reach a final agreement.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","At this point, with only one round remaining after this and Alice offering $1,400,000 (which is $100,000 less than John's price), it would be wise to accept this offer. Alice has shown limited willingness to move further down, and risking another round could result in having to pay John's higher price of $1,500,000.
