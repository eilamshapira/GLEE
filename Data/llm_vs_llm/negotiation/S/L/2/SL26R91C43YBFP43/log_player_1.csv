Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a special price of $190. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm happy to answer any questions you might have."", ""product_price"": 190}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a price significantly higher than our minimum acceptable price ($120). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows us to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""special price"" and ""significant value,"" we aim to create a perception of value exceeding the asking price. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""happy to answer any questions you might have"" signals flexibility and willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel more comfortable engaging.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing potential profit while acknowledging the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
