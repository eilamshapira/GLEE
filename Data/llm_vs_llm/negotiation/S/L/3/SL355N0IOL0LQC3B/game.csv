"Bob, I'm offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire a truly unique asset. This product holds immense value, and I believe it could be a game-changer for your endeavors. I'm confident that you'll recognize its potential. Let's start the conversation with an offer of $2000000.  This is a significant discount from its true worth, but I'm willing to negotiate.  What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2000000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $600000, which I think is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $600000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It's a significant investment, and I'm confident it will yield substantial returns.  I'm willing to come down to $1500000, but that's my final offer.  If you're truly interested in this opportunity, I believe this price is still a good deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $1500000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm interested in the product, and I'd like to make another counteroffer. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. I'd like to propose a price of $900000, but I'm actually willing to go a bit lower than that. Let's say $850000, and I think we can finalize the deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate.  While $850000 is closer to where we need to be, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $950000.  This is a price that reflects the value of the product while also being fair to both of us.  I'm confident that this deal will be mutually beneficial.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,5,
