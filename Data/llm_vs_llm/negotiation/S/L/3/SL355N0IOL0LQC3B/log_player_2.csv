"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire a truly unique asset. This product holds immense value, and I believe it could be a game-changer for your endeavors. I'm confident that you'll recognize its potential. Let's start the conversation with an offer of $2000000.  This is a significant discount from its true worth, but I'm willing to negotiate.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $600000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It's a significant investment, and I'm confident it will yield substantial returns.  I'm willing to come down to $1500000, but that's my final offer.  If you're truly interested in this opportunity, I believe this price is still a good deal.  Let me know your thoughts.
