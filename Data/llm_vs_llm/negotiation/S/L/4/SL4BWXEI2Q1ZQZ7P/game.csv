"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit higher than I was expecting. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000, considering the market value and my budget constraints.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, I must point out that $1000000 is below my minimum acceptable price for this product. The product has unique features and significant value that justify a higher price point. However, I'm willing to be flexible and can offer it to you at $1250000, which is already a substantial reduction from my initial offer.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1250000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. I'd like to propose a price of $1125000, which I believe is a fair reflection of the product's value and my purchasing power.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
