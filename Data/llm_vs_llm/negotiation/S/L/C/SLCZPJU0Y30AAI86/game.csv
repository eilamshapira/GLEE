"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm very interested in the product, I find $11500 to be quite high. Given market conditions and comparable products, I believe a more reasonable price would be $9000. This would still provide you with a good profit margin while being more aligned with the product's value. I look forward to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to lower the price to $10500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and my costs. I hope we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price. Your movement shows we're making progress toward an agreement. However, $10500 is still higher than what I was hoping to pay. I can offer $9500, which would provide you with a healthy profit margin while being more reasonable for me. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in reaching a deal. Would you consider this fair middle ground?",9500.0,Bob,4,
