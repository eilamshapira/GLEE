Send your offer to Bob.,"After considering the situation, I need to make a strategic decision for my offer to Bob.

Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay exactly that amount, I don't need to sell to Bob for any less.

Bob values the product at $800,000, which is less than what John is willing to pay. If I offer Bob any price above $800,000, he would rationally reject it since it would exceed his valuation. And if I offer $800,000 or less, I would be losing money compared to selling to John.

The optimal choice is clear:

{""product_price"": $1,000,000}

This offer allows Bob to decide, but if he rejects (which is likely since it exceeds his valuation), I can proceed with my guaranteed sale to John without losing any value."
