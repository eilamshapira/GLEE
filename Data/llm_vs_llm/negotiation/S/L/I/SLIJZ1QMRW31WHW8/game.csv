Hello Bob! I have a wonderful product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it for $300. What do you think?,300.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product looks interesting, $300 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to offer $50.",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand you're working with a budget, but $50 is much too low for this product's value. I can come down from my initial offer, but I couldn't go below $250. This is a high-quality product worth every penny. Would you consider this price?",250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $250 is still significantly above my budget.  I could go up to $75.  This is a fair offer considering my price limit.",75.0,Bob,4,
