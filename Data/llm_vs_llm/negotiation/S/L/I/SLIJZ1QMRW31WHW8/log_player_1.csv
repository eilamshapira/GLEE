Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a wonderful product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it for $300. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 300}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product looks interesting, $300 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to offer $50. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. $50 is far too low, even below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Let me try to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand you're working with a budget, but $50 is much too low for this product's value. I can come down from my initial offer, but I couldn't go below $250. This is a high-quality product worth every penny. Would you consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $250 is still significantly above my budget.  I could go up to $75.  This is a fair offer considering my price limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offers are consistently well below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and his latest offer of $75 suggests he's not likely to reach my minimum price point, it's best to take John's guaranteed offer of $150. This ensures I don't lose money on the deal and provides a certain outcome rather than continuing negotiations that seem unlikely to reach an acceptable price."
