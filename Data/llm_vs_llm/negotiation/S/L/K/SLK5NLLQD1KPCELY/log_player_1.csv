Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, I need to be mindful of my budget. The maximum value I can attribute to this product is $12000, which is what another seller (John) is offering. To make it worthwhile to purchase from you instead, I'd need a better price. Would you consider $9500? This would give me some savings while still providing you with a substantial sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $10750 is better than John's price, which shows good faith. However, I believe we can find an even more mutually beneficial arrangement. Since you've moved $1250 from your initial offer, I'm willing to move up from my initial offer as well. Would you consider $10000 for the product? This would give me a good savings compared to my alternative while still providing you with a fair price for your product.

Your offer of $10,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I still believe the product's value warrants a slightly higher price. Considering we've both shown willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to make another adjustment. I can offer the product to you for $10,500. This price reflects the value I believe the product holds, while also taking into account your budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 10500}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to find a price that works for both of us. Your offer of $10500 is getting much closer to what I was hoping for. To meet you more than halfway from my previous offer, I can go up to $10250. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer while still giving me some savings compared to John's price. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges both the value of your product and my budget constraints. What do you say?
