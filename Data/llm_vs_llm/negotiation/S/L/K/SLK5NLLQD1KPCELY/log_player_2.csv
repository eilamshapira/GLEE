"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Based on the information provided, Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is exactly the same price that John is offering and also exactly equal to the maximum value of the product to me. Since there's no advantage to accepting Alice's current offer or buying from John (both cost the same), and there's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, I need to be mindful of my budget. The maximum value I can attribute to this product is $12,000, which is what another seller (John) is offering. To make it worthwhile to purchase from you instead, I'd need a better price. Would you consider $9,500? This would give me some savings while still providing you with a substantial sale."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your transparency regarding the other seller's price. However, I must consider the product's value to me, which is substantially higher than $8000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to find a mutually beneficial price. Given your proposed price of $9500, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I can offer the product to you for $10750. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has come down from her initial price of $12,000 to $10,750, which is $1,250 less than both her initial offer and John's price. This is a significant improvement and represents good savings. However, since we're only in round 3 of a possible 10 rounds, there may be room to negotiate further and maximize my savings.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $10,750 is better than John's price, which shows good faith. However, I believe we can find an even more mutually beneficial arrangement. Since you've moved $1,250 from your initial offer, I'm willing to move up from my initial offer as well. Would you consider $10,000 for the product? This would give me a good savings compared to my alternative while still providing you with a fair price for your product."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the effort you're putting into finding a mutually beneficial price. Your offer of $10000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I still believe the product's value warrants a slightly higher price. Considering we've both shown willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to make another adjustment. I can offer the product to you for $10500. This price reflects the value I believe the product holds, while also taking into account your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has now come down to $10,500, which is $1,500 less than John's price of $12,000. This is a good offer that represents significant savings. We're now in round 5 of 10, and Alice has moved from $12,000 to $10,750 to $10,500, showing smaller increments of movement. Since there's still room to negotiate and potentially save more money, I'll make one more counteroffer.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to find a price that works for both of us. Your offer of $10,500 is getting much closer to what I was hoping for. To meet you more than halfway from my previous offer, I can go up to $10,250. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer while still giving me some savings compared to John's price. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges both the value of your product and my budget constraints. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10250}"
