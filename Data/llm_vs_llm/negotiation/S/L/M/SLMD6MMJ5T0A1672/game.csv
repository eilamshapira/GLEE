"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I must say that $8000 is a bit lower than I had anticipated. Considering the product's exceptional quality and potential benefits, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to propose a price of $22000, which is still a competitive offer given the product's value. I'm open to further negotiations and look forward to hearing your thoughts.",22000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still above my budget.
