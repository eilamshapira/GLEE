Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value and rarity of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. Considering my budget and the product's potential benefits, I'd like to propose a price of $8000. I'm open to further negotiations and look forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my initial price and the value I know the product holds (at least $15,000), I choose to reject his offer. I will proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer, aiming to find a mutually agreeable price that is closer to the product's true value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I must say that $8,000 is a bit lower than I had anticipated. Considering the product's exceptional quality and potential benefits, I'm willing to make a compromise.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $22000 is still above my budget. Considering the product's value and our previous discussions, I'd like to propose a price of $9500. I believe this is a fair offer, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly lower than my expected price and the value I know the product holds (at least $15,000). Given that I have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000, I am not willing to sell the product for such a low price. I will proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer, trying to bring the price closer to the product's true value."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your persistence, but I must reiterate that $9,500 is still below the product's value. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'd like to propose a price of $20,000, which is a more reasonable offer given the product's quality and potential benefits. If we cannot reach a mutually agreeable price soon, I will have to consider other options. I look forward to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 20000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually agreeable price, but $20000 is still above my budget. Considering our previous discussions and the fact that I have other options available, I'd like to propose a price of $10500. I believe this is a reasonable offer, and I'm willing to make a deal if we can meet at this price.

Bob's offer of $10,500 is still lower than the value I know the product holds (at least $15,000) and John's guaranteed offer. While Bob is increasing his offer, it's not enough to meet my expectations. I will proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer, trying to bring the price closer to the product's true value. However, I'm also keeping in mind that I have a limited number of rounds left, and I may need to consider selling to John if Bob's offers don't improve significantly."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still above my budget. Considering our previous discussions and the fact that I have a competing offer from John for $12000, I'd like to propose a price of $11500. I believe this is a reasonable offer, and I'm willing to make a deal if we can meet at this price. If not, I'll have to consider John's offer more seriously. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500.
