Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'd like to start the negotiation at a price that reflects its true value."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I really like the product, but given my options, I'm aiming for a deal that works well for both of us. How about we settle at $9000? Looking forward to your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,000 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($8,000), but lower than my initial offer, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

My counteroffer will be $10,500, which is still lower than the initial offer I made but higher than Bob's counteroffer.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my new offer to Bob is: $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a deal that works well for both of us. I'm willing to be flexible, but I still believe the product is worth more than $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I think this price reflects the product's true value, and it's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but given my alternatives, I'm aiming for a bit more favorable price. Would you be willing to settle at $10000? I think that's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's new offer of $10,000 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $10,500, and it's still a good price, I'll consider accepting it. However, I'll think about the potential of getting an even better price if I continue negotiating.

Given that Bob's offer is already high and close to my target price, and considering the risk of losing the deal if I continue negotiating, I've decided to accept Bob's offer of $10,000.

My decision is:
