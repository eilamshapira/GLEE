# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have this premium product that I'd like to offer you. It's a high-quality item that I'm currently selling for $165. However, because I value potential long-term customers, I can offer it to you at the special price of $155. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have another buyer, John, interested in purchasing it. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155.
