"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1200000 is a bit steep for me. While I recognize the product's potential, my budget is capped at $800000. I'm willing to offer you $800000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
