"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay, and buying from John would cost the same, I might as well reject Alice's offer to see if she's willing to negotiate a lower price.
