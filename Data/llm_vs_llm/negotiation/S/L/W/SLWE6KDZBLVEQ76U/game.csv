"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $20000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and potential value.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $12000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let me know if this works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, I must point out that $12000 is too low considering the product's value. I can lower my initial price to $17000, which I believe is a more reasonable compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but $17000 is still a bit high for me. I can go up to $13000. This is the highest I can offer within my budget. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,4,
