Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $20,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and potential value."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $12000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let me make a counteroffer to Bob:
{""message"": ""Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, I must point out that $12,000 is too low considering the product's value. I can lower my initial price to $17,000, which I believe is a more reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, I must point out that $12,000 is too low considering the product's value.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but $17000 is still a bit high for me. I can go up to $13000. This is the highest I can offer within my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $13,000. This is a reasonable price that's $3,000 better than John's guaranteed offer, and given that we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, it's unlikely that Bob will increase his offer significantly. Better to secure this deal now rather than risk losing it by pushing too hard."
