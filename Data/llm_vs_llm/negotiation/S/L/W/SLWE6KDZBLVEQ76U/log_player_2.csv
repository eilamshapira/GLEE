Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, I must point out that $12000 is too low considering the product's value. I can lower my initial price to $17000, which I believe is a more reasonable compromise.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
