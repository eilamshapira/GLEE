"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be really interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Looking at this offer rationally:

1. Alice is offering the product for $250
2. John is willing to sell the same product for $120
3. The product is worth no more than $120 to me

Since the product is only worth up to $120 to me, and John is offering it at exactly $120, Alice's price of $250 is significantly higher than both the value I place on it and my alternative option.
