"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $950,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth and I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must point out that I'm able to purchase this same product from another seller for $800000. While I'd prefer to do business with you, I can't justify paying $150000 more. I'm willing to offer $700000 for the product, which would give you a quick sale while saving me a bit compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, as his offer of $700,000 is below the product's value to both of us. I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial price. Selling to John is an option, but I'll try to get a better deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your transparency about having an alternative option. However, I must point out that selling to you directly would save us both the hassle of dealing with other parties. Considering this, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer the product to you for $920,000, which is still a premium but takes into account your alternative option and the benefits of a direct sale."", ""product_price"": 920000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the convenience of a direct sale, but I need to be practical about the numbers. Your offer of $920000 is still $120000 more than what John is charging ($800000). The product is worth no more than $800000 to me, so paying above that wouldn't make financial sense. To make this work between us, I can offer $750000, which gives you a quick sale and still saves me money compared to going with John. This is a $50000 benefit for you over what the product is worth to you, according to my understanding. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make another counteroffer to Bob in the next round. While Bob's offer of $750,000 is closer to the product's value, it's still below what I'm willing to accept, especially considering Bob mentioned the product is worth $800,000 to him. I'll try to find a middle ground that benefits both of us. Selling to John is still an option, but I'll try to negotiate a better deal with Bob first."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering the product's value to both of us, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer the product to you for $870,000, which is closer to the middle ground between our initial offers. This price still reflects the convenience and benefits of a direct sale, while also taking into account your budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 870000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price point. However, I need to be completely transparent - I cannot and will not pay more than $800000 for this product, as that's both its maximum value to me and the price John is offering. I'm still interested in doing business with you directly, so I'm willing to offer $780000, which gives you a quick sale and provides you with a solid profit based on the product's worth to you. This is my best offer that makes financial sense for me while still being advantageous for you compared to the product's value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make another counteroffer to Bob in the next round. While Bob's offer of $780,000 is close to the product's value, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Since Bob has explicitly stated that he cannot pay more than $800,000, I'll try to get as close to that price as possible. Selling to John is still an option, but I'll try to get a better offer from Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your transparency about your budget constraints. I understand that you're willing to pay up to $800,000 for the product. Considering this, I'm willing to make a final compromise. I can offer the product to you for $795,000, which is very close to your maximum budget. This price reflects the benefits of a direct sale and the value of the product to both of us. I believe this is a fair price that works for both parties."", ""product_price"": 795000}"
