"Alice, while I appreciate the unique value of the product, your initial offer is beyond my budget. I'm willing to consider purchasing it for $600000. Let me know if this works for you or if you have another figure in mind.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $600000 is simply too low for this product. It's worth significantly more. How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $1200000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still outside of my budget. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $700000. This is a significant step up from my last offer and reflects my interest in the product. Please let me know if this could work for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but $700000 is still not enough. I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750000. This is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this could work for you.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is still too low. To be honest, I'm starting to think we might not be able to reach an agreement. I'm willing to compromise one last time and offer the product for $850000.  This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll need to explore other options.",850000.0,Alice,7,
