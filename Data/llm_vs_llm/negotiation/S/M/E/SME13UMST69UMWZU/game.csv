"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm happy to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I cannot go as low as $100. The product's quality and my costs make it impossible for me to sell below $130. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. Would you consider this price?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110.  Let's split the difference and make a deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
