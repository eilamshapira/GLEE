"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. I'm willing to sell it for $15000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me think about this:
1. Alice's offer is $15,000
2. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
3. John is willing to sell it for $12,000
4. Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price

Alice's offer of $15,000 is too high - it's $3,000 more than what the product is worth to me, and $3,000 more than John's price. There's no reason to accept this offer. Since we have 10 rounds of negotiation available, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a better deal with Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but leaves room for negotiation:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is quite high for this product. I know the market value well, and I can actually get it from another seller for $12,000. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. Would you consider $10,500 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in working together. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell the product for $12500. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has lowered her price from $15,000 to $12,500
2. This is still $500 more than John's price of $12,000
3. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
4. I have the guaranteed option to buy from John at $12,000

Since Alice's offer is still above both my maximum value and John's price, there's no reason to accept this offer. However, Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by significantly reducing her price. While I could continue negotiating, since Alice's current offer is above John's price and my maximum value, the most logical decision is to buy from John.
