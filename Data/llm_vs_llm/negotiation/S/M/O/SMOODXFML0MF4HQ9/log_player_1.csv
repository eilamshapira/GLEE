Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my target price. $100 is too low for me, and I think I can get a better deal from Bob or sell it to John for $150 if needed."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I can try to meet you halfway.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'll make another counteroffer. $110 is still too low, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob or sell it to John for $150. I'll try to meet Bob halfway again, but I won't go as low as $110. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer of $140."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:

$115 is still too low, and I'm not willing to sell the product at a loss. I'll make another counteroffer, trying to find a middle ground. Since Bob is willing to increase his offer, I'll decrease mine, but not too much. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer of $138."

Round 7

Round 8
Bob's offer:

$118 is still too low, and I'm starting to think that Bob might not be willing to meet me at a reasonable price. However, I'll give it one more try. Since we're running out of rounds, I'll make a more significant concession, hoping to close the deal. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer of $130, which is a more substantial decrease, but still above my minimum acceptable price."

Round 10
Bob's offer:
