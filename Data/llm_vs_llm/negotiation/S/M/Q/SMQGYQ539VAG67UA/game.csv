"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1300000 is fair. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I must say that $1300000 is significantly higher than what I'm prepared to pay. The product is worth no more than $800000 to me based on my valuation and market research. In fact, I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $800000. However, I'd like to do business with you if possible. I'm willing to offer $650000 for the product, which would allow you to make a sale quickly without me having to go to the other seller.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. However, my original price is based on the true value and potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This offer reflects my commitment to getting this deal done while ensuring a fair outcome for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for lowering your price, Alice, but $1100000 is still significantly above what makes financial sense for me. As I mentioned, the product is worth no more than $800000 to me, and I have a confirmed offer from John at exactly $800000. I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need a price that's competitive. I can offer you $720000, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a reasonable deal considering the product is worth $1000000 to you. This would create a win-win situation where we both benefit from the transaction.",720000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but I need to be straightforward with you. The value of this product is substantial, and while I'm willing to negotiate, I can't justify accepting anything less than $950000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. If this doesn't work for you, I understand, and I'll need to explore other options.",950000.0,Alice,5,
