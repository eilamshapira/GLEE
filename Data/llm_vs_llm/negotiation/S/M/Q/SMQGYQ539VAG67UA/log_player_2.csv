"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1300000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given that the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and John is offering it for exactly $800,000, Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is far too high. The difference is $500,000 above my maximum valuation, which makes this offer completely unreasonable for me.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I must say that $1,300,000 is significantly higher than what I'm prepared to pay. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me based on my valuation and market research. In fact, I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $800,000. However, I'd like to do business with you if possible. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product, which would allow you to make a sale quickly without me having to go to the other seller."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. However, my original price is based on the true value and potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This offer reflects my commitment to getting this deal done while ensuring a fair outcome for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's revised offer of $1,100,000 is still $300,000 above my maximum valuation of $800,000, and John is offering the exact same product at $800,000. Since I know the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, accepting Alice's offer would be a poor financial decision.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for lowering your price, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still significantly above what makes financial sense for me. As I mentioned, the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and I have a confirmed offer from John at exactly $800,000. I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need a price that's competitive. I can offer you $720,000, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a reasonable deal considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. This would create a win-win situation where we both benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 720000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but I need to be straightforward with you. The value of this product is substantial, and while I'm willing to negotiate, I can't justify accepting anything less than $950000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. If this doesn't work for you, I understand, and I'll need to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's ""final offer"" of $950,000 is still $150,000 above what I could pay John for the exact same product. Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed alternative at $800,000, it makes no financial sense to accept Alice's offer.
