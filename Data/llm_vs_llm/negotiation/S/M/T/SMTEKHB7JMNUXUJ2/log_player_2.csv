"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay, and I have the option to buy the product from John for the same price, I don't see any benefit in accepting Alice's offer without trying to negotiate a better price. On the other hand, buying from John immediately also doesn't give me any advantage since the price is the same. Therefore, the best course of action is to try and negotiate a better price with Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. This will give us room to negotiate and potentially find a mutually acceptable price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $10,000 is a significant reduction from her initial offer of $12,000, indicating that she is willing to negotiate. However, it's still $2,000 more than my initial counteroffer of $8,000. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice has already reduced the price from $12,000 to $10,000, I'll make a counteroffer that splits the difference between my previous offer of $8,000 and Alice's current offer of $10,000. This approach shows that I'm willing to compromise and move towards a mutually acceptable price.
