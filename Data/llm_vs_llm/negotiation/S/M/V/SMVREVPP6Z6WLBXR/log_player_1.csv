Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm glad you're interested in the product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to sell at $9800, that's only slightly below the $10000 I could pay elsewhere. Since this product is worth significantly less to you, I think we can find a price that benefits us both more substantially. I'm willing to offer $8500 for the product, which gives you a $500 profit and saves me $1500 compared to my alternative. This creates much more value for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to create a mutually beneficial deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of meeting in the middle between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200, which is a significant reduction from my initial price and still gives you a substantial discount compared to your alternative. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 9200}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate you moving in the right direction. However, I still think we can find a price that's more beneficial for both of us. Given that the product is worth $8000 to you, I'm offering $8800, which gives you an $800 profit while saving me $1200 compared to John's price. This is a fair middle ground that creates substantial value for both of us. What do you say?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I can see that we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial deal. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with the price you've proposed. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $9,000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with at this point. This still gives you a significant discount compared to your alternative, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
