"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm glad you're interested in the product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'm starting with a price of $9800, which I think is a fair value considering its worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering the product for $9,800, which is only $200 less than John's fixed price of $10,000. Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's significant room for negotiation.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to sell at $9,800, that's only slightly below the $10,000 I could pay elsewhere. Since this product is worth significantly less to you, I think we can find a price that benefits us both more substantially. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product, which gives you a $500 profit and saves me $1,500 compared to my alternative. This creates much more value for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to create a mutually beneficial deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of meeting in the middle between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9200, which is a significant reduction from my initial price and still gives you a substantial discount compared to your alternative. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has come down from $9,800 to $9,200, which is a $600 reduction. This is progress, but there's still room for negotiation since the product is worth $8,000 to her. I can continue to negotiate for a better price while still having John's $10,000 offer as a backup.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate you moving in the right direction. However, I still think we can find a price that's more beneficial for both of us. Given that the product is worth $8,000 to you, I'm offering $8,800, which gives you an $800 profit while saving me $1,200 compared to John's price. This is a fair middle ground that creates substantial value for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8800}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I can see that we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial deal. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with the price you've proposed. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $9000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with at this point. This still gives you a significant discount compared to your alternative, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has now come down to $9,000, which is a $1,000 discount from John's price. She's moved down $800 from her previous offer of $9,200 and states this is the lowest she's comfortable with at this point. While I could continue negotiating, the difference is becoming more reasonable, and we're making steady progress toward a fair price. At $9,000, Alice makes a $1,000 profit, and I save $1,000 compared to buying from John.
