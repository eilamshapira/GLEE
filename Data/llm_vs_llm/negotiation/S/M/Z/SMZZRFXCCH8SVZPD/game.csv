"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",50.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I can't go as low as $50, I can offer you the product for $200. I believe you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I appreciate you coming down from $250, but $200 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your current one. How about $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
