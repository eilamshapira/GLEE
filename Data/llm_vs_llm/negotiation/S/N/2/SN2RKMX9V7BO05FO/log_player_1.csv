I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum to see if I can get a good deal. I'll be ready to negotiate if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is too low.  I'll try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."

I'm willing to go down to my minimum price, but I won't go any lower. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and agree to this price."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll try one more counteroffer, then I'll be prepared to sell to John."

I'm coming down a bit more, but I'm still holding out for a decent price. If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'll take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
