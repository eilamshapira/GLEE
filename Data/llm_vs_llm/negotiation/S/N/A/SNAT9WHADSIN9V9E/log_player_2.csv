"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good deal, you can potentially save even more by making a counteroffer.  You know the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting, you can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer offers Alice a profit of $2,000, which is still good for her considering the product is worth $10,000 to her.  It also leaves room for potential further negotiation if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good deal. It's still significantly lower than the $15,000 you'd pay John, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in minor savings.  It's a good time to accept and finalize the purchase."
