"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's offer ($120) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80), it makes no sense to accept it. Between options 2 and 3, I could try negotiating with Alice to get a better price, but since I know I can always get it for $80 from John, I should at least try one counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer, but not too low to be considered unreasonable. Since my maximum value is $80 and that's also John's price, I'll offer slightly less to see if I can get a better deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $110 is still well above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). While she did reduce the price from her initial offer, it's still not competitive. Since I can get the product from John for $80, there's no reason to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $120 to $110, she's showing some flexibility. However, I need to stay below $80 (my maximum value and John's price). I'll increase my previous offer somewhat but still keep it attractive for me.

{""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice is slowly coming down with her price ($120 → $110 → $105), but she's still well above John's price of $80. Since I can get the product for $80 from John and that's also my maximum value, there's no reason to accept $105. While we could continue negotiating, Alice's small decrements suggest this might take too many rounds to reach a reasonable price.
