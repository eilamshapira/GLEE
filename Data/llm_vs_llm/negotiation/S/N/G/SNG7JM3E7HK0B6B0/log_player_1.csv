Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully balance setting a price that maximizes my profit without pushing Bob away completely. Since I know the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me (and I have John as a backup buyer at exactly that price), I'll start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation while still potentially capturing more value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below my reservation value of $1,500,000, I'll counter with a price that moves toward Bob's range but still remains profitable for me. Given that I have John willing to pay $1,500,000, I need to stay above that price to make sense financially.
