"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'd like to offer you the product for $1000000. This represents a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair deal given the product's exclusivity. Let me know if you accept this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at her asking price, especially since you have another option to purchase the product for the same price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $500,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 500000}
