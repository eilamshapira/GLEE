"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Here's my decision-making process:

*   **Value to me:** $12,000 (maximum I'm willing to pay)
*   **Alice's Offer:** $11,000
*   **Buying from John:** $12,000

Since Alice's offer of $11,000 is less than the $12,000 I'm willing to pay and less than what John is offering, I should accept Alice's offer.
