"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I have a great product I think you'll really like. I'm offering it to you for $200."",
  ""product_price"": 200
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Okay, I've considered Bob's counteroffer of $100. That's less than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I have 8 rounds left, and I believe I can get a better offer.

Therefore, my decision is:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob for Round 3:

```json
{
  ""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go as low as $100. How about $180?"",
  ""product_price"": 180
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  I could go up to $120.  Does that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Okay, Bob's offer of $120 is equal to the price John is offering. I'm indifferent between the two options. I have 6 rounds left, and there's a chance I could get a slightly better price from Bob, but there's also a risk of getting a worse one or wasting more time. Given the uncertainty, I'll take the sure thing.

Therefore, my decision is:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```"
