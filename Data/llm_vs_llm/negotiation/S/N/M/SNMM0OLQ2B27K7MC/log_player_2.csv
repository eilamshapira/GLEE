"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. If you're interested, please let me know, and we can discuss the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering the product for $14,999
3. John is offering the same product for $12,000

Alice's offer ($14,999) is:
- Higher than my maximum value ($12,000)
- Higher than John's alternative offer ($12,000)

Since I don't want to pay more than the product is worth to me, and John's offer is both within my budget and cheaper than Alice's offer, the logical choice is to buy from John.
