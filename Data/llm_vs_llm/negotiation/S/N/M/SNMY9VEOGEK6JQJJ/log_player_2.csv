"Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $145 is close to your maximum budget, there's still room for negotiation.  You might be able to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer is a significant jump down from Alice's offer, but it still gives her a decent profit margin. It opens the door for further negotiation while demonstrating that you're serious about getting a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** $130 is a reasonable price, comfortably below your maximum and a good compromise from both your starting points. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better result, and it's better to secure the deal now."
