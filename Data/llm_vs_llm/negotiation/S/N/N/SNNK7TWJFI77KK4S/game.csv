"Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $20000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and potential benefits.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is above my budget for this product. I can offer you $5000 for it, considering my valuation.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5000 is significantly below the product's value. While I understand budget constraints, I need to be realistic about the product's worth. I can reduce my initial asking price to $15000, which is a substantial reduction and represents excellent value considering the product's quality.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for considering a lower price, Alice. However, $15000 is still beyond what I can spend. I could meet you at $6000, which I believe is a fair middle ground for both of us.",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and negotiation. However, I need to be transparent - I have another buyer willing to pay $10000 for this product, which represents my minimum acceptable price. If you're genuinely interested, I can offer it to you for $12000, which is a significant reduction from my previous offers. This price still gives you great value while being fair to me as the seller.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate the clarification. While I respect the other buyer's offer, my budget cap is $8000. I am prepared to match this amount if you are willing to close the deal swiftly.",8000.0,Bob,6,
