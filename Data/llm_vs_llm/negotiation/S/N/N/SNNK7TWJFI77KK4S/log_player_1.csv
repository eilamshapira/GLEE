"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $20,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and potential benefits."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is above my budget for this product. I can offer you $5000 for it, considering my valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's offer of $5,000 is too low, as it's even below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is significantly below the product's value. While I understand budget constraints, I need to be realistic about the product's worth. I can reduce my initial asking price to $15,000, which is a substantial reduction and represents excellent value considering the product's quality."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for considering a lower price, Alice. However, $15000 is still beyond what I can spend. I could meet you at $6000, which I believe is a fair middle ground for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's offer of $6,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and since I have John's guaranteed offer of $10,000, I need to see a significantly better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and negotiation. However, I need to be transparent - I have another buyer willing to pay $10,000 for this product, which represents my minimum acceptable price. If you're genuinely interested, I can offer it to you for $12,000, which is a significant reduction from my previous offers. This price still gives you great value while being fair to me as the seller."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and appreciate the clarification. While I respect the other buyer's offer, my budget cap is $8000. I am prepared to match this amount if you are willing to close the deal swiftly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's highest offer of $8,000 is still below John's guaranteed $10,000, and we've gone through several rounds of negotiation without reaching a price above $10,000, it makes the most financial sense to sell to John. Bob has indicated $8,000 is his budget cap, so continuing negotiations would likely not lead to a better outcome than John's offer."
