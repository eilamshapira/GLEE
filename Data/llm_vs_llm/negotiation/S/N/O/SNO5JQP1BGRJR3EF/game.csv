Hi Bob! I have a great product for you and I'm offering it at a fantastic value. How about purchasing it for $300?,300.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $300 is way out of my budget. I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget concerns, but $80 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $200?",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $200 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $120.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob. $120 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I can offer you this product for $170. It's a great value for what you're getting!",170.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $170 is still too much for me. Let's split the difference. I'll offer you $140.  What do you say?",140.0,Bob,6,
