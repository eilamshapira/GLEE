"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $200 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $120, and also higher than John's price of $120. It would be better to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If we can't reach a reasonable agreement with Alice, I always have the option to buy from John at $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 90}

I'll start with a low counteroffer of $90. Since Alice values the product at $150, and my maximum value is $120, there's room for negotiation between these prices. Starting low gives room for future negotiations while still being somewhat reasonable. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground, and I still have John's offer of $120 as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $180 is still well above both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120). While Alice has reduced the price from her initial $200 offer, it's still not close enough to be acceptable. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. If Alice continues to stay well above my maximum value, I can always fall back on John's offer of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 100}

I'll increase my offer slightly to $100. This shows some movement from my previous offer of $90 and demonstrates willingness to negotiate, while still staying well below my maximum value of $120. Since Alice values the product at $150, there might be room to find a mutually acceptable price. If Alice continues to maintain prices significantly above $120, I can still take John's offer of $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Here's why:
1. Alice's offers have only come down marginally ($200 → $180 → $170)
2. Her current offer of $170 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120)
3. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Alice's high offers suggest she's unlikely to come down to a price below $120
4. We're already halfway through our 10 rounds
5. John's offer of $120 is exactly at my maximum value, and it's a guaranteed deal

Rather than continue negotiations that don't seem to be converging to an acceptable price, it's better to take the known good option with John."
