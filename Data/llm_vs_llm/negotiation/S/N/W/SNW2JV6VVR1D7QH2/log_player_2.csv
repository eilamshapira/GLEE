"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this product for $120. I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to analyze Alice's offer to make a decision that maximizes my value.

Alice is offering the product for $120, but the product is only worth $100 to me. This means I would lose $20 in value if I accept this offer.

I also know that John is willing to sell me the same product for $100, which matches exactly what the product is worth to me.

Given these facts:
- Alice's offer ($120) exceeds my maximum value ($100)
- John offers exactly $100, which equals my maximum value
- I could make a counteroffer to Alice, but there's no guarantee she'll accept below $100

The rational choice is to either buy from John or make a counteroffer to Alice that's below $100.

Since John's offer is already at my maximum acceptable price, and guaranteed, I'll go with:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}"
