"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I find the initial price a bit high. I'm looking to spend no more than $4000 on this product. I understand the value it brings, but I need to work within my budget.",4000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that budget is a concern, but I'm afraid $4000 is too low for this product. Considering its exceptional value, I'm willing to make a concession and offer it to you for $22000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the product's worth.",22000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $22000 is still beyond my budget. I'm ready to increase my offer to $6000. This is moving closer to your asking price, and I hope we can find common ground soon.",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for increasing your offer, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. However, $6000 is still below my expectations. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $20000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",20000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your concessions. However, $20000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $7000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my budget constraints.",7000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your continued efforts to find a mutually acceptable price, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $7000 is still below my expectations. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer the product to you for $19000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value.",19000.0,Alice,7,
