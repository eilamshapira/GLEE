"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $25,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's quality and potential benefits. I'm open to negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I find the initial price a bit high. I'm looking to spend no more than $4000 on this product. I understand the value it brings, but I need to work within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $4,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate and try to reach a mutually acceptable price. Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed option, but I want to explore the possibility of getting a better price from Bob. 

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that budget is a concern, but I'm afraid $4,000 is too low for this product. Considering its exceptional value, I'm willing to make a concession and offer it to you for $22,000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that budget is a concern, but I'm afraid $4,000 is too low for this product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $22000 is still beyond my budget. I'm ready to increase my offer to $6000. This is moving closer to your asking price, and I hope we can find common ground soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $6,000 is still significantly lower than the product's value to me. While he has increased his offer, it's not enough to meet my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer. I still have 6 rounds left to negotiate and try to reach a mutually acceptable price. Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed option, but I want to explore the possibility of getting a better price from Bob.

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thank you for increasing your offer, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. However, $6,000 is still below my expectations. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $20,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your concessions. However, $20000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $7000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer of $7,000 is still significantly lower than the product's value to me. While he has increased his offer again, it's not enough to meet my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer. I still have 4 rounds left to negotiate and try to reach a mutually acceptable price. Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed option, but I want to explore the possibility of getting a better price from Bob.

However, I will start to be more cautious in my concessions, as Bob's offers are increasing at a slow pace. I will make a smaller concession this time to test Bob's willingness to meet me halfway.

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your continued efforts to find a mutually acceptable price, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $7,000 is still below my expectations.
