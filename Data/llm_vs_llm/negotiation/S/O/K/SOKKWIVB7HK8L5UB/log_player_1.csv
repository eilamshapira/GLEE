Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 100}

Since the product is worth $100 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $100, there's no reason for me to offer Bob a lower price. If Bob accepts, I get $100, and if he rejects, I still get $100 from John. The fact that the product is only worth $80 to Bob means he will likely reject my offer, but this doesn't affect my optimal strategy since I have John as a backup buyer."
