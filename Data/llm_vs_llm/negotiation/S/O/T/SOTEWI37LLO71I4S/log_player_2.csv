"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you, as I believe it will be of great value to you. I'm asking $150 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","$150 is significantly higher than my maximum valuation of $80 for the product. Furthermore, I know I can get it from John for $80 with certainty. There's no reason to accept this offer or even continue negotiating at such a high price point.
