"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to offer you my product for $150. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's initial offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay ($150), and I want to save as much money as possible, I'll choose to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, to see how much room there is for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must insist on a price of $150. This is the fair value for this product, and it's the best I can do. Let me know if you're ready to proceed at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","It seems like Alice is not willing to budge much from her initial offer. Since I still want to try to save some money, I'll reject her offer again and try to make a more reasonable counteroffer.

This time, I'll increase my offer to $120, which is still below Alice's asking price but shows that I'm willing to compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

(Note: I'll send the counteroffer in the next round)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","As I mentioned earlier, I'll increase my offer to $120, which is still below Alice's asking price but shows that I'm willing to compromise.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand that you think the product is worth $150, but I'm still not comfortable paying that much. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your asking price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
