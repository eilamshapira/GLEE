"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's offer of $2,500,000 is significantly higher than the maximum value of $800,000 that the product is worth to me. It also exceeds John's price of $800,000. Since John is willing to sell me the same product for $800,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay, I should choose the option that saves me the most money.
