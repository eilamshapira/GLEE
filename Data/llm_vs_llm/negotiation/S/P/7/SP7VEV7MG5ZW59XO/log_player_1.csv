Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $14,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product but $14500 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob since his offer is only at my minimum acceptable price, and I know the product is worth more to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is too low for this product's value. I understand your concern about the initial price, so I'm willing to reduce it to $13,500, which I believe is a fair compromise that would benefit both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $12750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $12,750. This is better than my alternative of selling to John for $12,000, and given the back-and-forth negotiation, it might be difficult to get Bob to agree to a significantly higher price without risking losing the deal altogether."
