"Alice, your offer is significantly above my budget. While I understand the value you're placing on this product, I'm only willing to pay up to $800000.  I'm genuinely interested in this product, but this is the highest price I'm comfortable with. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. The product has a market value that's much higher, and I already have another buyer willing to pay $1500000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can reduce my initial price to $2800000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to discuss further.",2800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2800000 is still outside of my budget.  While I see the value in the product, I can only go up to $1500000.  This offer is based on my understanding of the market value and the fact that I have a backup option with John. Let me know if this is a price we can work with.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer of $1500000, which matches what John is willing to pay. However, since I can already get that amount from John, I'd need a higher offer from you to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down significantly from my previous ask to $2200000. This represents a substantial discount from my initial offer and reflects my genuine interest in working with you instead of John. Given the product's true value and potential return on investment for you, I believe this is a fair price. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate the compromise.  However, $2200000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1800000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to working with you. If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to seriously consider my options with John.  What do you think?",1800000.0,Bob,6,
