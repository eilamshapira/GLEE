Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is significantly above my budget. While I understand the value you're placing on this product, I'm only willing to pay up to $800000.  I'm genuinely interested in this product, but this is the highest price I'm comfortable with. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. The product has a market value that's much higher, and I already have another buyer willing to pay $1,500,000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can reduce my initial price to $2,800,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2800000 is still outside of my budget.  While I see the value in the product, I can only go up to $1500000.  This offer is based on my understanding of the market value and the fact that I have a backup option with John. Let me know if this is a price we can work with.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer of $1,500,000, which matches what John is willing to pay. However, since I can already get that amount from John, I'd need a higher offer from you to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down significantly from my previous ask to $2,200,000. This represents a substantial discount from my initial offer and reflects my genuine interest in working with you instead of John. Given the product's true value and potential return on investment for you, I believe this is a fair price. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2200000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and appreciate the compromise.  However, $2200000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1800000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to working with you. If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to seriously consider my options with John.
