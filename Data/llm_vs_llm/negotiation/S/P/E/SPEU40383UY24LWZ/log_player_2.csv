Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be beneficial for you. It's a high-quality item with exceptional value. I'm offering it to you for $3500000. This price reflects the product's market value and potential return on investment. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,500,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far too high. I will reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is significantly above my budget. While I understand the value you're placing on this product, I'm only willing to pay up to $800,000.  I'm genuinely interested in this product, but this is the highest price I'm comfortable with. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. The product has a market value that's much higher, and I already have another buyer willing to pay $1500000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can reduce my initial price to $2800000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm getting closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,800,000 is still outside of my budget.  While I see the value in the product, I can only go up to $1,500,000.  This offer is based on my understanding of the market value and the fact that I have a backup option with John. Let me know if this is a price we can work with."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer of $1500000, which matches what John is willing to pay. However, since I can already get that amount from John, I'd need a higher offer from you to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down significantly from my previous ask to $2200000. This represents a substantial discount from my initial offer and reflects my genuine interest in working with you instead of John. Given the product's true value and potential return on investment for you, I believe this is a fair price. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high, but she's definitely getting closer. I'll counteroffer one last time before seriously considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position and appreciate the compromise.  However, $2,200,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,800,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to working with you. If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to seriously consider my options with John.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
