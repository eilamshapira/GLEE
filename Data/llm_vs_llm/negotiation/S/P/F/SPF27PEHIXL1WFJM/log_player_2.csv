"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is significantly higher than my budget and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate down and see if I can get a better price from Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a relatively low offer, less than half of Alice's initial price. This leaves room for negotiation while still being a significant saving if accepted."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice came down slightly, $14,000 is still significantly higher than both my target price and John's offer. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 7500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down slowly, but $13,500 is still too high. We're getting closer to the halfway point in the negotiation, and I need to push for a more significant price drop."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm making a more significant jump in my offer to signal to Alice that I'm serious about getting a price closer to my budget. This offer is still below John's price but shows a willingness to compromise."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show some flexibility, but this is my final offer.  If Alice rejects this, I'll take John's offer in the next round. This puts the pressure on Alice to make a decision."
