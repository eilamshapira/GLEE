"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what the product is worth to you. It makes much more sense to negotiate or go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
``` 

This is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it allows room for negotiation while still being a good deal for me if accepted."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but very slowly. It's still more beneficial to continue negotiating rather than accepting a price this high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

We're increasing our offer to show Alice we're willing to move, but we're still staying well below her current price to encourage her to meet us closer to the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating, but the price is still too high. We're getting closer to John's price, but there's still room for Alice to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

We're increasing our offer again, but in smaller increments now. This signals that we're getting closer to our upper limit, while still aiming for a price below John's."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

The price is getting tempting, but we're playing a game of chicken now. Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and we're only $3,000 apart with three rounds left. John's price is looking more and more appealing, but there's still a chance to get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

This offer is a bit of a gamble. It's a significant jump from our previous offer, signaling to Alice that we're getting serious and nearing our limit. It's still below John's price, but it leaves very little room for further negotiation. We're betting that Alice is getting anxious as we approach the end and might accept."
