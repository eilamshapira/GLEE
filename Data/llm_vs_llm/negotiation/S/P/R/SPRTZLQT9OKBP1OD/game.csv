"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the current market conditions. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'd like to start with this offer.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on market conditions, I need to consider my investment in this product. I can come down from my initial price, but $900000 is too low considering the product's value. I can offer it for $1000000, which I believe is a fair middle ground and would still provide you with significant profit potential. Would you consider this price?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for reconsidering and coming down from your initial price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think $1000000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. This price takes into account the product's value and my own financial constraints, while also leaving some room for profit. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
