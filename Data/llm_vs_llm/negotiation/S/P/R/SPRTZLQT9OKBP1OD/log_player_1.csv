Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the current market conditions. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'd like to start with this offer.

While I understand your perspective on market conditions, I need to consider my investment in this product.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for reconsidering and coming down from your initial price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think $1000000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. This price takes into account the product's value and my own financial constraints, while also leaving some room for profit. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.
