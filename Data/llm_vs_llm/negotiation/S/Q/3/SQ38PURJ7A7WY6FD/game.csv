"Hello Bob, I have a quality product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it for $180. This is a fair price considering the product's features and quality. I'm open to discussing the price, but I'm confident this represents good value.",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'll get from the product.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $90 is too low for me considering the quality and value of what I'm offering. I understand you have budget constraints, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price as well. I can come down to $160. This is still a great value for what you're getting, and I hope we can meet somewhere that works for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my budget and coming down to $160. However, I still feel that's a bit above what I'm comfortable paying. I'd like to meet you halfway between my original offer and your current price. I'm willing to go up to $100. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $100, which shows your interest in the product. However, that's still below what I can accept for this item. Given that I have another buyer willing to pay $120, I need to be at least at that price point. I can come down to $145, which is still a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents excellent value for the quality you're receiving. Can we find a middle ground that works for both of us?",145.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for sharing the information about the other buyer and for coming down to $145. However, I'm still not comfortable paying that price. Given that I have the option to buy the product from another seller for $120, I'd like to make a counteroffer that's closer to that price point. I'm willing to pay $115, which I believe is a fair price considering the market value and the fact that I'm a serious buyer. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for increasing your offer to $115. I understand you mentioned having another option at $120, which is interesting because I also have another buyer (John) who's ready to pay $120. Given that we're so close in price, and considering the time we've both invested in this negotiation, I'd like to offer you the product at $125. This is very close to the market rate you mentioned, and allows me to make a slightly better deal than my alternative. I hope we can finalize at this price and move forward.",125.0,Alice,7,
