Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a quality product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it for $180. This is a fair price considering the product's features and quality. I'm open to discussing the price, but I'm confident this represents good value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $90 is too low for me considering the quality and value of what I'm offering. I understand you have budget constraints, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price as well. I can come down to $160. This is still a great value for what you're getting, and I hope we can meet somewhere that works for both of us.

Round 4

I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 100}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $100, which shows your interest in the product. However, that's still below what I can accept for this item. Given that I have another buyer willing to pay $120, I need to be at least at that price point. I can come down to $145, which is still a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents excellent value for the quality you're receiving. Can we find a middle ground that works for both of us? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for sharing the information about the other buyer and for coming down to $145. However, I'm still not comfortable paying that price. Given that I have the option to buy the product from another seller for $120, I'd like to make a counteroffer that's closer to that price point. I'm willing to pay $115, which I believe is a fair price considering the market value and the fact that I'm a serious buyer. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for increasing your offer to $115. I understand you mentioned having another option at $120, which is interesting because I also have another buyer (John) who's ready to pay $120. Given that we're so close in price, and considering the time we've both invested in this negotiation, I'd like to offer you the product at $125. This is very close to the market rate you mentioned, and allows me to make a slightly better deal than my alternative. I hope we can finalize at this price and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.
