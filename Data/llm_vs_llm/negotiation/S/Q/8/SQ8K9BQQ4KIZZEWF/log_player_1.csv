"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I don't go below my minimum threshold of $1,200,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $800,000 as it's well below my minimum threshold of $1,200,000. Since I can guarantee $1,200,000 from John, and Bob's offer is significantly lower than that, I'll just sell to John now rather than continue negotiations that might not reach my minimum threshold.
