"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's make a counteroffer to Alice. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to me and $1,200,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. I'll start with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.

Counteroffer: $800,000"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
