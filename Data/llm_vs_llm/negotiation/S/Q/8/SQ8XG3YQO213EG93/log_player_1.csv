Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the potential value of this product,  $1800000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the market value of similar products. Let me know your thoughts.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is considerably below the product's value and my bottom line. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the product's worth. I have another buyer willing to pay $1,200,000, but I'd prefer to work with you. I can come down to $1,550,000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true value. How does this sound?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1550000 is closer to my budget, it's still a stretch.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $1150000. This price reflects the product's value while staying within my financial constraints. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest and for moving closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. Your offer of $1,150,000 is getting closer, but I need to point out that I already have an offer of $1,200,000 from another buyer. I'm still interested in working with you, but I would need at least $1,300,000 to choose your offer over the existing one. This still represents a significant reduction from my initial price and reflects a fair value for this product. I hope we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1300000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1200000, which is the same as the other buyer's offer.  I believe this shows good faith and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal with you. Let's work together to finalize this agreement.

That demonstrates your serious interest in acquiring this product. However, if the price is the same, I would need some additional incentive to choose your offer over the other buyer's, who is ready to complete the transaction immediately. I can accept $1,250,000, which is just slightly above the competing offer but would make it worthwhile for me to continue our negotiation rather than concluding the deal with the other party.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
