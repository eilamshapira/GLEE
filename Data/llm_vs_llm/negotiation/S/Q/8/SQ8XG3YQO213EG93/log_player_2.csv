{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the potential value of this product,  $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is considerably below the product's value and my bottom line. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the product's worth. I have another buyer willing to pay $1200000, but I'd prefer to work with you. I can come down to $1550000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true value. How does this sound?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

Round 4

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,550,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a stretch.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $1,150,000. This price reflects the product's value while staying within my financial constraints. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest and for moving closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. Your offer of $1150000 is getting closer, but I need to point out that I already have an offer of $1200000 from another buyer. I'm still interested in working with you, but I would need at least $1300000 to choose your offer over the existing one. This still represents a significant reduction from my initial price and reflects a fair value for this product. I hope we can find common ground at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000, which is the same as the other buyer's offer.  I believe this shows good faith and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal with you. Let's work together to finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to match the other buyer's offer of $1200000. That demonstrates your serious interest in acquiring this product. However, if the price is the same, I would need some additional incentive to choose your offer over the other buyer's, who is ready to complete the transaction immediately. I can accept $1250000, which is just slightly above the competing offer but would make it worthwhile for me to continue our negotiation rather than concluding the deal with the other party. This represents my final offer and is still significantly lower than my initial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000, which is a good compromise.  It's a fair price that allows both of us to make a deal and move forward. I'm confident we can close this deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1225000}
