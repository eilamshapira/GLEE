"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, my budget is a bit tight. I'm willing to buy it for $80. Let me know if this works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $80 is the absolute minimum I could accept, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. However, this product offers excellent value, and I'd be willing to come down to $110. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, reflecting my interest in working with you rather than my other buyer.",110.0,Alice,3,
