"Hi Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but the price you're asking is beyond my budget. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I can only go up to $600000. Let me know if this works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that my initial price may have been out of your budget, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1800000. If this is still not feasible for you, please let me know and we can discuss further.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value you place on the product, $1800000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $700000. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $700000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than your current offer. I'm willing to compromise and make a counteroffer of $1500000. This is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth. If you're interested in purchasing, I hope we can meet at this price.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility in lowering the price to $1500000, but it's still beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $750000 as my final offer. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options. Please let me know if we can close the deal at this price.",750000.0,Bob,6,
