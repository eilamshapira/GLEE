Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but the price you're asking is beyond my budget. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I can only go up to $600000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as his offer of $600,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price. 

My counteroffer: $1,800,000 

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me at this price or if he'll make another counteroffer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value you place on the product, $1800000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $700000. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob. While he has increased his offer to $700,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to find a mutually beneficial price.

My counteroffer: $1,500,000 

This price is lower than my previous offer, but still reflects the product's value. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me at this price or if he'll make another counteroffer."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility in lowering the price to $1500000, but it's still beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $750000 as my final offer. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options. Please let me know if we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's final offer of $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Considering I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1,200,000, it's a more attractive option. I don't want to risk losing the deal with John by continuing to negotiate with Bob, who may not be willing or able to meet my price expectations. Selling to John guarantees a higher price, which aligns with my goal of earning as much money as possible for the product."
