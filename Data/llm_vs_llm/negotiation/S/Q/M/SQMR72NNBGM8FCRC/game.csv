"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the product's potential value, but $1500000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $600000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and constraints.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $600000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price. I'm prepared to accept $1200000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and reflects my desire to reach an agreement with you.  Let me know if you're interested in this price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and lower the price to $1200000. However, this is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this price reflects a fair value for the product and demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring it.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, and your offer of $900000 is getting closer to what I'm looking for. However, it's still below what I consider a fair value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1050000.  This would be a significant investment for you, but I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $1050000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to come up on your offer.  $950000 is getting closer to what I need, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer a price of $1000000. This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my desire to come to an agreement with you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,7,
