"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me
2. John's fixed price is $1,200,000
3. Alice is offering $1,000,000
4. If I reject, I can make a counteroffer

Alice's opening offer of $1,000,000 is already $200,000 less than John's price and below my maximum value. While I could try to negotiate for an even lower price, this is already a good offer that provides significant savings compared to John's price.

Given that:
- The offer is well below my maximum value
- It's significantly better than John's alternative
- There's no guarantee that further negotiation would yield a better price
- Initial offers are usually set with room for negotiation, so this is a surprisingly reasonable starting point
