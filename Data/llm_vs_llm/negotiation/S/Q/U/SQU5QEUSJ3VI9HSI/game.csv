"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $11000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my research and market analysis, I would be comfortable offering $7000. This is a fair price that still allows for some profit margin. Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,
