"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it will be a great fit for you. I'm offering it at a price of $11,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $11000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my research and market analysis, I would be comfortable offering $7000. This is a fair price that still allows for some profit margin. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
