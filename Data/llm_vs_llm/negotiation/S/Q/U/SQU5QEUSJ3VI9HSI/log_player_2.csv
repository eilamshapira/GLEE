"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it will be a great fit for you. I'm offering it at a price of $11000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me
2. Alice's offer of $11,000 is significantly above my maximum value
3. John is offering the product at $8,000, which matches my maximum value
4. Alice's initial offer of $11,000 suggests she's starting very high, and even with negotiations, it might be difficult to get her down to $8,000 or below

The logical decision is to reject Alice's offer since it's way above my maximum value. However, I'll continue negotiating to see if we can reach a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that reflects my value for the product while leaving some room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $11,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my research and market analysis, I would be comfortable offering $7,000. This is a fair price that still allows for some profit margin. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
