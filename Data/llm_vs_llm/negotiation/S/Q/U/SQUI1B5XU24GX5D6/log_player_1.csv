Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $25000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $6000 for the product.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

My goal is to maximize profit, and I know the product is worth at least $12,000 to me. Accepting $6,000 would be a loss. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for reconsidering, Alice. I understand the product's value, but I am unable to stretch to $22000. I can improve my previous offer and can go up to $7000.

My best course of action is to prioritize profit. I will reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.
