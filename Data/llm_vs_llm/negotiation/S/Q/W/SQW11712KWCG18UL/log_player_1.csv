Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $90 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I have the option to sell to John for $120, I will consider my next step carefully.

Given that my goal is to earn as much money as possible for the product, and Bob's initial offer is $30 less than what I can get from John, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I also don't want to immediately sell to John without trying to negotiate a better price with Bob, in case Bob is willing to increase his offer.

Therefore, my decision is to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me at a higher price point.

My counteroffer will be $110, which is still below what John is offering but gives Bob a chance to reconsider and potentially increase his offer.
