"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is quite high for me. I've seen similar products for much less. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. This would still give you a good return while being more affordable for me. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but $100 is lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal that works for both of us. How about we settle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice. However, $140 is still more than I can justify spending. I've actually found the same product elsewhere for $120. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can offer $110, which is higher than my initial offer. This would be a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for sharing that you found the product elsewhere for $120. I appreciate your honesty and willingness to work with me. Considering this, I'm willing to make a more significant concession. I can offer the product to you for $125, which is lower than my previous offer and takes into account the price you mentioned. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, so I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",125.0,Alice,5,
