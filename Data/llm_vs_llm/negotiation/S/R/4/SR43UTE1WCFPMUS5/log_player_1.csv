"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is quite high for me. I've seen similar products for much less. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. This would still give you a good return while being more affordable for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, hoping to find a mutually beneficial price. Since the product is worth at least $150 to me, I'm not willing to accept $100, and selling to John for $150 is still an option if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but $100 is lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal that works for both of us. How about we settle at $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice. However, $140 is still more than I can justify spending. I've actually found the same product elsewhere for $120. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can offer $110, which is higher than my initial offer. This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since he mentioned that he found the same product elsewhere for $120, which is closer to my target price, I'll try to meet him at that point or slightly lower, but still higher than his current offer of $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for sharing that you found the product elsewhere for $120. I appreciate your honesty and willingness to work with me. Considering this, I'm willing to make a more significant concession. I can offer the product to you for $125, which is lower than my previous offer and takes into account the price you mentioned. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, so I hope we can finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 125}"
