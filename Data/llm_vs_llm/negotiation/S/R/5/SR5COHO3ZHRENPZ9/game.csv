"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $12000. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $12000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking an interest in the product.  While $9000 is lower than what I'd like to get, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $10500?  This would still leave me with a decent profit, and it's a fair price considering the value you'll get out of it.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $10500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current one.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  $9500 is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference again and go with $10000. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower.",10000.0,Alice,5,
