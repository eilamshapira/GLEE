"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 300}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","$50 is far too low and below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Since Bob's opening offer is so low, it suggests he might not be negotiating in good faith. However, I'll reject and make one more counteroffer before considering selling to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll significantly lower my initial price to show flexibility but still maintain a good margin above my minimum of $150.

{""product_price"": 225}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob has only increased his offer by $25 (from $50 to $75), which is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Given that we're now in round 4 and Bob's offers are still very low, it would be best to take the guaranteed $150 from John rather than continue this negotiation that shows little promise.
