"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows for negotiation space. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,750,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
