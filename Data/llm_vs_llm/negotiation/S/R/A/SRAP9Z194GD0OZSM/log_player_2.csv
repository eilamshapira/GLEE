"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given the current market conditions and the product's exceptional quality, I'm offering it to you for $1400000. This is a competitive price considering its true value and potential. Would you like to proceed with the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than her product's value to her, it's still more than you want to pay. You know John will sell it for $1,200,000, making it the better deal."
