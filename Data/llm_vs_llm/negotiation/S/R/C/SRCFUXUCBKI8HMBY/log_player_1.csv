"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love! I'm willing to let it go for $200."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Okay, this is where it gets tricky! I need to balance maximizing profit with the risk of Bob walking away. I know he values it at $100 and I value it at $150. $70 is definitely too low.

Considering the options:

*   **(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70:** This is a loss.
*   **(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer:** This is the most likely choice for me. I can try and get closer to my minimum.
*   **(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150:** A guaranteed profit, but I could potentially get more from Bob.

Given the information I have, I'll proceed with the negotiation and attempt to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate it! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $70 is too low for me. How about $180?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. I can offer $85. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Alright, this is another crucial point. $85 is still very low. Considering the options:

*   **(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85:** This is a loss.
*   **(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer:** The risk here is Bob gets tired of negotiating and walks away.
*   **(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150:** The safest option.

Since I've already put some time in with Bob, I will continue to negotiate for a price closer to my minimum.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate that. How about we meet in the middle? I'll go down to $170."", ""product_price"": 170}"
