"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value you see in the product, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to offer $10000 for it, which I believe is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $10,000 because it's lower than the minimum value I have for the product, which is $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can meet at a mutually beneficial price. I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you have a limited budget, but I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to lower my initial offer, but not as low as $10,000. Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering adjusting the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $12000? I believe this is closer to a middle ground for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $12,000. Although it's closer to my initial offer, it's still below the price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value. Since Bob is willing to increase his offer, I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous one, hoping to meet Bob's budget and my own valuation. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. I'm getting closer to considering it, but I need a bit more. How about $16,000? It's a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. I'm getting closer to considering it, but I need a bit more. I'm willing to make a small concession, hoping we can finalize the deal.
