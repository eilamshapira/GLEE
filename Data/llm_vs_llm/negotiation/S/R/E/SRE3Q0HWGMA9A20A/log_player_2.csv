Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its features and value, I believe a starting price of $15000 is fair. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $15000 reflects the true value, I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is a significant reduction and I'm confident it's a fair offer considering the quality and benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit away from that number. Would you consider $10,000? That's a strong offer on my end."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's meet in the middle at $12000. This is my final offer, as it reflects the absolute lowest price I can accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's unlikely Alice will go below $12,000, and that's my maximum budget if I want to buy from her. John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000, saving me a significant amount."
