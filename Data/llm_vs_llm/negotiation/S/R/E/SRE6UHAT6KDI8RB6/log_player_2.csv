"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","The product is worth no more than $80 to me, and Alice is asking for $150. That's way too high. I'd rather buy from John for $80 than pay $150 to Alice.
