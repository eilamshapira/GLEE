"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer ($15,000) is higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000), it would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. Given that John is offering the product at exactly my maximum value, and it's less than Alice's offer, I should buy from John.
