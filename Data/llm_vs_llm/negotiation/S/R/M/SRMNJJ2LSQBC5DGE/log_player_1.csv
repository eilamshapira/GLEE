Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. However, given that I've done my market research, I believe we can find a price point that works better for both of us. Your product is valuable, but I'd like to propose $1050000 for it. This still provides you with a healthy profit margin while being more aligned with market rates. What are your thoughts on this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
