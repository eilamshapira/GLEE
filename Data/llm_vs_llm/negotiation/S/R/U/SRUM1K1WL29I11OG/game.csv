"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $180 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you have budget constraints, but $120 is too low considering the value of this product. I can come down to $160, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. This product is of exceptional quality and durability, making it a worthwhile investment. Would you be able to meet me at this price?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $140. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. ",140.0,Bob,4,
