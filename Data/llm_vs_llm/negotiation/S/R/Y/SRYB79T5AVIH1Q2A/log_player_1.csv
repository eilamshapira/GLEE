Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in my product. I appreciate your offer of $800,000, but unfortunately that's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. The product has a market value well above that amount, and I already have another buyer, John, willing to pay $1,200,000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can reduce my initial price to $1,500,000, which I believe is fair considering the product's quality and value. Please let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
