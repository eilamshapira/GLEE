"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this exclusive product at a price of $1200000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it will bring great value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is below my maximum budget of $1,500,000, I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to try to negotiate a better price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the hopes of getting a more favorable deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, in an attempt to gauge her flexibility and potentially get a better deal.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
