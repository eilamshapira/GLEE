Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at that price, I'll start with a higher price to test Bob's willingness to pay.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 (and below John's guaranteed offer), I will reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

My next counteroffer will be lower than my initial offer but still above my minimum threshold.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer of $700,000 is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at a higher price, there's no reason to accept this lower offer.
