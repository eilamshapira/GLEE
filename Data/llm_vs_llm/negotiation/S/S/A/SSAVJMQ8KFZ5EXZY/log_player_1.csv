"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 1,800,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 (John's offer), so I cannot accept it. However, since Bob showed interest and made a counteroffer, there's still potential to negotiate a better price than John's offer.

In the next round, I will make a new counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still maintain a price significantly above my minimum to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 1,500,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob has moved up to match John's price of $1,200,000, this shows he has room to go higher. There's no risk in making another counteroffer since I can always fall back on either Bob's or John's $1,200,000 offer later. I'll continue negotiating to try to secure a better price.

In the next round, I will make a new counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob has shown willingness to increase his offer significantly from $1,000,000 to $1,200,000, I'll try a more moderate decrease from my previous offer to find a middle ground.

{""product_price"": 1,350,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John. Bob's latest offer of $1,150,000 is lower than John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000, and Bob's decreasing counteroffer (from $1,200,000 to $1,150,000) suggests he's becoming less willing to increase his price. Rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that might not lead to a better offer, I'll take the certain $1,200,000 from John."
