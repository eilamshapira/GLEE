"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I believe will bring immense value to you. After careful consideration, I've decided to offer it to you for a price that I think is fair and reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $1,750,000, I need to evaluate if this makes sense for me.

The product is worth at most $1,000,000 to me, so paying $1,750,000 would mean I'm losing $750,000 in value. 

I could reject and make a counteroffer, but I also have the option to buy from John for exactly $1,000,000, which matches the maximum value of the product to me.

Since John's price is already at my maximum valuation point, and Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than even what the product is worth to her ($1,500,000), the rational choice is to buy from John.
