"Hello Bob, I have a quality product available for purchase. I believe it offers great value and I'm offering it to you for $150. This is a fair price considering the product's worth. Are you interested?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is quite high for my budget. I can get a similar product elsewhere for $100. But I'd like to work with you if possible. Would you consider selling it for $80? This would make it worth my while to buy from you rather than other sellers.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget concerns, I cannot sell for $80 as that's below my cost. Bob mentioned you can get a similar product for $100 elsewhere, and that's actually the minimum I can accept for this item due to its quality and my costs. However, since you're interested in working together, I can offer it to you at $120, which is still significantly lower than my initial offer and represents good value for the quality you're getting. Would this work for you?",120.0,Alice,3,
