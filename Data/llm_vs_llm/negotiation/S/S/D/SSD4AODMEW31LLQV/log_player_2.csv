"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a quality product available for purchase. I believe it offers great value and I'm offering it to you for $150. This is a fair price considering the product's worth. Are you interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I'll analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me
2. John is willing to sell it for $100
3. Alice is offering it for $150, which is $50 more than my maximum value
4. Alice's price is also $50 more than John's price

Given these facts:
- I would lose money by accepting Alice's offer of $150
- I can always buy from John for $100
- There's a chance I could negotiate with Alice for a better price, but even if I can't, I have John as a backup option

I'll reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate for a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is quite high for my budget. I can get a similar product elsewhere for $100. But I'd like to work with you if possible. Would you consider selling it for $80? This would make it worth my while to buy from you rather than other sellers."", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget concerns, I cannot sell for $80 as that's below my cost. Bob mentioned you can get a similar product for $100 elsewhere, and that's actually the minimum I can accept for this item due to its quality and my costs. However, since you're interested in working together, I can offer it to you at $120, which is still significantly lower than my initial offer and represents good value for the quality you're getting. Would this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let's analyze the situation:

1. Alice has dropped her price from $150 to $120
2. The product is still worth no more than $100 to me
3. John is still offering it for $100
4. Alice mentioned $100 is her minimum, suggesting further negotiation might not yield better results
5. Alice's current offer ($120) is still above both my maximum value and John's price

Since:
- Alice's price is still $20 more than John's price
- Alice indicated $100 is her minimum
- I can get the same product from John for $100
- There's no reason to pay more than $100 for something worth $100 to me

The rational choice is to buy from John.
