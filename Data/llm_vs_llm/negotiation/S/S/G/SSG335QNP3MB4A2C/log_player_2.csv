"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to decide on Alice's offer of $15,000 for the product.

This offer is significantly higher than the $10,000 the product is worth to me. It's also higher than John's guaranteed price of $10,000.

Since Alice is asking for $5,000 more than what the product is worth to me, and $5,000 more than John's price, this offer doesn't make economic sense to accept.

I should either buy from John immediately or attempt to negotiate with Alice for a better price.

Given that I have 10 rounds of negotiation available, I'll try to negotiate with Alice first.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but below John's price to save money.

{""product_price"": $8,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer of $12,000.

Alice has reduced her price from $15,000 to $12,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this price is still $2,000 higher than John's guaranteed price of $10,000, and $2,000 more than what the product is worth to me.

Since I still have several negotiation rounds remaining, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer to try to get a better price than John's $10,000 option.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer slightly but still aim to get a price below John's price.

{""product_price"": $9,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer of $11,000.

Alice has lowered her price again to $11,000, which shows she's continuing to negotiate. However, this price is still $1,000 higher than John's guaranteed price of $10,000, and $1,000 more than what the product is worth to me.

Since John is offering the product at $10,000, which is exactly at my maximum valuation, and Alice's current offer exceeds this, the economically rational choice would be to either buy from John or try one more counteroffer.

Given that I still have negotiation rounds remaining, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer to see if I can get a price below $10,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make one more attempt to get a price below John's offer.

{""product_price"": $9,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer of $10,500.

Alice has reduced her price further to $10,500, but this is still $500 more than John's guaranteed price of $10,000, and $500 more than what the product is worth to me maximally.

Since John is offering the product at $10,000, which matches my maximum valuation, and Alice's current offer still exceeds this, the economically rational choice is to buy from John. Alice doesn't seem willing to go below the $10,000 threshold, and continuing to negotiate would only waste time when I have a better option available.
