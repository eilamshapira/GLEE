"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $25000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","The initial offer of $25,000 is far above my maximum value of $8,000. Even considering negotiation, it's too high to be worth pursuing at this stage.
