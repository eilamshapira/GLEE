"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's a fantastic deal for both of us, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'd like to offer it to you for $80, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $80
2. John is selling the same product for $80
3. The product is worth $80 to me

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($80), and this equals my maximum valuation, I am indifferent between buying from either seller. In such a case, I might as well accept Alice's offer since she's already engaged in negotiation with me.
