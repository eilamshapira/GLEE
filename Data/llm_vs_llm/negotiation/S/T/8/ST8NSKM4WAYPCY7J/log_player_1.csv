"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since the product is worth $12,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a higher price to test Bob's willingness to pay.

{""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $8,000 since it's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and even below Bob's own valuation of $10,000. Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000, I can try another offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob rejected my initial high offer of $14,000 and countered with $8,000, I'll reduce my price but still keep it above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.

{""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer of $9,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Given that we've had several rounds of negotiation and Bob's offers are still well below my minimum, and I have a guaranteed offer from John at $12,000, I'll choose to sell to John now.
