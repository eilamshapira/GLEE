"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $2,500,000 is above my budget of $1,500,000, I will reject her offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm trying to save as much money as possible, I'll offer a price that is close to my target budget.

{""product_price"": $1,000,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $2,000,000 is still above my budget of $1,500,000. Since we are only in Round 3, I have plenty of time to negotiate and try to get a better price. I'll reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","In Round 2, I offered $1,000,000, and Alice rejected it. Then, she came back with a price of $2,000,000. This suggests that she may be willing to negotiate, but still wants a high price. I'll try to meet her halfway between my previous offer and her new price.

{""product_price"": $1,200,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $1,700,000 is still above my budget of $1,500,000, but it's getting closer. Since we are halfway through the negotiation rounds, I'll consider my options carefully. Buying from John for $1,500,000 is starting to look like a more attractive option, but I'll try to negotiate with Alice a bit more to see if I can get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","In Round 5, Alice offered $1,700,000, which is still above my target price. I'll try to make a counteroffer that is closer to my budget, but still reasonable. Since Alice has been gradually decreasing her price, I'll meet her halfway between her last offer and my target price.

{""product_price"": $1,450,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $1,600,000 is still above my budget of $1,500,000, but we're getting very close. At this point, I have to consider whether it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice or just buying from John for $1,500,000. Since I'm only $100,000 away from my target price, I'll think carefully about my next move.

Given that I have only 3 rounds left, I'll weigh my options. If I reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer, there's a risk that she might not accept it and we might not reach an agreement. On the other hand, buying from John for $1,500,000 guarantees that I'll get the product at a price I'm comfortable with.
