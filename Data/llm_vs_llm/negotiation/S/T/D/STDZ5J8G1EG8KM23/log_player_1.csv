"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Let's see what Bob's reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not satisfied with such a low price. I'll counter with a higher price, but I need to be strategic about how much I lower my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit. This counteroffer should be more appealing to Bob while still allowing me a decent margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, $7,500 still isn't ideal. I'm going to counter with a higher offer, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a better price. $8,500 is a reasonable compromise, and I hope Bob sees that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It seems we've hit a stalemate with Bob. While I'm not thrilled about selling for my minimum, the risk of further negotiation with Bob leading to a lower price is too high.  John is offering a guaranteed $8,000, which is the best I can get at this point."
