"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is quite high for this product. I have another seller offering the same product for $15000, but I'm interested in working with you. Would you consider $12000 for the product? This would be beneficial for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering my initial offer and for your interest in working with me. While I understand your perspective, the $15000 offer you received might not guarantee the same level of quality and service that I provide. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $17000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,
