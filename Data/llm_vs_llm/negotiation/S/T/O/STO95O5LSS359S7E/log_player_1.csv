Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is quite high for this product. I have another seller offering the same product for $15000, but I'm interested in working with you. Would you consider $12000 for the product? This would be beneficial for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

While I understand your perspective, the $15,000 offer you received might not guarantee the same level of quality and service that I provide. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
