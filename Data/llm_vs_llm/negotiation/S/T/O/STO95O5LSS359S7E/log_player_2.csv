"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us.  How about we start at $20000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $15,000, and it's also higher than John's guaranteed price of $15,000. It would be wise to reject this offer and make a counteroffer. If negotiations with Alice don't lead to a price below $15,000, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20,000 is quite high for this product. I have another seller offering the same product for $15,000, but I'm interested in working with you. Would you consider $12,000 for the product? This would be beneficial for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Reasoning: I'm starting with a counteroffer of $12,000 because:
1. It's well below my maximum value of $15,000
2. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, giving room for negotiation
3. I mentioned the competing offer of $15,000 to establish a credible ceiling
4. Starting low allows room for potential back-and-forth negotiation while still staying under my maximum price
5. If Alice rejects this, we can still negotiate upward while remaining under $15,000"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering my initial offer and for your interest in working with me. While I understand your perspective, the $15000 offer you received might not guarantee the same level of quality and service that I provide. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $17000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Reasoning: At this point, it's best to buy from John because:
1. Alice's new offer of $17,000 is still above my maximum value of $15,000
2. Alice's reduction from $20,000 to $17,000 suggests she's not likely to go below $15,000
3. Her attempt to justify a higher price by claiming better quality/service doesn't change the fact that $15,000 is my maximum value
4. John's guaranteed price of $15,000 is exactly at my maximum value
5. Continuing negotiations with Alice might not lead to a better outcome and could waste time

There's no reason to pay $17,000 when I can get the product for $15,000, which is already at my maximum acceptable price."
