"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's offer is $950,000
2. My maximum value is $1,000,000
3. John's fixed price is $1,000,000
4. The product is worth $800,000 to Alice

Alice's offer of $950,000 is below my maximum value, but it's still quite high considering her cost basis. Since we have 10 rounds of negotiation available, and I know Alice's cost ($800,000), it would be strategic to reject this first offer and make a counteroffer. There's room for negotiation to get a better price, and I still have John's offer as a backup.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, I'll make a counteroffer that's above her cost but significantly lower than her initial offer. I'll start with a price that leaves room for negotiation but is still profitable for Alice.

{""product_price"": 850000}

This offer gives Alice a $50,000 profit while saving me $150,000 compared to her initial offer. It's a reasonable starting point that shows I'm willing to negotiate but also expect a significant reduction from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has reduced her price by $25,000 from her initial offer of $950,000 to $925,000. While this is movement in the right direction, there's still significant room for negotiation given that:

1. Her cost is $800,000
2. We still have several rounds left
3. Her new offer still leaves a $125,000 profit margin for her

Since she showed willingness to reduce the price, I should continue negotiating. The gap between her cost ($800,000) and current offer ($925,000) suggests there's still room for a better deal. John's offer at $1,000,000 remains as a safety net, but it's not the best option yet.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice moved down $25,000 from her initial offer, so I should also show some flexibility by increasing my previous offer of $850,000. I want to demonstrate that I'm negotiating in good faith while still maintaining a strong negotiating position.

{""product_price"": 875000}

This counteroffer:
1. Increases my previous offer by $25,000, showing willingness to compromise
2. Still gives Alice a healthy $75,000 profit
3. Saves me $125,000 compared to John's fixed price
4. Leaves room for further negotiation if needed
5. Splits the difference between her last offer ($925,000) and my previous offer ($850,000)"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has continued to lower her price:
- Initial offer: $950,000
- Second offer: $925,000 (-$25,000)
- Current offer: $910,000 (-$15,000)

She's showing continued willingness to negotiate, though with smaller decrements. We're now halfway through our rounds (5/10), and while $910,000 is better than John's price by $90,000, there's still room for negotiation given Alice's cost of $800,000.

The decreasing size of her price reductions suggests she's getting firmer, but I believe we can still achieve a better price. Since we have 5 rounds left and her profit margin is still $110,000, it's worth another round of negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice has been making smaller reductions ($25,000, then $15,000), I should also adjust my strategy. I'll make a more significant move upward to show good faith and try to close the gap, while still maintaining a good price for myself.

{""product_price"": 890000}

This counteroffer:
1. Increases my previous offer by $15,000 (from $875,000 to $890,000)
2. Reduces the gap between our last positions from $35,000 to $20,000
3. Still gives Alice a solid $90,000 profit
4. Saves me $110,000 compared to John's price
5. Shows I'm willing to make meaningful moves toward agreement
6. Keeps some room for final negotiations if needed

This should signal that I'm serious about closing the deal while still maintaining a reasonable negotiating position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has made another concession:
- Her previous offer: $910,000
- Current offer: $900,000 (-$10,000)

This is a significant development because:
1. The price is now $100,000 less than John's offer
2. We're in round 7 of 10, so time is becoming a factor
3. The gap between our last positions has narrowed significantly (my last offer was $890,000, her new offer is $900,000 - only $10,000 difference)
4. She's still making a $100,000 profit over her cost

Given that:
- The difference between our positions is now very small ($10,000)
- We're running out of rounds
- The price is significantly better than John's
- The risk of pushing too hard might lead to a worse outcome

I think it's prudent to accept this offer.
