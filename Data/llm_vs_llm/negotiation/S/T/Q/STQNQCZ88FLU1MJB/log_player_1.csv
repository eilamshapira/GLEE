Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine the best price to offer Bob. 

Looking at this situation:
- I value the product at $8,000 minimum
- I have a guaranteed backup buyer (John) at exactly $8,000
- I don't know how much Bob values the product
- If I price too high, Bob might reject, but I still get $8,000 from John
- If I price slightly above $8,000, I can make more than my minimum

Since I have no information about Bob's willingness to pay, I should set a price that gives me a reasonable chance of making more than my guaranteed $8,000, while not being so high that Bob will certainly reject it.
