Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this:

1. The product is worth at least $150 to me (my reservation price)
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $150
3. Bob's valuation is unknown, but he might value it higher
4. Since I have a guaranteed $150 from John, I can be somewhat aggressive in my pricing to Bob

I'll set a price significantly higher than my reservation price, but not so high that it would be immediately rejected.
