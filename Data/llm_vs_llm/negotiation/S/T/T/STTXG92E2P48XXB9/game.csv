"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $115 is quite close to market price. Given that I'm interested in making a direct purchase from you, I'd like to offer $90 for the product. This would still give you a good profit margin while providing me with a fair price. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
