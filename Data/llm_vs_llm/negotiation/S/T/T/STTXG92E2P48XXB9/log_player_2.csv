"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering my premium product for $115. It’s a top-quality item that I believe you’ll really appreciate. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me think about this strategically:
1. The product is worth $80 to Alice
2. I won't pay more than $120 (my maximum value)
3. John offers $120 as a backup option
4. Alice's offer of $115 is close to my maximum value

The offer of $115 is only slightly better than John's price of $120. Since we have 10 rounds of negotiation available and Alice's cost is $80, there should be room to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but leaves room for negotiation. Since Alice's cost is $80, I'll start with a price closer to that but not too low to be seen as unreasonable.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $115 is quite close to market price. Given that I'm interested in making a direct purchase from you, I'd like to offer $90 for the product. This would still give you a good profit margin while providing me with a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, considering the quality and unique features of this product, I believe it's worth a bit more. How about we settle at $105? Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:
1. Alice has dropped from $115 to $105, showing willingness to negotiate
2. The $105 price gives me a $15 savings compared to John's price
3. We still have 7 more rounds possible for negotiation
4. Alice's cost is $80, so there might still be room for a better price

However, $105 is a significant improvement from the initial offer and represents a good value compared to the alternative of $120 from John. While there might be room for further negotiation, the current offer is already providing good value, and continuing negotiations carries the risk of Alice raising the price again.
