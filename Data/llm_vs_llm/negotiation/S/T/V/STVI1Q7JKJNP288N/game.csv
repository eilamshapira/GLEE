"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $15000 is beyond my budget. I can offer $5000 for the product. Let me know if we can work something out.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5000 is far too low for me. How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $10000. This is a significant discount, and it gives you a great value for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down, Alice. I appreciate the gesture. However, my budget is a bit tight. I can stretch to $6500. Would that be acceptable for you?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $6500 is still too far below what I'm willing to accept.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $8000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
