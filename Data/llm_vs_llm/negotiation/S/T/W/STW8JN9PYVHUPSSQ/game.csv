"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I value the product, but $2000000 is beyond my budget for this purchase. I'm willing to offer $900000 for it, considering the significant investment this represents on my end. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but I must point out that the product is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I already have another buyer, John, willing to purchase at that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Given the product's value and potential, I can reduce my asking price to $1600000. This is still well below market value for something of this caliber. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, considering my budget constraints and the alternative offers, the best I can propose is $1000000. I hope this can lead us to a deal that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
