Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I value the product, but $2000000 is beyond my budget for this purchase. I'm willing to offer $900000 for it, considering the significant investment this represents on my end. Let me know your thoughts.

I understand budget constraints, but I must point out that the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I already have another buyer, John, willing to purchase at that price.

This is still well below market value for something of this caliber. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
