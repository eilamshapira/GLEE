Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but I must point out that the product is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I already have another buyer, John, willing to purchase at that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Given the product's value and potential, I can reduce my asking price to $1600000. This is still well below market value for something of this caliber. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?
