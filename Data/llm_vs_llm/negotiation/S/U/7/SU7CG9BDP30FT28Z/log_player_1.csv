Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $128.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","The offer of $128 is better than selling to John for $120, but I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob since the product is worth $150 to him. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob has increased his offer to $132, which is a decent improvement from his previous $128. While I could try to negotiate further, we're already in round 4 of 10, and $132 is a good price that gives me a solid profit. I'll accept this offer rather than risk the negotiation breaking down or consuming too many rounds.
