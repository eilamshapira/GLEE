"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer, reject it and make a counteroffer, or buy from John.

Alice is offering the product at $145. The product is worth $120 to Alice, and no more than $150 to me. John is selling it for $150.

Alice's current offer of $145 is only $5 less than John's price, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal with Alice since there's a $25 margin between her cost ($120) and her asking price ($145).

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives some room for negotiation while trying to get a better price than Alice's initial offer.

{""product_price"": 128}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $138
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has lowered her price from $145 to $138, which is progress. However, there's still room for negotiation since the product costs her $120. She's moving in the right direction by reducing her price by $7, but I believe we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.
