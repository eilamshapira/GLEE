"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget considerations, $85 is a bit too low for me. I believe the product offers excellent value, and I can come down to $95. This is still a fair price considering what you'll get from it. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $95 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle on $90? I think that's a fair compromise.",90.0,Bob,4,
