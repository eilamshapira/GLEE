"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is quite high for me. I can get the same product from another seller for $80. I'd like to offer you $60 for the product, which I think is a fair price.",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $60 is too low for me. I'm willing to lower my price to $120. This is a fair price considering the quality of the product. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
