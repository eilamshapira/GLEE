Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is quite high for me. I can get the same product from another seller for $80. I'd like to offer you $60 for the product, which I think is a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
