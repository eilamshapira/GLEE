Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2500000}

I'm offering a price of $2.5 million, which provides a significant margin above my minimum acceptable price of $1.2 million. This price allows room for potential negotiation while still ensuring a good profit. If Bob rejects this offer, I know I can still sell to John at $1.2 million, so this is a strategic initial offer that aims to maximize my potential earnings."
