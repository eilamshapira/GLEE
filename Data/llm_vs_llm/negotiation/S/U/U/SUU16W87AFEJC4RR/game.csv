"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let me know if this works for you.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $900000 shows we're moving in the right direction, it's still below what I believe is fair value for this product. Given its quality and features, I can offer it at $1050000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. This represents excellent value for what you're getting.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950000. This is the highest I can go while still considering the value I get from the product. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",950000.0,Bob,4,
