"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,200,000. This is a competitive price for the unique benefits this product offers."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Given that Bob is willing to pay $900,000, which is already $100,000 above my minimum acceptable price, there's room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer that's lower than my initial price but still higher than Bob's current offer, as he seems interested in making a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $900,000 shows we're moving in the right direction, it's still below what I believe is fair value for this product. Given its quality and features, I can offer it at $1,050,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. This represents excellent value for what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950000. This is the highest I can go while still considering the value I get from the product. Let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $950,000. This is a good deal as it's $150,000 more than John's guaranteed offer of $800,000. Bob has increased his offer twice, and his message suggests this is his maximum. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely, and the incremental gain from further negotiation likely isn't worth the risk of having to fall back to John's lower offer."
