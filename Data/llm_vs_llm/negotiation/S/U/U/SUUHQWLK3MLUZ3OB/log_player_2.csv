"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its exceptional worth to you, I'm willing to sell it for a price that reflects its value. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's better to reject Alice's offer. While it's slightly cheaper than John's price, it's still too close to your maximum budget. You can get the product for a better price from John by rejecting Alice's offer."
