"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it to you for $180. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me
2. Alice's offer is $180, which is significantly above my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $100, which matches my maximum value

The rational decision is to reject Alice's very high offer and buy from John instead. Even if I made a counteroffer, Alice's initial price is so far above my maximum value ($180 vs $100) that it's unlikely we'll reach an agreement at a price better than John's offer.
