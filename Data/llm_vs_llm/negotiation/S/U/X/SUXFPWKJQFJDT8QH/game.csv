"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the special price, I've done some research on this product and I believe $11500 is still on the higher side. I'm prepared to purchase it today for $10600. This gives you a good profit margin while allowing me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",10600.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, the product's value to us is higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $11200, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",11200.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer

"Thank you for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that you've moved in the right direction. However, I'm still finding it a bit high for my budget. I can go up to $10800. This gives you an $800 profit on your cost and saves me some money compared to other options. I'm ready to complete the purchase right now at this price. Can we make this work?",10800.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but I need to maintain a certain profit margin. I can meet you halfway at $10900. This is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you.",10900.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
