I'll reject this initial offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the special price, I've done some research on this product and I believe $11,500 is still on the higher side. I'm prepared to purchase it today for $10,600. This gives you a good profit margin while allowing me to stay within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10600}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given the value of the product, I can lower the price to $11000. This is the best I can do while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin. What are your thoughts on this offer?

This is already $1,000 less than John's price, but I still have room to negotiate since I know the product is worth $10,000 to Alice. I'll continue negotiating to try to get a better price.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that you've moved in the right direction. However, I'm still finding it a bit high for my budget. I can go up to $10,800. This gives you an $800 profit on your cost and saves me some money compared to other options. I'm ready to complete the purchase right now at this price. Can we make this work?"", ""product_price"": 10800}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given the value of the product and my need to maintain a certain profit margin, I can offer it to you for $10900. This is my final offer before I consider other options. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has come down to $10,900, which is only $100 more than my last offer. This is a good deal - it's $1,100 less than John's price and only $900 above Alice's cost. While I could try to negotiate further, the difference is small now, and Alice mentioned this is her ""final offer."" I'll accept this reasonable price.
