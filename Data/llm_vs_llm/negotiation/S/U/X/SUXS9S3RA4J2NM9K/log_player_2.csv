"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for $8,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $18,000, which is significantly higher than the product's value to me. I'll reject Alice's offer and propose a counteroffer in the next round.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has only reduced her price from $18,000 to $16,000, which is still double the value of the product to me and double what John is willing to sell it for. Since Alice's price is still significantly higher than my alternative option, I'll reject her offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

While Alice is gradually reducing her price, at this rate, we may not reach an acceptable price within the remaining rounds. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

At this point, I should consider the guaranteed option from John.
