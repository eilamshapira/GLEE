"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering the product for $15,000
3. John is offering the same product for $12,000
4. If I buy from Alice at $15,000, I would be paying $3,000 more than my maximum value
5. If I buy from John at $12,000, I would be paying exactly my maximum value

Since Alice's offer ($15,000) is higher than both:
- My maximum value ($12,000)
- John's alternative offer ($12,000)

The logical choice is to buy from John.
