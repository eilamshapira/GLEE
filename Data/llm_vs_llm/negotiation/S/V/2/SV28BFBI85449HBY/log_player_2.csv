Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer is $1,200,000, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower, but still shows that I'm interested in the product. I'll offer $600,000, which is below my maximum budget of $800,000.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 600000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the market, the value of this product, with its unique features and potential ROI, is considerably higher. I could consider a price of $1000000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's on offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has come down from $1,200,000 to $1,000,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between my previous offer of $600,000 and her current offer of $1,000,000. I'll offer $700,000, which is still below my maximum budget of $800,000, but shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and lower the price to $1,000,000. However, I still believe that's a bit steep for my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $700,000. This price reflects my serious interest in the product while also being mindful of my financial constraints. Let me know if this is something you'd be open to discussing further."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. It seems we're getting closer.  To be completely transparent, I have a hard minimum I need to reach for this. How about we meet in the middle at $850000? This reflects my absolute bottom line while hopefully working within your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $850,000 is very close to my maximum budget of $800,000, and she's mentioned that it's her ""absolute bottom line"", I don't think I can negotiate a better price. However, buying from Alice at $850,000 would exceed my budget, whereas buying from John would be within my budget.
