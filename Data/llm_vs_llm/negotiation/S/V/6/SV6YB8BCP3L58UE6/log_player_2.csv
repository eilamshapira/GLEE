"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $10500. This is a fair price that provides value for both of us. Would you like to proceed with the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is less than your $12,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation. Alice is starting high. You can likely get a better price by rejecting this offer and seeing if she's willing to come down."
