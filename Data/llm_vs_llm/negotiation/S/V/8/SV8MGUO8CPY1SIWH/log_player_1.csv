Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must point out that your asking price of $1750000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, which is exactly what John is offering. To make it worthwhile for me to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product. This gives you a better deal than simply keeping the product (which is worth $1500000 to you), as you would still make a profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Given the significant difference between your offer and the product's worth to me, I'm willing to make a compromise but not to the extent of $850,000. I'm offering the product to you for $1,600,000, which is still above your budget but closer to a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're considering the value of the product to you, which is fair. However, I need to be practical about this negotiation. John is offering me the exact same product for $1000000, which aligns perfectly with my valuation. For me to continue negotiating with you instead of simply accepting John's offer, I would need a price that provides me some advantage. I'm willing to offer $950000, which is slightly below John's price but still represents a $550000 profit for you compared to the product's $1500000 value to you. If we can't find a price point that's attractive for both of us, I'll need to accept John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

My next offer will be: 
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your transparency about John's offer and your willingness to continue negotiating with me. However, I must emphasize that selling the product to you for $950,000 would mean I'm giving up a significant amount of its value. Considering the product's worth to me, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $1,450,000, which is closer to your target price but still reflects the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1450000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating, but I think we need to be realistic about our situation. You know the product is worth $1500000 to you, and I know it's worth no more than $1000000 to me. I also have John's firm offer of $1000000. For me to continue this negotiation rather than simply accepting John's offer, I need a price that's better than what John is offering. My maximum offer is $975000, which still gives you a $525000 profit compared to keeping the product. If you can't accept a price at or below my maximum valuation of $1000000, then it makes no economic sense for me to continue, and I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Given that Bob's maximum offer is $975,000 and he has a firm offer from John for $1,000,000, it's clear that Bob is not willing to meet me at a price that I'm comfortable with. Since I have the option to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, which is the product's value to me, I will choose to end the negotiation with Bob and sell the product to John. This ensures that I get the maximum value for the product."
