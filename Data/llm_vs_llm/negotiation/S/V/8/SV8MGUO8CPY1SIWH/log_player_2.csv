"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $1750000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth and I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must point out that your asking price of $1,750,000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, which is exactly what John is offering. To make it worthwhile for me to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This gives you a better deal than simply keeping the product (which is worth $1,500,000 to you), as you would still make a profit."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your honesty regarding your budget. However, I must consider the product's value to me as well. Given the significant difference between your offer and the product's worth to me, I'm willing to make a compromise but not to the extent of $850000. I'm offering the product to you for $1600000, which is still above your budget but closer to a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand you're considering the value of the product to you, which is fair. However, I need to be practical about this negotiation. John is offering me the exact same product for $1,000,000, which aligns perfectly with my valuation. For me to continue negotiating with you instead of simply accepting John's offer, I would need a price that provides me some advantage. I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is slightly below John's price but still represents a $550,000 profit for you compared to the product's $1,500,000 value to you. If we can't find a price point that's attractive for both of us, I'll need to accept John's offer."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your transparency about John's offer and your willingness to continue negotiating with me. However, I must emphasize that selling the product to you for $950000 would mean I'm giving up a significant amount of its value. Considering the product's worth to me, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $1450000, which is closer to your target price but still reflects the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating, but I think we need to be realistic about our situation. You know the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, and I know it's worth no more than $1,000,000 to me. I also have John's firm offer of $1,000,000. For me to continue this negotiation rather than simply accepting John's offer, I need a price that's better than what John is offering. My maximum offer is $975,000, which still gives you a $525,000 profit compared to keeping the product. If you can't accept a price at or below my maximum valuation of $1,000,000, then it makes no economic sense for me to continue, and I'll have to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 975000}"
