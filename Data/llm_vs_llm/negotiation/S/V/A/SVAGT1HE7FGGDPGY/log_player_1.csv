Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

{""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer ($10,000) is below my minimum acceptable value ($15,000) and even below John's guaranteed offer ($15,000), I will reject this offer and make a counteroffer. There's no reason to accept an offer that's lower than my guaranteed alternative.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll proceed with a new counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still keep it well above my minimum acceptable value to maintain room for negotiation while ensuring profitability.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer ($12,000) is still below John's guaranteed offer ($15,000), it wouldn't be rational to accept it. Given that Bob's counteroffers are still significantly below my minimum acceptable value, and we've already gone through multiple rounds with limited progress, it's becoming more efficient to take the guaranteed offer from John.
