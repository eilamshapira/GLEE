"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $900000, it's still below what I'm looking for given the value of this product. I can come down to $1100000, which I believe is a fair price considering the quality and potential return on investment this product offers. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I understand the value you see in the product, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $950000? I think this is a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your increased offer of $950000. We're getting closer, but I'm still not quite there yet. I can reduce my price to $1050000, which I believe represents excellent value for this product. This is significantly below my initial offer and reflects my genuine interest in working with you. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Thanks for your latest offer, Alice. I'm glad we're getting closer. To meet you halfway, I can go up to $1000000. This is the maximum I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
