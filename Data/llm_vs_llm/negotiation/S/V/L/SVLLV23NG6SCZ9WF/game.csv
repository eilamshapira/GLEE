,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is significantly below its value. I could consider letting it go for $19000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer, reflecting my willingness to work with you.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the reduction, Alice. However, $19000 is still a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'd like to propose $12000 for the product.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate you moving closer to my asking price, $12000 is still less than I'd like to get for this product.  I'd be willing to accept $17000.  This offer represents a significant compromise on my part.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but $17000 is still above my budget. Considering your willingness to compromise, I'd like to propose a price of $14500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair offer.",14500.0,Bob,6,
