"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I was thinking that $8200 would be a more suitable price for me given my budget. Let me know what you think.",8200.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. While I understand budget considerations, I need to account for the true value of this product. I can come down from my initial price, but $8200 is too close to my minimum threshold. I can offer it to you for $9000, which represents a significant discount from my original price while still reflecting the product's value. How does that sound?",9000.0,Alice,3,
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your revised offer. However, considering my budget and market alternatives, I feel that $8500 is a more balanced price. Looking forward to your thoughts.",8500.0,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. While I appreciate your offer at $9000, my budget constraints still keep me leaning towards a lower price. Could we meet in the middle at $8600? Looking forward to your thoughts.",8600.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your increased offer. I can see we're making progress toward finding a price that works for both of us. I can come down to $8800, which I believe is a fair compromise between your budget constraints and the true value of the product. This represents a substantial discount from my initial offer and is much closer to your desired price point. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,5,
