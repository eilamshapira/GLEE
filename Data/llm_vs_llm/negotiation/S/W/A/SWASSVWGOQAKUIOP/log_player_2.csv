"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this excellent product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for a competitive price. If you're interested, please let me know and we can finalize the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I should analyze this situation carefully. 

Alice is offering the product for $120, while John is willing to sell the same product for $100. I'm looking for a product that's worth no more than $100 to me.

Since:
1. Alice's price ($120) is higher than my maximum valuation ($100)
2. Alice's price ($120) is higher than John's price ($100)
3. I want to save as much money as possible

The logical choice is to buy from John at the lower price that matches my maximum valuation.
