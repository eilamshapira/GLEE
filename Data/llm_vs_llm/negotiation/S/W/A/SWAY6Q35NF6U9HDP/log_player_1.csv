Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a reasonably high price to leave room for negotiation while still trying to maximize my profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and even below John's guaranteed offer of $150, I'll reject this offer. However, rather than immediately selling to John, I'll try one more counteroffer with Bob as there might be room for negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from the initial $250, but still keep it well above my minimum of $150 to maintain room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's second offer of $100 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Since Bob's offers have only increased by small amounts ($80 to $100) and remain significantly below John's guaranteed offer of $150, it seems unlikely that Bob will reach an acceptable price point. At this point, it's best to take the guaranteed $150 from John.
