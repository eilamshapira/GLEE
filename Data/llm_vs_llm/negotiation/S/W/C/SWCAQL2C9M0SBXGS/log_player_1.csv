Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering.  $250 seems a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Okay, Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $100. Therefore, I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""I'm sorry, Bob, but I can't accept $100. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle though, and offer it to you for $200."" , ""product_price"": 200}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for considering. How about $200? It's a great deal for such a high-quality product."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate that Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $150? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","This is a tough decision! Bob's final offer is $150. I could try to push for more, but there's a chance I'll lose the sale, and then I'll be stuck with only being able to sell to John for $150. Since my minimum is $150 and Bob is offering $150, I will accept his offer.
