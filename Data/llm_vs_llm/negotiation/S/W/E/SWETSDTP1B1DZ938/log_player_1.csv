Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 16000}

I'm offering a price above Bob's valuation because I know I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $15,000. Since Bob values the product at $12,000, he will likely reject my offer of $16,000, which is fine because I can then sell to John for $15,000. There's no incentive for me to offer a lower price to Bob since I already have a better guaranteed option with John."
