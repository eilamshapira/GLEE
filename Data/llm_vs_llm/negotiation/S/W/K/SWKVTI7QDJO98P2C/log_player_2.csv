"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have an exceptional product available. I can offer it to you for $2000000. This is a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a match for someone with discerning taste. Please let me know if youâ€™d like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to consider this offer carefully.

Alice is offering the product for $2,000,000, but it's only worth up to $1,200,000 to me. If I accept Alice's offer, I would be paying $800,000 more than what the product is worth to me.

John is willing to sell me the same product for $1,200,000, which matches the maximum value I place on it.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and John's price is significantly lower than Alice's offer, the best decision is to buy from John.
