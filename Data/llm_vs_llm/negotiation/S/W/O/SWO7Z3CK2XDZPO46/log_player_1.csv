Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25000 is far too high for my budget. I have other options available at much lower prices. I would be willing to pay $10000 for the product. This is a fair offer considering market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your perspective on the pricing. Given your interest and our ongoing discussion, I'm willing to further adjust my offer to $18,000.
