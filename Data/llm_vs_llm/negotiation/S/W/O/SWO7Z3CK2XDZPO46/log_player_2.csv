"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $25000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
Rationale: Alice's offer of $25,000 is more than twice the amount I'm willing to pay ($12,000) and also significantly higher than John's guaranteed price ($12,000). It's best to reject this initial high offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations don't progress favorably, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25,000 is far too high for my budget. I have other options available at much lower prices. I would be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair offer considering market conditions."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your perspective on the pricing. Given your interest and our ongoing discussion, I'm willing to further adjust my offer to $18000. This price reflects a significant discount while still recognizing the product's value. What are your thoughts on this? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
Rationale: Alice's new offer of $18,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's guaranteed price ($12,000). While Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing the price from $25,000 to $18,000, the gap is still too large. Given that John offers the product at $12,000, which is exactly my maximum value, it's most rational to end the negotiation with Alice and buy from John rather than continue negotiations that may not reach a better price."
