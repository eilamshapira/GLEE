"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $2000000. This is a rare chance to own something truly special.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be transparent that your asking price of $2000000 is significantly above my budget and the market value I've researched. I have another seller, John, offering the same product for $1000000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product, which I believe is fair given my research and budget constraints.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've researched the market extensively, and I believe this product's unique features and potential command a premium price. While John's offer is tempting, I'm confident that partnering with me will be more beneficial in the long run.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'm willing to lower my price to $1600000.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in your offer, but $1600000 is still substantially above what makes economic sense for me. The product is worth no more than $1000000 to my business, which happens to be exactly what John is asking. I value building a relationship with you, but I need a deal that works for my bottom line. I can increase my offer to $900000, which gives you a better price than my initial offer. If we can't reach an agreement closer to this range, I'll unfortunately need to proceed with John's offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I believe you're undervaluing the long-term benefits this product offers. It's not just about the immediate value but the potential it unlocks for your business. I'm willing to consider a price of $1300000. This is a significant concession on my part and demonstrates my commitment to forging a successful partnership.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation and the reduction in your price. However, I need to be completely transparent that this product has a maximum value of $1000000 to my business - this is based on careful analysis of the ROI and benefits it will provide. While I understand you believe in its long-term potential, I have to make decisions based on concrete business metrics. I'm willing to offer you $950000, which is very close to my maximum valuation and what John is asking. This represents my best offer, as going any higher would not make financial sense for my company.",950000.0,Bob,6,
