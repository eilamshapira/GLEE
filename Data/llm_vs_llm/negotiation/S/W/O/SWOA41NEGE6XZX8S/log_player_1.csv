"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be transparent that your asking price of $2000000 is significantly above my budget and the market value I've researched. I have another seller, John, offering the same product for $1000000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product, which I believe is fair given my research and budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've researched the market extensively, and I believe this product's unique features and potential command a premium price. While John's offer is tempting, I'm confident that partnering with me will be more beneficial in the long run.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

I'm strategically choosing a price significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a high return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in your offer, but $1600000 is still substantially above what makes economic sense for me. The product is worth no more than $1000000 to my business, which happens to be exactly what John is asking. I value building a relationship with you, but I need a deal that works for my bottom line. I can increase my offer to $900000, which gives you a better price than my initial offer. If we can't reach an agreement closer to this range, I'll unfortunately need to proceed with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to anchor the price around John's offer, but his willingness to negotiate upwards means there's still room to bargain. I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I believe you're undervaluing the long-term benefits this product offers. It's not just about the immediate value but the potential it unlocks for your business. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,300,000. This is a significant concession on my part and demonstrates my commitment to forging a successful partnership."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

I'm coming down in smaller increments now to signal that I'm reaching my lower limit. Highlighting the long-term benefits is a tactic to shift his focus from the immediate price comparison with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation and the reduction in your price. However, I need to be completely transparent that this product has a maximum value of $1000000 to my business - this is based on careful analysis of the ROI and benefits it will provide. While I understand you believe in its long-term potential, I have to make decisions based on concrete business metrics. I'm willing to offer you $950000, which is very close to my maximum valuation and what John is asking. This represents my best offer, as going any higher would not make financial sense for my company. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has made it clear that he won't go above $1,000,000. While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely I can bridge the gap to a price that's significantly better than John's offer.  Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to accept John's guaranteed $1,200,000 at this point."
