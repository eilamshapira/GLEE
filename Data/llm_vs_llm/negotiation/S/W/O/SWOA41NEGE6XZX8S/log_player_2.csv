"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $2000000. This is a rare chance to own something truly special. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Based on the information provided, Alice is offering the product for $2,000,000, which exceeds the maximum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me. Additionally, I have the option to purchase the same product from John for $1,000,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since Alice's offer is significantly higher than both my valuation and John's alternative price, the most rational decision is to reject Alice's offer.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be transparent that your asking price of $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget and the market value I've researched. I have another seller, John, offering the same product for $1,000,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product, which I believe is fair given my research and budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've researched the market extensively, and I believe this product's unique features and potential command a premium price. While John's offer is tempting, I'm confident that partnering with me will be more beneficial in the long run.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'm willing to lower my price to $1600000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,600,000 is still substantially higher than the maximum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me, and it's also higher than John's price of $1,000,000. Since I can obtain the same product from John at a price that aligns with my maximum valuation, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in your offer, but $1,600,000 is still substantially above what makes economic sense for me. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to my business, which happens to be exactly what John is asking. I value building a relationship with you, but I need a deal that works for my bottom line. I can increase my offer to $900,000, which gives you a better price than my initial offer. If we can't reach an agreement closer to this range, I'll unfortunately need to proceed with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I believe you're undervaluing the long-term benefits this product offers. It's not just about the immediate value but the potential it unlocks for your business. I'm willing to consider a price of $1300000. This is a significant concession on my part and demonstrates my commitment to forging a successful partnership. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has reduced her offer to $1,300,000, which is still above the maximum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me and above John's price. While Alice continues to emphasize potential long-term benefits, I need to make a decision based on the actual value to my business.

Since I can buy the same product from John for $1,000,000, which matches my maximum valuation, I'll reject Alice's current offer.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation and the reduction in your price. However, I need to be completely transparent that this product has a maximum value of $1,000,000 to my business - this is based on careful analysis of the ROI and benefits it will provide. While I understand you believe in its long-term potential, I have to make decisions based on concrete business metrics. I'm willing to offer you $950,000, which is very close to my maximum valuation and what John is asking. This represents my best offer, as going any higher would not make financial sense for my company."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
