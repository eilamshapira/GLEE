"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $200 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $100, and also higher than John's offering price. It would be better to reject and make a counteroffer, as there's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. If we can't reach a reasonable agreement, I can always buy from John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 50}

I'm offering $50, which is significantly lower than my maximum value of $100 and John's price. This gives room for negotiation while potentially allowing me to save money. If Alice rejects this and counters with a price still above $100, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $175 is still well above both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). While she has reduced the price from her initial offer, it's still not acceptable. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, as there's still room for negotiation. If we can't reach a reasonable price, I can still buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 75}

I'm increasing my offer to $75, showing some willingness to negotiate while still staying well below my maximum value of $100. This gives Alice room to counter while keeping the price below John's offer. If Alice doesn't come down to a reasonable price, I still have the option to buy from John at $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Alice's offers have remained consistently above both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). While Alice has shown some movement in price (from $200 to $175 to $160), the rate of decrease suggests we're unlikely to reach a price below $100 in the remaining rounds. It's more rational to take John's guaranteed offer of $100 rather than continue negotiations that may not reach an acceptable price."
