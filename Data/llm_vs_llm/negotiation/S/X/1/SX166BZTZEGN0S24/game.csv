"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. Given my current budget constraints, I'm prepared to offer $800000 for the product. Please let me know if this works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $800000 is significantly below the product's actual value. I understand budget constraints, but I need to emphasize that my absolute minimum is $1500000, as I have another buyer willing to pay that amount. However, I value establishing a business relationship with you, so I can reduce my initial asking price to $1950000. This represents a substantial discount from my original offer while still reflecting the product's true market value.",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, my budget is strictly capped at $1200000, and I really have to make every dollar count. Considering the alternatives and my financial limits, I'd be willing to pay $1100000 for the product. I hope we can find common ground at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but I must be transparent - I have a standing offer of $1500000 from another buyer. While I'd prefer to work with you, I simply cannot accept less than my alternative option. My final offer is $1600000, which is still significantly below my initial asking price. This represents the absolute minimum I can accept while still making this deal worthwhile compared to my alternative. If your budget truly cannot stretch beyond $1200000, I understand, but unfortunately I would need to pursue the other opportunity.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
