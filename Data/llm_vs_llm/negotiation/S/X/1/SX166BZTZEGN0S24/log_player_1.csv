Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $800,000 is significantly below the product's actual value. I understand budget constraints, but I need to emphasize that my absolute minimum is $1,500,000, as I have another buyer willing to pay that amount. However, I value establishing a business relationship with you, so I can reduce my initial asking price to $1,950,000. This represents a substantial discount from my original offer while still reflecting the product's true market value."", ""product_price"": 1950000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Considering the alternatives and my financial limits, I'd be willing to pay $1100000 for the product. I hope we can find common ground at this price.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but I must be transparent - I have a standing offer of $1,500,000 from another buyer. While I'd prefer to work with you, I simply cannot accept less than my alternative option. My final offer is $1,600,000, which is still significantly below my initial asking price. This represents the absolute minimum I can accept while still making this deal worthwhile compared to my alternative. If your budget truly cannot stretch beyond $1,200,000, I understand, but unfortunately I would need to pursue the other opportunity."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
