Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $800000 is significantly below the product's actual value. I understand budget constraints, but I need to emphasize that my absolute minimum is $1500000, as I have another buyer willing to pay that amount. However, I value establishing a business relationship with you, so I can reduce my initial asking price to $1950000. This represents a substantial discount from my original offer while still reflecting the product's true market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,950,000

Considering the alternatives and my financial limits, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I hope we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but I must be transparent - I have a standing offer of $1500000 from another buyer. While I'd prefer to work with you, I simply cannot accept less than my alternative option. My final offer is $1600000, which is still significantly below my initial asking price. This represents the absolute minimum I can accept while still making this deal worthwhile compared to my alternative. If your budget truly cannot stretch beyond $1200000, I understand, but unfortunately I would need to pursue the other opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.
