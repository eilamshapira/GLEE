"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","In this case, I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $2,400,000 against my alternatives.

The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me.

Alice's offer of $2,400,000 is significantly higher than both:
1. The maximum value the product has to me ($1,000,000)
2. John's alternative price of $1,000,000

Since John is offering the product at exactly what it's worth to me ($1,000,000), and this is much better than Alice's offer, I should buy from John.
