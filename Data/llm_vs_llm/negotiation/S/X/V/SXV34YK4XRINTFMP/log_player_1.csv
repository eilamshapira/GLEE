Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that the product is worth $100 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $100, I should start with a higher price when negotiating with Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down while still maintaining the possibility of making more than my guaranteed $100 from John.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $75 is below my minimum acceptable value of $100, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $100, there's no reason for me to accept Bob's offer. While I could make another counteroffer, it's clear that Bob's initial low offer of $75 suggests he may not be willing to pay above $100. The most rational decision is to take the guaranteed $100 from John.
