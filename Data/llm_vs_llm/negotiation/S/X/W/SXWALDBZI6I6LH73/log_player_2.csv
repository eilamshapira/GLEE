"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to consider my options carefully. Alice is offering the product for $900,000, but it's only worth $800,000 to me at most. John is willing to sell it for $800,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

Alice's initial offer is above my maximum value, so accepting it would be a loss for me. I could try to negotiate with Alice, but there's no guarantee she'll go below $800,000. Since John's offer already matches my maximum acceptable price, the rational choice is to buy from John.
