You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer of $11,500 is lower than John's price of $12,000, but still seems high given that the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than Alice's cost ($10,000) but significantly lower than her initial offer. This gives room for negotiation while still ensuring a reasonable profit for Alice.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has lowered her price from $11,500 to $11,250, showing willingness to negotiate. However, there's still room for a better price since her cost is $10,000. Since her new offer is still significantly lower than John's price ($12,000), I'll reject and try one more time to negotiate.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still try to get a good deal. Since Alice moved down $250 from her initial offer, I'll move up a similar amount from my previous offer to show good faith in the negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her price again to $11,000, which is a significant drop from her initial offer of $11,500. This price gives her a reasonable profit ($1,000) while saving me $1,000 compared to John's price. Given that we've gone through several rounds of negotiation and the price is getting closer to a fair middle ground, I'll accept this offer.
