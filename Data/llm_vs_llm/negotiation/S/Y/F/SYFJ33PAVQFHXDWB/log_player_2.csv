"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Based on the information provided, I should analyze which option gives me the best value.

The product is worth at most $10,000 to me, so I wouldn't want to pay more than that. 

Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which exceeds both my valuation of the product and John's offer.

John is willing to sell me the same product for $10,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since I can get the product at a better price from John, and this price is within my acceptable range, I should choose to buy from John.
