,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I think $120 is a bit too high. Can we settle for a lower price instead? How about $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a fair price for a product of this quality. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand where you're coming from, but $110 is still higher than what I'm looking to spend.  Let's meet halfway between your price of $110 and my price of $60? How about $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95, which is a good compromise for both of us. Let's get this deal done!",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, we're getting closer, $95 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle for $88 instead, and call it a day?",88.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I can't go any lower than $90. It's a fair price considering the quality of the product. Let's finalize this deal.",90.0,Alice,7,
