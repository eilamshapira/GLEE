Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly the same as John's offer ($12,000), and this is also my minimum acceptable price, it would be better to continue negotiating with Bob to try to get a better price. There are still several rounds left for negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round at a lower price than my initial offer, but still significantly above $12,000."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer of $14,000 is better than John's fixed offer of $12,000, and it shows significant movement from his previous offer. While we could continue negotiating, this is a good offer that gives me a $2,000 premium over my alternative option with John. I'll accept this offer.
