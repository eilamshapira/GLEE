"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $25000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $8000 for it.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8000 is too low. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I can't go too low. How about $22000?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $22000 is still outside my budget.  I can go up to $9500, but that's the most I can offer at this time.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand. How about we meet in the middle? I can lower my price to $20000. That's my absolute lowest. Are you able to meet me there?",20000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the concession, but $20000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  My final offer is $10500.  If that doesn't work, I'll need to consider other options.",10500.0,Bob,6,
