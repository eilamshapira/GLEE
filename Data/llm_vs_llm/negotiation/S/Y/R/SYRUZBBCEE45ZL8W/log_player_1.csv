"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. Based on its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $25,000."", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $25000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $8000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Okay, I need to consider my options carefully. $8,000 is below my minimum of $10,000. Rejecting and countering is risky, but potentially rewarding.

I choose to reject Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is too low. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I can't go too low. How about $22,000?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $22000 is still outside my budget.  I can go up to $9500, but that's the most I can offer at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a tough spot. $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm getting closer to the point where I need to consider selling to John. However, I'll try one more counteroffer.

I choose to reject Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, one more try...

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand. How about we meet in the middle? I can lower my price to $20,000. That's my absolute lowest. Are you able to meet me there?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the concession, but $20000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  My final offer is $10500.  If that doesn't work, I'll need to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a key decision point. Bob's offer of $10,500 is above my minimum of $10,000. If I reject now, I risk losing the deal entirely. I could try to squeeze out more, but I might also lose the $10,500 and end up with less. Given the risk, I will accept.
