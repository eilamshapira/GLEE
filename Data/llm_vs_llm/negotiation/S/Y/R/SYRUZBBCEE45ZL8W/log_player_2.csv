"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. Based on its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $25000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is far too high. It's important to signal that we're serious about the purchase but unwilling to pay an unreasonable price. We'll counter with a much lower offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $25,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $8,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8000 is too low. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I can't go too low. How about $22000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice reduced her price, it's still too high. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more reasonable price point.  We need to show Alice we're willing to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $22,000 is still outside my budget.  I can go up to $9,500, but that's the most I can offer at this time."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

We're increasing our offer slightly to show Alice we're willing to negotiate, but we're still holding firm well below her asking price. This approach will hopefully encourage her to lower her expectations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand. How about we meet in the middle? I can lower my price to $20000. That's my absolute lowest. Are you able to meet me there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but her ""final offer"" is still too high.  We'll counter again, but we're getting closer to the point where John's offer might be the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the concession, but $20,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  My final offer is $10,500.  If that doesn't work, I'll need to consider other options."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

We are increasing our offer, but we are also setting a firm limit and signaling that we might walk away if Alice doesn't accept this offer. This strategy aims to nudge Alice towards a final decision."
