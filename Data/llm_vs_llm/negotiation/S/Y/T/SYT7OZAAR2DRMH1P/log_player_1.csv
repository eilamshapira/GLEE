Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine the optimal price to offer Bob for the product.

Given information:
- The product is worth at least $10,000 to me (my reservation value)
- The product is worth $15,000 to Bob
- If Bob rejects, I can sell to John for $10,000 guaranteed

Since Bob values the product at $15,000, he should be willing to accept any price below that amount. However, I want to maximize my profit while still making the deal appealing enough for Bob to accept.

If I offer a price too close to $15,000, Bob might reject it as he wouldn't gain much value. If I set the price too low, I'm leaving money on the table.

A reasonable strategy would be to offer a price that gives Bob some surplus value while maximizing my profit. Something around $13,000-$14,000 would be appropriate.

I'll offer $13,500, which gives Bob a $1,500 surplus and gives me $3,500 more than my alternative option (selling to John).
