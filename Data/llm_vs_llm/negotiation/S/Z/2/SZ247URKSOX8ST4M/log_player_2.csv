"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can potentially get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. This might lead her to propose a lower price, or you can buy it from John for $1,000,000."
