"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

It's not worth buying from Alice at her initial price. It's the same price as John, and you want to save money. So, rejecting her offer and trying to negotiate a lower price is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering Alice $950,000, which is still a good deal for her since it's above her desired price of $1,000,000, while also saving me a significant amount compared to her initial offer and John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer is now $1,100,000, which is still less than John's price and closer to my desired price range. Accepting her offer will save me $100,000 compared to buying from John."
