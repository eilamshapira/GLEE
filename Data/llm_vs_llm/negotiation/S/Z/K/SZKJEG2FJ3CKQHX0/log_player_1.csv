Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. Considering its quality and unique features, I'm offering it to you for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $8,000, which is significantly below my minimum and his own valuation, I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, I can't go down to $8,000. Considering the product's value and what it offers, my absolute lowest I can go is $14,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $14000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. Would you consider selling the product to me for $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer of $11,000 is close to my minimum value of $12,000. I need to weigh my options carefully. I could try to push for a little more, but risk losing the sale entirely. Selling to John guarantees me $12,000.

Considering the risk, I think it's better to secure a sale now.
