"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is far beyond what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my market research and needs, I can offer $600000, which I believe is a fair price. Let me know your thoughts.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $600000 is significantly below the product's true worth. I'm willing to compromise, but $1000000 is the absolute minimum I can accept. This price still offers you a great deal, considering the product's potential. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice. However, $1000000 is still more than I can justify for this product. I can increase my offer to $700000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer and reflects the product's value to me. This represents a fair middle ground between our positions.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $700000 is still too far below the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $900000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This is my final offer before I explore other options. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
