Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is far beyond what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my market research and needs, I can offer $600000, which I believe is a fair price. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice. However, $1000000 is still more than I can justify for this product. I can increase my offer to $700000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer and reflects the product's value to me. This represents a fair middle ground between our positions.
