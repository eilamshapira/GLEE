"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $18000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a competitive rate. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $12,000 to me (my maximum value)
2. Alice is offering it for $18,000
3. John is offering it for $12,000
4. Alice's price is $6,000 higher than my maximum value
5. John's price matches my maximum value

Since Alice's offer ($18,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's alternative offer ($12,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept it. While I could reject and make a counteroffer, there's no guarantee Alice would go below $12,000 given the product is worth $15,000 to her. The safest and most economical option is to buy from John.
