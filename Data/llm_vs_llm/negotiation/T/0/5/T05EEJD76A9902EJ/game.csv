"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $60 for the product. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but $60 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a fair price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $90 is still above what I can afford. How about we settle at $70? This way, we both get a fair deal.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $70 is still a bit too low for me. I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get at least closer to my target price. How about we try $100? It's a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $100 is still beyond my budget. Let's meet at $75. It's a step up from my last offer, and I believe it's a reasonable price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $75. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm going to make a small concession, but I need you to meet me closer to my price. How about $110? It's a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair price for the product. If we can't agree on this, I might need to consider other options.",110.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your need to get closer to your target price, but $110 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $80, which is my maximum budget. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can close the deal at this price.",80.0,Bob,8,
