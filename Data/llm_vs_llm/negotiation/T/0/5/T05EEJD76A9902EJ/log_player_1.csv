Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $60 for the product. What do you think?

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $75. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
