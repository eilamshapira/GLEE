"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you today. Given its exceptional value and features, I'm offering it to you for $150. This is a competitive price for such a quality item.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'll get from the product.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I need to be clear that $60 is significantly below what I can accept for this product. Its actual value to me is no less than $120, which is the standing offer I have from another buyer. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can offer it to you for $130, which is already a reduction from my initial price.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $130 is still above my budget. Considering you mentioned the product's value to you is $120 and you're willing to work with me, I'd like to propose a price of $75. This is the highest I'm comfortable going, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but $75 is still below what I can accept for this product. As I mentioned, the product is worth at least $120 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price. However, I'm still interested in doing business with you. My counteroffer is $125. This is already $5 less than what I could get elsewhere, showing my willingness to work with you.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $125 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. Given that you've already shown flexibility and I'm eager to close the deal, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. I propose a price of $80, which I believe is a fair compromise considering our previous discussions.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you've reached your maximum offer of $80, and I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise. However, I need to be transparent with you - this product is worth no less than $120 to me, and I have John ready to purchase it at that price. Given our multiple rounds of negotiation without finding a middle ground that works for both of us, I think it's best for me to make one final offer of $120. This matches what I would receive from my other buyer, but I'm giving you the priority. If this doesn't work for your budget, I completely understand and will need to move forward with my other option.",120.0,Alice,7,
