"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you our exclusive product at a special price of $1600000. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $1,600,000
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $1,000,000

This is an easy decision:
- Alice's offer ($1,600,000) is much higher than both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000)
- Accepting Alice's offer would mean overpaying by $600,000
- John's offer matches my maximum value and is the better deal
