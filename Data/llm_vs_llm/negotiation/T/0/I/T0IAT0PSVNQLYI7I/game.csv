"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I believe your asking price is a bit high for the market value. I've done my research, and I would like to make a counteroffer of $1300000. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. I look forward to your response.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1700000. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. I can offer you the product for $1600000.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
