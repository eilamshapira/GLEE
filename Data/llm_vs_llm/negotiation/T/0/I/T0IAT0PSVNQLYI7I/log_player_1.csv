Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will be a valuable addition to your collection. After careful consideration, I've set a competitive price for the product. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you."", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I believe your asking price is a bit high for the market value. I've done my research, and I would like to make a counteroffer of $1300000. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is lower than what I'm willing to accept, and I have a better alternative with John, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price. 

My counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,700,000. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. I can offer you the product for $1,600,000."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
