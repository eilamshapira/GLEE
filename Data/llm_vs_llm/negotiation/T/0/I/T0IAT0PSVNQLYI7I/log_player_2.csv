"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will be a valuable addition to your collection. After careful consideration, I've set a competitive price for the product. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer of $1,750,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,500,000) and John's price ($1,500,000), I should reject this offer. I can try to negotiate with Alice for a better price, and if we can't reach an agreement, I always have the option to buy from John at $1,500,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I believe your asking price is a bit high for the market value. I've done my research, and I would like to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. I look forward to your response."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1700000. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. I can offer you the product for $1600000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's new offer of $1,600,000 is still above both my maximum value ($1,500,000) and John's price ($1,500,000), it makes the most economic sense to buy from John. Alice seems unlikely to go below $1,500,000 given her negotiation stance, so continuing to negotiate would likely be futile. John's price is the best guaranteed option available."
