"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given the situation, I'll analyze my options:

1. Alice is offering the product for $100, which is already less than my maximum value ($120)
2. I could try to negotiate an even lower price by making a counteroffer
3. I could buy from John for $120, but this is clearly worse than Alice's current offer

Since $100 is already a reasonable price (below my maximum valuation), and there's some risk in negotiation (Alice might walk away or increase her price), I'll accept this offer.
