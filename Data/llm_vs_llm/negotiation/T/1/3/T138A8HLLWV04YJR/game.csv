"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $1800000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1200000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let me know if this works for you.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget considerations, $1200000 is the minimum value of this product to me, and I have another buyer (John) ready to pay that amount. Given the product's exceptional quality and market value, I can come down to $1600000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price reflects the true value of what you're getting.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1600000 is still above what I'm willing to spend. I can go up to $1300000, which I believe is a fair price considering the market and my budget constraints. Let me know if you can accept this offer.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
