"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  $180 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $80, that's well below what I can accept. This is a high-quality item with significant value. Given that I have another buyer willing to pay $120, I can offer it to you for $150. This is already a reduction from my initial price. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $150 is still too much for me. I know I can get a similar product for $120 elsewhere.  I could go up to $95, but that's my absolute limit.",95.0,Bob,4,
