Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $80, that's well below what I can accept. This is a high-quality item with significant value. Given that I have another buyer willing to pay $120, I can offer it to you for $150. This is already a reduction from my initial price. What do you think?
