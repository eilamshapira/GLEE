"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $1200000 is at the very top of my budget. Given that I have other options available at similar prices, I would like to propose a more competitive offer of $800000. This represents a substantial amount and would allow for a mutually beneficial transaction. Would you consider this offer?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $800000. I understand budget considerations, but that price matches my minimum acceptable value for this product. Given its quality and potential return on investment, I believe a fair price would be $1100000. This represents a $100000 reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of what you'll be receiving. Would you consider this counteroffer?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. Your product certainly seems valuable, but I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. I can move up to $950000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This represents a fair middle ground between our positions and would allow us to close the deal quickly. Would this work for you?",950000.0,Bob,4,
