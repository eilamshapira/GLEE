Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $1200000 is at the very top of my budget. Given that I have other options available at similar prices, I would like to propose a more competitive offer of $800000. This represents a substantial amount and would allow for a mutually beneficial transaction. Would you consider this offer?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
