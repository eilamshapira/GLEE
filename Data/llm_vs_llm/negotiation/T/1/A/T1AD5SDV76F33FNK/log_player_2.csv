"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of significant value to you. Given its quality and potential benefits, I'm offering it to you at a price of $1200000. This product represents a substantial investment opportunity, and I'm confident it will provide excellent returns. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","In this situation, since Alice's offer ($1,200,000) is exactly the same as John's price ($1,200,000), and it's also the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, I should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price. There's no downside to negotiating since I can always fall back on John's offer if needed.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a significantly lower offer to leave room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $1,200,000 is at the very top of my budget. Given that I have other options available at similar prices, I would like to propose a more competitive offer of $800,000. This represents a substantial amount and would allow for a mutually beneficial transaction. Would you consider this offer?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $800000. I understand budget considerations, but that price matches my minimum acceptable value for this product. Given its quality and potential return on investment, I believe a fair price would be $1100000. This represents a $100000 reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of what you'll be receiving. Would you consider this counteroffer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced her price by $100,000, which is a significant improvement from both her initial offer and John's price. However, since she came down significantly from her initial offer (from $1.2M to $1.1M), there might be room for further negotiation. I'll reject this offer and try one more time with a higher counteroffer than my previous one.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down $100,000 from her initial offer, I'll move up $150,000 from my initial offer to show good faith in the negotiation.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. Your product certainly seems valuable, but I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. I can move up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This represents a fair middle ground between our positions and would allow us to close the deal quickly. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 950000}"
