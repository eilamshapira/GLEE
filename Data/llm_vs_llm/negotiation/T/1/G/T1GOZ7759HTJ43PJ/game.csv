"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit steep for me.  Given my budget and the product's value, I'm willing to pay $7500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $7500 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $9000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8250.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,4,
