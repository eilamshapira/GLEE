Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $80 is exactly the same as John's guaranteed offer and equals my minimum acceptable price, there's no risk in rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer. I might be able to get a better price from Bob.
