"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. However, $5000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me. I understand that $25000 might be beyond your budget, so I'm willing to lower my offer to $20000. This is still considerably more than your offer, but it reflects the product's high quality. Let me know if you can meet this new price.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $20000 is still too high for me. I can go up to $7000, which is a significant increase from my last offer but still within my budget. Let me know if this works for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for coming up a bit. I see that we're still quite far apart on the price. Given your budget, I'm willing to lower my offer further to $17000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my effort to meet you in the middle. Please let me know if this price is acceptable to you.",17000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your effort to lower the price, but $17000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $8000, which is the highest I can go while still staying within my financial limits. Let me know if you can accept this price.",8000.0,Bob,6,
