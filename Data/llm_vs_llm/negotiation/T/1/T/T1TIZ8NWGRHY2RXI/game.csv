,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. Unfortunately, $1000000 doesn't meet the value of this premium product. I'd like to continue our negotiation and propose a higher asking price. Let's discuss further details in the next round.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your position, but this product truly delivers exceptional value. Considering its rarity and the benefits it offers, I'm prepared to meet you closer to your range. How about we set the price at $1750000? I believe this is a fair middle ground given the unique advantages of this asset. Let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle, let's try $1375000. This would allow us to both walk away happy with a fair deal.",1375000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but given the exceptional value this product offers, I must stand firm at $1500000. This price reflects its premium features and long-term benefits. I'm confident you'll see this as a worthwhile investment. Looking forward to your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1500000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1400000, but that's my final offer.  If you're not able to come down to this price, I'll have to look elsewhere.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer. I agree to sell the product at $1400000. Thank you for your business.",,Alice,6,AcceptOffer
