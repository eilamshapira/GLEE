Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. Since the product is worth $100 to me and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $100, I should offer Bob a price higher than $100 to maximize my potential profit. If Bob rejects, I lose nothing since I can still sell to John for $100. I'll set a moderately high price that might still be acceptable to Bob.
