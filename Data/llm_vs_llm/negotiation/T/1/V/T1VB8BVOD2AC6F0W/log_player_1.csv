"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 
I'm going to start high, knowing Bob values the product at $80. This gives us room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$50 is far too low for me. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm dropping the price to $125. This is still a good deal for me, and hopefully, Bob sees it as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $60 is better than $50, I'm still not comfortable selling it for that low.  I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering the price again to $100. This is a significant discount from my initial price, but still above my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've had enough of this back and forth. I'm selling the product to John for $150. While it's not the highest price I was hoping for, it's still a good deal for me, and I can move on to other business."
