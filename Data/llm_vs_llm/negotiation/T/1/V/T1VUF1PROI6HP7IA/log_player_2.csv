"Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer ($160) is higher than both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120), it wouldn't be rational to accept Alice's offer. John's offer is the better option here.
