"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:** Since I know the product is worth less to Bob than to me, I start with the highest possible price. This anchors the negotiation high and leaves me room to negotiate down. It also allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to pay. If he accepts this initial high price, I maximize my profit immediately."
