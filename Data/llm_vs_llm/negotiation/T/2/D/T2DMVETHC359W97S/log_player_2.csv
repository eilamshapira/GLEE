"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer, reject and make a counteroffer, or buy from John.

Alice is offering the product at $120, which is exactly my maximum value for the product and the same price that John is selling it for. Since both options cost the same, there's no advantage to buying from John over Alice.

However, by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer, I might be able to get the product for less than $120, which would save me money. Since my goal is to ""buy some product but save as much money as you can,"" I should try to negotiate with Alice first.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice that's below the $120 maximum I'm willing to pay.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has countered with an offer of $105, which is $15 less than both her original offer and John's price. This is a good improvement from the initial $120 price.

Since the product is worth up to $120 to me, and Alice is now offering it at $105, this is a good deal that saves me money compared to buying from John. I could try to negotiate further, but there's also a risk Alice might increase her price or end negotiations if I push too hard.

Given that I've already saved $15 from the maximum I was willing to pay, I'll accept this offer.
