You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice is offering the product for $200, which is more than the $80 it's worth to me, and I can buy the same product from John for $80, I should choose to buy from John.
