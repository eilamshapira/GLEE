"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I see that Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is $200,000 less than John's price of $1,200,000. Since the product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, and Alice's offer is lower than that maximum value, it would be advantageous for me to accept this offer.
