Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to set a price that maximizes my potential profit while ensuring I don't lose the sale entirely.

Since the product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price, I can afford to be somewhat aggressive with my pricing to Bob. However, if I price it too high, Bob might reject the offer.

Without knowing Bob's valuation, I'll offer a price that gives me a good premium over my minimum acceptable value, while still potentially being attractive to Bob.
