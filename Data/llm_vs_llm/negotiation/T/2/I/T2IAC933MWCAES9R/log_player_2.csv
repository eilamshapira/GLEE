"Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision that maximizes my value.

The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and I have an option to buy it from John for exactly $10,000.

Alice's offer is $22,500, which is significantly higher than both the product's worth to me and John's price.

The logical choice is to buy from John at the lower price.
