# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm sure you'll find our price of $1300000 quite reasonable.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I'll reject Alice's offer of $1,300,000 because:

2. It's even above Alice's own value ($1,200,000)
3. John's offer ($1,000,000) is better
4. There's room for negotiation with Alice

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but still gives room for negotiation:

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. Given market conditions and my research, I would be willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This represents a fair value that could work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, after reevaluating our position, we're willing to meet you halfway. We're now offering the product at $1100000. This price accounts for your budget constraints while also considering our costs and the product's market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

2. John's offer ($1,000,000) is still better
3. We've made progress in negotiation (down from $1,300,000 to $1,100,000), so there might be room for further negotiation
4. If negotiations fail, I can still take John's offer later

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still keep it under John's price:

{""message"": ""Thank you for coming down in price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,100,000 is still above my maximum budget. I can raise my offer to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a fair value for both parties."", ""product_price"": 950000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're trying to find a suitable middle ground. In an effort to move this process forward, I'm willing to lower our price to $1025000. This offer is very close to your stated maximum budget and demonstrates our commitment to reaching an agreement with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

1. Alice's offer ($1,025,000) is still above John's price ($1,000,000)
2. John's offer is guaranteed and available
3. We've had several rounds of negotiation, and Alice is still above John's price
4. The difference between Alice's offer and John's price isn't justified
