"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its value and rarity, I'm setting the initial price at $1200000. Let me know if you're interested!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity, but I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial price point. I've received a competing offer from another seller at exactly $1200000, so there's currently no advantage for me to purchase from you at that price. I'm interested in the product, but would need a better price to move forward with you. Would you consider $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to lower my offer to $1100000 to reflect your interest and the competitive situation. Let me know if this works for you.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and the competitive offer you've mentioned. To show my willingness to work with you, I'm adjusting my price to $1050000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, reflecting my desire to reach an agreement with you. Please let me know if this revised offer is more in line with your expectations.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for moving in the right direction, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your revised offer of $1050000 is better, but I believe we can still find a price that works even better for both of us. The product is worth $950000 to me, which would still give you a solid deal while providing me with the savings I need to justify not going with the alternative option. Would you accept $950000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
"Thank you for your feedback, Bob. I'm glad we're moving closer to an agreement. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $1000000? This price reflects the value of the product and the urgency to finalize our deal.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the progress we're making. To further bridge the gap, I'm proposing a price of $980000. This offer is a significant step towards your last counteroffer while still ensuring the value of the product is recognized. Let me know if this works for you.",980000.0,Alice,5,
