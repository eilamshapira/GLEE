Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity, but I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial price point. I've received a competing offer from another seller at exactly $1200000, so there's currently no advantage for me to purchase from you at that price. I'm interested in the product, but would need a better price to move forward with you. Would you consider $900000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for moving in the right direction, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your revised offer of $1050000 is better, but I believe we can still find a price that works even better for both of us. The product is worth $950000 to me, which would still give you a solid deal while providing me with the savings I need to justify not going with the alternative option. Would you accept $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
