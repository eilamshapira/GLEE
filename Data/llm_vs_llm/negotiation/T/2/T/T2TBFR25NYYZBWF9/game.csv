"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $250 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Based on my research and budget, I can offer $60 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",60.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, $60 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept for this product. I'm willing to lower my price to $200. Let me know if this works for you.",200.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $180. Let me know if this is something you can consider.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $180 is still beyond what I can justify spending. Based on my budget and the market value, I can go up to $70. This is a fair price that works for my budget. Please let me know if you can accept this offer.",70.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is still too low for me to accept. I'm willing to lower the price further to $160, which is a significant discount from my original offer. Let me know if this works for you.",160.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here. I can go down to $155, which is the lowest I can go while still valuing the product appropriately. Let me know if this price works for you.",155.0,Alice,5,
