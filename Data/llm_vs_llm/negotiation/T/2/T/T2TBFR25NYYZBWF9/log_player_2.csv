"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $250. Let me know if you'd like to take it at this price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'll analyze the situation:
1. My maximum value for the product is $80
2. Alice's offer of $250 is way above my maximum value
3. John is offering the product at $80, which is my maximum value
4. Alice's initial offer is more than 3 times higher than my maximum value
5. While I could make a counteroffer, given the huge gap between Alice's price and my maximum value, it might be better to buy from John

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate with Alice once, as her price is too high.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that my maximum value is $80 and Alice's initial offer was very high at $250, I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's below my maximum value to leave room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $250 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Based on my research and budget, I can offer $60 for the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $180. Let me know if this is something you can consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let's analyze:
1. My maximum value is still $80
2. Alice has reduced her price from $250 to $180
3. While this shows willingness to negotiate, $180 is still more than double my maximum value
4. John's offer of $80 remains available and matches my maximum value
5. Even though Alice made a significant reduction, we're still very far from my target price

Given that Alice's new offer of $180 is still well above my maximum value of $80, and her reduction suggests she might still have significant room to negotiate down, I'll reject this offer and try one more time.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down significantly from $250 to $180, showing willingness to negotiate, I'll increase my previous offer but still stay below my maximum value of $80.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $180 is still beyond what I can justify spending. Based on my budget and the market value, I can go up to $70. This is a fair price that works for my budget. Please let me know if you can accept this offer."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here. I can go down to $155, which is the lowest I can go while still valuing the product appropriately. Let me know if this price works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let's analyze the situation:
1. My maximum value remains at $80
2. Alice has reduced her price from $180 to $155
3. The reduction is relatively small (only $25), suggesting she's becoming less flexible
4. She states this is ""the lowest she can go""
5. We're still nearly double my maximum value
6. John's offer of $80 is still available and matches my maximum value
7. After multiple rounds, we're still very far apart in our price expectations

Given that:
- We've had multiple rounds of negotiation
- The gap is still very large ($155 vs my $80 maximum)
- Alice's statement suggests she won't go much lower
- John's offer of $80 is available and within my value range

It's time to end this negotiation and take John's offer.
