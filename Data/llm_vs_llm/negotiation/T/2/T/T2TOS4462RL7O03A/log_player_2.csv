(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Given that Alice is offering the product for $2,000,000, which is more than what the product is worth to me ($1,500,000), and more than Jhon's price ($1,500,000), I should either reject or buy from Jhon.

Since I can make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal from Alice, I'll reject her offer and proceed to the next round.

Since Jhon's price is the same as the maximum value the product is worth to me, I should either try to negotiate further with Alice or go with Jhon's offer.

I'll reject Alice's offer and try another counteroffer, as we still have plenty of rounds left to negotiate.
