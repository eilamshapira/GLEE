Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me make an initial offer to Bob. Since I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to him, I'll start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I get more than my minimum acceptable price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $1,200,000, I will sell to John.
