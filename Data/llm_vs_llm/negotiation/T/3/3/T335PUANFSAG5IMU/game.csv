"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this unique asset. Given its immense value and potential, I'm setting the initial price at $1300000. I believe it's a worthwhile investment that will bring you significant returns.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $1300000 is far beyond my budget. While I appreciate the potential, I can only offer $600000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $600000 is significantly below the true value of this product. While I can't accept that offer, I am willing to come down to $1250000. This is a substantial reduction, and I hope you'll see it as a sign of my willingness to negotiate.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1250000 is still too high. I am willing to offer $700000. This is my best offer at this time.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. While $700000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, I am willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about $1200000? I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll receive.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
