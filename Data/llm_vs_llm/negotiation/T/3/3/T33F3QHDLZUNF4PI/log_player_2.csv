"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $120. It's a great value and I think you'll be very happy with it. Are you interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $150
2. Alice's offer is $120, which is $30 less than John's price
3. While I could try to negotiate for an even lower price, $120 is already a good deal with a $30 saving
4. There's a risk that if I reject and make a counteroffer, Alice might not accept it or might increase her price in subsequent negotiations

Since $120 is already a good price (20% less than my maximum value and John's price), it's reasonable to accept this offer rather than risk losing it.
