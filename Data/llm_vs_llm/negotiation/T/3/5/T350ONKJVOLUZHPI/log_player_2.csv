"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price of $120 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $80, and also higher than John's offer. It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. Even if negotiations with Alice don't work out, I can always buy from John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 60}

I'll propose $60 as my counteroffer. This price is below my maximum value of $80 and John's price, which gives me room to negotiate upward if needed. If Alice rejects this offer, we can potentially meet somewhere in the middle, while still staying below my maximum value of $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has lowered her price from $120 to $95, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but $95 is still above both my maximum value ($80) and John's offer ($80). I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer. Since Alice has shown willingness to move down in price, we might be able to reach a deal below $80. If not, I can still buy from John at $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 70}

I'll increase my previous offer to $70. This is a $10 increase from my last offer of $60, showing I'm willing to negotiate upward. This price is still below both my maximum value and John's price of $80, giving me room to potentially negotiate further if needed. It also demonstrates good faith in the negotiation by making a significant move toward Alice's last offer of $95."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John for $80. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer ($85) is still above John's price ($80)
2. While Alice has been coming down in price ($120 → $95 → $85), she's still not beating John's offer
3. We've already gone through 5 rounds, and there's a risk that we might not reach a better deal than $80
4. $80 is my maximum value for the product anyway

It's most rational to take John's guaranteed offer of $80 rather than continue negotiations that might not result in a better price."
