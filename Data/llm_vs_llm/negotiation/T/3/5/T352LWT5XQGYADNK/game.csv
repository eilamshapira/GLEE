"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 is a bit steep for me.  Given my budget and the market value of similar products, I'd be willing to pay $850000.  This is a fair price that allows for a healthy profit for you and gets me the product I need.  Let's work together to reach a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're working within a budget, but I need to consider the true value of this product. It's high-quality and will provide substantial benefits to your business. I can come down on my price, but $850000 is too close to my bottom line. I can offer it to you for $920000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's value.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm happy to offer $880000.  This price reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",880000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your improved offer. I understand the importance of finding a price that works for both of us. After careful consideration, I can offer the product at $900000. This represents a $50000 reduction from my initial offer and is a fair compromise that recognizes both the product's value to you and my investment in it. This price point allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900000 is still a little outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $890000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal.",890000.0,Bob,6,
