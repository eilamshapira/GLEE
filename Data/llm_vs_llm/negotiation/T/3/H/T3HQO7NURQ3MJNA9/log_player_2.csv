Alice's offer is far above our budget and what we can get from John.  We need to negotiate a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

This is a starting point. It's important to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a price significantly below John's offer."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice lowering her price is a good sign, but $140 is still too high. We are better off continuing the negotiation and seeing if we can get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 75}

We'll increase our offer slightly to show Alice we're willing to move, but we're still a good distance from her current price. This should encourage her to negotiate further."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is coming down, but we're still a fair bit above our ideal price and what John is offering. We need to signal that we're serious about a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 85}

Let's show Alice we're willing to meet her halfway between our last offer and her current one. This keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a more reasonable price."
