,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the opportunity you're presenting, but $2000000 is beyond my budget for this product. I can offer you $750000, considering the other options available to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750000 is far below the product's true value.  I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1750000. This price reflects both my need to ensure a fair return and your desire to acquire this unique opportunity. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your consideration and your willingness to negotiate. However, $1750000 is still above what I'm prepared to spend. I respect the value you're placing, but my budget allows me to propose $900000 for the product. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  while I appreciate your offer, $900000 is still far below the product's worth.  I'm willing to bridge the gap a bit further and offer the product for $1250000. This price reflects the value you'll gain from owning this unique product, and I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me on the price. However, the offer of $1250000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to raise my offer to $1000000, which is the absolute maximum I can justify at this point. I hope this can help us move closer to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget limitations. However, $1000000 doesn't reflect the true value of this exceptional product. I'm willing to come down to $1150000 as a final compromise. This is a price that acknowledges your need for affordability while ensuring I receive a fair return.  I believe this offer is a win-win for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
