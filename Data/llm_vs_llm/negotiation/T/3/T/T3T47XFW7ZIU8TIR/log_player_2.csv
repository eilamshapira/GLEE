"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in!  I'm offering it to you at a special price of $150.  It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll love it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $120 to me
2. Alice is offering the product for $150
3. John is offering the same product for $120
4. If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John

Since Alice's offer ($150) is:
- Higher than what the product is worth to me ($120)
- Higher than John's price ($120)

The logical choice is to buy from John, as it will save me $30 compared to Alice's offer and matches the maximum value I place on the product.
