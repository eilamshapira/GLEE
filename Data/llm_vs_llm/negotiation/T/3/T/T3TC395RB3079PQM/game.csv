"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your interest, $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. This is still a great deal for such a fantastic product! What do you say?",120.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for considering my offer, Alice. I understand $70 was quite low. How about $85? I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. This is my final offer before I move on to other potential buyers.",105.0,Alice,5,
