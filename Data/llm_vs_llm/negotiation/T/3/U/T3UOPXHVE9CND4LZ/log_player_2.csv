"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since you can buy the product for $1,000,000 from John, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at the same price.  You should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or be prepared to buy from John."
