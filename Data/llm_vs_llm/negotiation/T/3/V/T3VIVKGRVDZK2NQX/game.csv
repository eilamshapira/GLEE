"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $9000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $7000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my investment in it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but $8500 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle on $7500? I think that's a fair compromise given the value of the product to both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $7500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8000, which is my absolute bottom line.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to cover my costs.  Let's close this deal, I think we're very close.",8000.0,Alice,5,
