,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $4000 is far below its value. I'm willing to come down, but I can't go that low. How about $16500?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16500 is still quite high for me. I can increase my offer to $5000.",5000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're still quite far apart. Let's try to meet in the middle a bit more. I'm willing to lower the price to $15000. This is a significant reduction and I'm approaching my bottom line. ",15000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm genuinely trying to work with you, but $6000 is simply not feasible. My absolute minimum is $13500. This is a final offer and I won't be able to go any lower.",13500.0,Alice,7,
