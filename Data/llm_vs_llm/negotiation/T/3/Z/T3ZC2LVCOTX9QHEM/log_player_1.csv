"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $65 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $150 and even lower than his own valuation of $80, I will reject his offer.

My counteroffer will be $140, which is closer to my minimum price and gives Bob a chance to reconsider.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's offer of $70 is still lower than his own valuation of $80 and much lower than my minimum price of $150. I will reject his offer again.

My next counteroffer will be $135, which is slightly lower than my previous offer but still closer to my minimum price.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's offer of $75 is still lower than his own valuation of $80 and much lower than my minimum price of $150. I will reject his offer again.

At this point, I'm starting to think that Bob is not willing to meet me at a reasonable price, and I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150. I'm going to consider selling to John instead of continuing to negotiate with Bob.
