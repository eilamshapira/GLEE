"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm very excited to offer you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Considering its unique qualities and potential, I'm willing to let it go for $3000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $3,000,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000), it would not be rational to accept this offer. While I could try to negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, given that her initial offer is three times higher than John's price, it would be most reasonable to simply buy from John.
