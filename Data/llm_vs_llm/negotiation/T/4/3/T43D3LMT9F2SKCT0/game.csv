"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! The product sounds interesting, but $20000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your response, Bob! While I understand your budget, $8000 is significantly lower than what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle? My new offer is $17000. Let me know your thoughts!",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. While I appreciate you coming down on the price, $17000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9000.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but $9000 is still too low for me. How about we settle at $16000? I believe this would be a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Thanks, Alice. I still think $16000 is too high. Given my budget, the highest I can go is $9500. That's my final offer.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your continued interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $9500. How about we settle on $15500? It would be a great opportunity for you, and I think we're close to a deal. Let me know your thoughts!",15500.0,Alice,7,
