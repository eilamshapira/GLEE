"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $700000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700000 is significantly below the product's true value. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $850000. This price reflects a significant discount and presents a great opportunity for you.  Let's make this deal work.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're willing to negotiate, which is great. However, $850000 is still a bit high for me. I can stretch my budget to $750000. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $750000 is still a bit too low, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and settle on $800000? This price is fair to both of us and allows us to close this deal. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Alice,5,
