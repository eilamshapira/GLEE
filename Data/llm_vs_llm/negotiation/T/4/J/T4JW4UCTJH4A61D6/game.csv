"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can be a great asset to you. I'm initially offering it at $25000. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $25000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm looking to spend no more than $6000 on this product. Would you be open to negotiating the price down?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is considerably higher than your offer.  To be frank, $6000 is too low for me to consider. Could you meet me closer to $20000?",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $20000 is still quite high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $8000 to meet you in the middle. How does that sound?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but we're still quite far apart. This product has significant inherent value and I can't let it go for less than $17000. This is a very competitive price for what you're getting. What do you say?",17000.0,Alice,5,
