Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. After careful consideration, I've set a competitive price for it. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for presenting your product. While I appreciate its value, your asking price is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $6000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me, and I know I have a better alternative with John, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $17,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I believe the product's value justifies this price."", ""product_price"": 17000}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for getting back to me. I understand the product's value, but I have a firm budget in mind.  I'm willing to raise my offer to $7000, but that's my limit. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $7,000 is still significantly lower than the product's value to me, and I know I have a better alternative with John, I will reject Bob's offer. However, considering Bob mentioned that $7,000 is his limit, I will not make another counteroffer. Instead, I will choose to sell the product to John for $15,000.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I previously decided to sell to John, but since I'm being asked to make a counteroffer to Bob, I will do so. However, I will make it clear that I'm not willing to go much lower.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your revised offer, but I'm afraid $7,000 is still not enough. Considering your limit, I'm willing to make one final compromise. I can offer the product to you for $14,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
