"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. After careful consideration, I've set a competitive price for it. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is way above my budget and even above her own valuation of the product. It makes more sense to negotiate or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for presenting your product. While I appreciate its value, your asking price is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $6,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

This counter-offer is a starting point in the negotiation. It is significantly lower than Alice's asking price but provides room for negotiation while staying well below my $8,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $17000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I believe the product's value justifies this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice barely budged on her price. It seems unlikely she'll come down to a price I'm willing to pay anytime soon.  I'll try one more counteroffer, but I'm leaning towards John's offer if this doesn't work."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for getting back to me. I understand the product's value, but I have a firm budget in mind.  I'm willing to raise my offer to $7,000, but that's my limit. Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

This counter-offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise but sets a clear boundary at my maximum price. Hopefully, this encourages Alice to engage in more meaningful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your revised offer, but I'm afraid $7000 is still not enough. Considering your limit, I'm willing to make one final compromise. I can offer the product to you for $14000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

```

Alice is not budging enough. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer. While I might have gotten the product for a bit less than $14,000, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Alice. John's offer is within my budget and ensures I get the product."
