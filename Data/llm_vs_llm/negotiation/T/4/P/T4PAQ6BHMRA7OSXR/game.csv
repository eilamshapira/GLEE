"Thank you for your offer, Alice, but $300 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in purchasing the product, though. I can offer $80 for it. Let me know if we can work something out.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $80, I can't go that low as my cost basis is higher than that. I understand $300 might be beyond your budget, so I can offer it to you for $220. This is a quality product that provides excellent value. What do you think?",220.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, Alice. However, $220 is still more than I'm prepared to spend. Considering my budget and your costs, I can raise my offer to $100.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $100 is still below what I can accept for this product. My bottom line is $180, which is already significantly reduced from my initial offer. This price reflects the true value of the product while still providing you with a good deal. Can you meet me at $180?",180.0,Alice,5,
