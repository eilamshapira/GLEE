"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",700000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $700000 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price. I'm countering with $1100000, which still offers you a valuable deal. Please consider this offer carefully.",1100000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value this product brings is significant. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1050000. This is a fair price considering the quality and benefits you'll receive. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1050000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",750000.0,Bob,4,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. However, $750000 is still below our minimum threshold. I'm willing to lower the price to $1025000, which is a significant reduction from our initial offer and reflects my desire to work with you. Please let me know if this works for you.",1025000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. I'm willing to further reduce the price to $1000000. This is the lowest I can go while still maintaining the value of the product for both of us. Please consider this offer seriously.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reduce the price. However, $1000000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $875000. This is a serious and final offer from my side, considering I have another option to buy the product for $800000 from another seller.",875000.0,Bob,6,
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but unfortunately, it's still below our minimum acceptable price. Given the circumstances, I will be selling the product to another buyer, John, for $1000000. Thank you for your interest and I hope we can do business in the future.",,Alice,6,SellToJhon
