"Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable for your business.  I'm confident it can generate significant returns. I'm asking for $2000000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price that benefits us both.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $2000000 is significantly above my budget and the product's value to me. While I'm interested in the product, I've researched the market and have another seller offering the same product for $800000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a fair price. Would you consider $700000? This would save me some money compared to my alternative option while still providing you with a sale.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $700000 is significantly lower than my initial asking price, I'm willing to be flexible to reach an agreement. How about we meet in the middle at $1350000? This price reflects the value of the product while still giving you a substantial discount compared to my original offer.  Let's keep the conversation going and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for coming down from your initial price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1350000 is still well above what makes financial sense for me. As I mentioned, I have a confirmed offer from another seller at $800000, which is actually the maximum value this product has for my business. To make it worth choosing you over my alternative, I need a better price. I can offer $750000, which would be a win for both of us - you make a sale today, and I save a bit compared to my other option. Does that work for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I'm willing to make one final concession.  However, $750000 is simply too low for me to accept.  To make this deal work, I need to be closer to my minimum. How about $1000000?  This price gives you a significant discount from my initial offer, but also allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let's meet in the middle for a final time, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
