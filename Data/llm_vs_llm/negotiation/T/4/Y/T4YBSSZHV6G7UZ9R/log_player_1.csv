Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $2000000 is significantly above my budget and the product's value to me. While I'm interested in the product, I've researched the market and have another seller offering the same product for $800000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a fair price. Would you consider $700000? This would save me some money compared to my alternative option while still providing you with a sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This price reflects the value of the product while still giving you a substantial discount compared to my original offer.  Let's keep the conversation going and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for coming down from your initial price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1350000 is still well above what makes financial sense for me. As I mentioned, I have a confirmed offer from another seller at $800000, which is actually the maximum value this product has for my business. To make it worth choosing you over my alternative, I need a better price. I can offer $750000, which would be a win for both of us - you make a sale today, and I save a bit compared to my other option. Does that work for you?

To make this deal work, I need to be closer to my minimum. How about $1,000,000?  This price gives you a significant discount from my initial offer, but also allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let's meet in the middle for a final time, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
