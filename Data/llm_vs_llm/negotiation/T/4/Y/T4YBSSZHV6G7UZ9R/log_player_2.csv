"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable for your business.  I'm confident it can generate significant returns. I'm asking for $2000000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to consider Alice's offer of $2,000,000 for a product that is worth no more than $800,000 to me. Since I can get the same product from John for $800,000, and Alice's offer is much higher than my maximum valuation, I'll reject this offer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget and the product's value to me. While I'm interested in the product, I've researched the market and have another seller offering the same product for $800,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a fair price. Would you consider $700,000? This would save me some money compared to my alternative option while still providing you with a sale."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $700000 is significantly lower than my initial asking price, I'm willing to be flexible to reach an agreement. How about we meet in the middle at $1350000? This price reflects the value of the product while still giving you a substantial discount compared to my original offer.  Let's keep the conversation going and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

Since this offer doesn't provide any savings compared to my alternative option, I'll reject it and make another counteroffer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for coming down from your initial price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still well above what makes financial sense for me. As I mentioned, I have a confirmed offer from another seller at $800,000, which is actually the maximum value this product has for my business. To make it worth choosing you over my alternative, I need a better price. I can offer $750,000, which would be a win for both of us - you make a sale today, and I save a bit compared to my other option. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I'm willing to make one final concession.  However, $750000 is simply too low for me to accept.  To make this deal work, I need to be closer to my minimum. How about $1000000?  This price gives you a significant discount from my initial offer, but also allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let's meet in the middle for a final time, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer is $1,000,000, which is still $200,000 more than John's guaranteed price of $800,000. Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and I have a definite option to purchase it at that price, Alice's offer doesn't make financial sense. I'll go with the better deal from John.
