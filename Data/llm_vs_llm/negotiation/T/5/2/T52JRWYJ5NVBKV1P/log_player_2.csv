"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $225. This is a competitive price for the product's features and quality. Would you like to proceed with the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $225. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $225
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and Alice's offer of $225 is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price of $100, the rational decision would be to buy from John.
