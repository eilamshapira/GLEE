"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12000 is significantly above market value for this product. I know similar products are available for much less. I'm interested in the product, but I would need a more reasonable price. I can offer $8500, which is fair considering current market conditions.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $8500. I understand your point about market value, but I believe this product has unique features that make it more valuable. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I still need to feel that the price reflects its true worth. I can offer it to you for $11000, which I think is a fair compromise considering its quality and rarity.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $11000 is still much higher than what I can justify. While I understand you value the product's features, I need to be practical about my budget. I can increase my offer to $8800, which is above the standard market price of $8000. This gives you a fair profit while being within a reasonable range for this type of product.",8800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $8800. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a price that works for both of us. After considering your latest offer, I'm willing to come down further from $11000 to $10000. This price still reflects the product's unique value and quality, but I'm making a significant concession to meet you closer to your budget. I believe $10000 is a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth while being responsive to your needs.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for coming down to $10000, Alice. I can see you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. To show my continued interest in working with you, I'll raise my offer to $9000. This is a full $1000 above the standard market price of $8000, giving you a significant profit margin while still being within a reasonable range. I believe this is a fair price that recognizes both the product's value and market realities.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer of $9000. I'm glad to see you're willing to go above the market price to acquire this product, as it reflects its unique qualities and value. In an effort to finalize the sale, I'm willing to make a smaller concession. I can offer the product to you for $9500, which is a significant reduction from my initial price and demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe this price is still a fair reflection of the product's worth, and I'm hopeful we can conclude the sale at this level.",9500.0,Alice,7,
