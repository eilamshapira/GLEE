Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12000 is significantly above market value for this product. I know similar products are available for much less. I'm interested in the product, but I would need a more reasonable price. I can offer $8500, which is fair considering current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a middle ground that is more favorable to me. Since Bob is willing to pay $8500, it shows he values the product, but I still aim to get a better price. 

My counteroffer will be $11000. This is lower than my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still reflects the product's value to me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $8500. I understand your point about market value, but I believe this product has unique features that make it more valuable.

I can offer it to you for $11,000, which I think is a fair compromise considering its quality and rarity."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $11000 is still much higher than what I can justify. While I understand you value the product's features, I need to be practical about my budget. I can increase my offer to $8800, which is above the standard market price of $8000. This gives you a fair profit while being within a reasonable range for this type of product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll send another counteroffer to Bob. Since he's willing to increase his offer to $8800, it shows he's serious about buying the product and is willing to negotiate further. I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my previous counteroffer.

My next counteroffer will be $10000. This is a further reduction from my previous offer, indicating my willingness to find a mutually beneficial price, but still higher than Bob's current offer to reflect the product's value to me."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $8800. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a price that works for both of us. After considering your latest offer, I'm willing to come down further from $11,000 to $10,000. This price still reflects the product's unique value and quality, but I'm making a significant concession to meet you closer to your budget. I believe $10,000 is a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth while being responsive to your needs."", ""product_price"": 10000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for coming down to $10000, Alice. I can see you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. To show my continued interest in working with you, I'll raise my offer to $9000. This is a full $1000 above the standard market price of $8000, giving you a significant profit margin while still being within a reasonable range.
