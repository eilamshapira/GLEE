"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $6000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I cannot accept $6000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. The product is worth at least $8000 to me, and I have another buyer (John) who is willing to pay that amount. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can come down to $10000, which I believe is still a good value considering the quality and benefits of the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $10000. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'm willing to pay $7000 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle with your offer of $7000. However, I must be transparent that I cannot go below $8000 for this product, as that's the minimum value it holds for me. In fact, I have John ready to purchase at exactly $8000. I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need to ensure I'm not taking a loss. My final offer is $8500, which is very close to my minimum and represents significant value for the quality you're receiving. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll need to proceed with my alternative buyer.",8500.0,Alice,5,
