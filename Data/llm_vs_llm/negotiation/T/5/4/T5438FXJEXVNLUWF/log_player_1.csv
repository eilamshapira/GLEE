Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $6000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I cannot accept $6,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. The product is worth at least $8,000 to me, and I have another buyer (John) who is willing to pay that amount. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can come down to $10,000, which I believe is still a good value considering the quality and benefits of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $10000. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'm willing to pay $7000 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle with your offer of $7,000. However, I must be transparent that I cannot go below $8,000 for this product, as that's the minimum value it holds for me. In fact, I have John ready to purchase at exactly $8,000. I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need to ensure I'm not taking a loss. My final offer is $8,500, which is very close to my minimum and represents significant value for the quality you're receiving. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll need to proceed with my alternative buyer."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
