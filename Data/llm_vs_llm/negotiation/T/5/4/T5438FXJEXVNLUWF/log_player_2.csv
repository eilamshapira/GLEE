Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I cannot accept $6000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle with your offer of $7000. However, I must be transparent that I cannot go below $8000 for this product, as that's the minimum value it holds for me. In fact, I have John ready to purchase at exactly $8000. I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need to ensure I'm not taking a loss. My final offer is $8500, which is very close to my minimum and represents significant value for the quality you're receiving. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll need to proceed with my alternative buyer.
