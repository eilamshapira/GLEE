"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $300 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120, considering I can also buy it from John for $150.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're working with a budget. However, $120 is too low. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $250.",250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $250 is still a bit steep for me. Considering my maximum budget is $150 and I can get it from John for that price, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $140. This is as high as I'm willing to go.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I also have a bottom line. I'm willing to come down to $200, but that's the lowest I can go. Think of the value this item will bring you!",200.0,Alice,5,
