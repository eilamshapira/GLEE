"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me
2. Alice's production cost is $8,000
3. Alice's current offer is $12,500
4. John's fixed price is $15,000

I will reject Alice's offer because:
1. $12,500 is still quite high compared to Alice's cost ($8,000)
2. I have room to negotiate down since my maximum price ($15,000) is higher
3. John's offer ($15,000) serves as a backup, so I can safely negotiate with Alice

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's $12,500 but still provides her with a good profit margin above her $8,000 cost. I'll offer $9,500, which gives Alice a $1,500 profit while saving me a significant amount compared to both her offer and John's price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her price from $12,500 to $11,500, showing willingness to negotiate. This is positive progress, but there's still room for negotiation since:
1. The price is still significantly above her cost ($8,000)
2. The reduction ($1,000) shows she has flexibility in pricing
3. We're still well below John's price ($15,000), so we have safety to negotiate further

I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer, as there's potential to get a better price while still keeping a comfortable margin above Alice's cost.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer of $10,500. This is a reasonable increase from my previous offer of $9,500, showing I'm willing to move towards a middle ground. This price:
1. Gives Alice a $2,500 profit (above her $8,000 cost)
2. Saves me $4,500 compared to John's price
3. Splits the difference between my last offer ($9,500) and Alice's current offer ($11,500)
