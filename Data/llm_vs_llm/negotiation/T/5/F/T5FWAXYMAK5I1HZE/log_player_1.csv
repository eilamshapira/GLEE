Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me make an initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $80 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at $80, I'll start with a higher price to maximize my potential profit.

{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Let me analyze the situation:
1. John's guaranteed offer is $80
2. Bob's current offer is $90, which is $10 more than John's offer
3. While I could try another counteroffer, Bob's offer is already profitable, and there's a risk he might lower his price or walk away

Since $90 is a reasonable offer that gives me $10 more than my guaranteed alternative with John, I'll accept it.
