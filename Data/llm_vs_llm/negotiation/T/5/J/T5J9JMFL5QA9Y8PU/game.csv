"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. It's a substantial investment, but I'm confident you'll see the potential.  What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is too high for me. Since you mentioned the product is worth at least $1000000 to you, I'd like to propose a price of $1050000. This gives you a solid profit margin while being more reasonable for my budget. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While I value your offer, I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1125000?  This still allows me to make a decent return on my investment, but is more in line with your budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
