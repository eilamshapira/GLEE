I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. It's a substantial investment, but I'm confident you'll see the potential.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is too high for me. Since you mentioned the product is worth at least $1000000 to you, I'd like to propose a price of $1050000. This gives you a solid profit margin while being more reasonable for my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I value your offer, I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,125,000?  This still allows me to make a decent return on my investment, but is more in line with your budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
