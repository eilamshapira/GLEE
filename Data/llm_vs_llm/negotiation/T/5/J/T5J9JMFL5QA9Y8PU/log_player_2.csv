"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. It's a substantial investment, but I'm confident you'll see the potential.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice revealed that the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to her
2. She's offering it at $1,200,000, which is equal to John's price
3. There's potential room for negotiation since her minimum value is $1,000,000
4. We have 10 rounds to negotiate, and we can always fall back to John's offer

Since Alice's initial offer is the same as John's price, and we know there's room for negotiation (with her minimum being $1,000,000), it makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice mentioned the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to her, I'll make a counteroffer that's above her stated minimum value but significantly below her asking price. I'll aim for a middle ground that could be attractive to both parties while leaving room for further negotiation if needed.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. Since you mentioned the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to you, I'd like to propose a price of $1,050,000. This gives you a solid profit margin while being more reasonable for my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While I value your offer, I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1125000?  This still allows me to make a decent return on my investment, but is more in line with your budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let's analyze the situation:

1. Alice has moved down from $1,200,000 to $1,125,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. This new price is $75,000 less than John's price
3. She's meeting us halfway between her original offer ($1,200,000) and our counteroffer ($1,050,000)
4. We still have 7 more rounds for negotiation
5. The current offer already saves us $75,000 compared to John's price

While we might be able to negotiate further down, $1,125,000 is a reasonable price that already saves us $75,000 compared to our alternative option with John. There's always a risk that if we push too hard, Alice might become less flexible in future rounds. Given the substantial savings already offered, I think it's wise to accept this offer.
