"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm glad you're interested in the product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Considering its value to you and the current market, I'm offering it to you for $17000. This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, I'll have to sell it to another interested buyer. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to analyze this situation:

- The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me
- Alice is offering it for $17,000
- John is willing to sell the same product for $15,000
- My goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible

Since Alice's price ($17,000) is higher than both the product's worth to me and John's price, the logical choice is to buy from John.
