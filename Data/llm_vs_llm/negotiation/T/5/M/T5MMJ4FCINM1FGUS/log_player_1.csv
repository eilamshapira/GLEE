Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I get more than my minimum acceptable price of $120.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","While $125 is slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $120, I believe I can get a better price by negotiating further with Bob. Since his counteroffer of $125 shows he's willing to negotiate and is already above my minimum, I'll reject and make a new counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob countered with $125, I'll reduce my initial price but still maintain a good margin. I'll propose a price between our last two offers.
