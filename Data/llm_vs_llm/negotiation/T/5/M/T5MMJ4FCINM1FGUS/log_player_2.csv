"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $180 against my alternatives.

Since the product is worth no more than $150 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $150, Alice's offer of $180 is not a good deal for me. I would be paying $30 more than the product's value to me.

Given my options, I should either reject Alice's offer and attempt to negotiate a better price, or just buy from John immediately. Since I have the option to buy from John at any time, it makes sense to try negotiating with Alice first to see if I can get a better price than $150.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice that's lower than my maximum value, giving room for potential negotiation while still seeking a better deal than John's offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has now offered the product for $150, which is exactly the same price as John is offering and matches my maximum value for the product. Since there's no advantage to continuing negotiation or buying from John instead (same price), I'll accept Alice's offer.
