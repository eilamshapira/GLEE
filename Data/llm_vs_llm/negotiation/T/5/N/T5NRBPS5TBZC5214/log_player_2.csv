"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $120
2. Alice is offering the product for $180, which is $60 more than my maximum value
3. John is offering the product for $120, which matches my maximum value

Since Alice's offer ($180) is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price, it wouldn't be rational to accept her offer. John's offer at $120 is the better option.
