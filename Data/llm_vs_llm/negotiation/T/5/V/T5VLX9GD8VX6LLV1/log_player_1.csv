Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","I'll evaluate my options.

Bob is offering $105, which is $5 more than what John would pay ($100). While I initially valued the product higher at $115, getting $105 is still a good outcome since it's more than my minimum acceptable value.
