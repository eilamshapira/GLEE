"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'll evaluate my options here:

1. Accept Alice's offer of $11,000
2. Reject and make a counteroffer
3. Buy from John for $12,000

Alice's product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and I want to save money. John's offer is $12,000, which is my maximum value and more expensive than Alice's current offer. Alice's product costs her $8,000, so there's room for negotiation below $11,000.

I'll reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice that gives me a good savings while still being reasonable considering her costs.

{""product_price"": $9,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I see that Alice has dropped her price from $11,000 to $10,500, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, she rejected my counteroffer of $9,000.

Let me evaluate my options:
1. Accept Alice's offer of $10,500
2. Reject and make another counteroffer
3. Buy from John for $12,000

The $10,500 offer is still better than John's $12,000, so option 3 isn't attractive. I think there's still room to negotiate with Alice since her cost is $8,000.

I'll reject this offer and try again with a higher counteroffer than my previous one.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer to find a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer.

{""product_price"": $9,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I see that Alice has come down from $10,500 to $10,000, which shows she's continuing to negotiate. We're making progress.

Let me evaluate my options:
1. Accept Alice's offer of $10,000
2. Reject and make another counteroffer
3. Buy from John for $12,000

The $10,000 price is a significant improvement and represents a $2,000 savings compared to John's price. However, since we're only in round 5 of 10 possible rounds, and Alice has been willing to lower her price each time, I think there's still room to negotiate further.

I'll reject this offer and try again with a higher counteroffer than my previous one.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer again to continue moving toward a middle ground with Alice.

{""product_price"": $9,700}"
