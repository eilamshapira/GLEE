"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a lower price.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob! I appreciate your interest. While I can't go as low as $80, I can offer you the product for $120. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts!",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to propose a price of $90, which I think is a reasonable compromise.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob! Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're working within a budget, but I can't go as low as $90. How about $110? I think that's a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,5,
