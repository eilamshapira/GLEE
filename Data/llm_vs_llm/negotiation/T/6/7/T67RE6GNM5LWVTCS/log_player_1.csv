I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

$10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to sell it for that price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still trying to get closer to my desired amount. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."

While I would like to get more, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum.  However, I don't think I can get much higher.  I'll take John's offer, as it's guaranteed and meets my minimum price."
