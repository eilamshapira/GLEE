Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 120}

I'm offering $120 because:
1. I know the product is worth $120 to Bob
2. If Bob rejects this offer, I can still sell to John for $120
3. Since this is Bob's maximum value for the product, he should be indifferent between accepting and rejecting
4. There's no reason to offer less since I can guarantee $120 from John
5. Offering more would likely lead to rejection"
