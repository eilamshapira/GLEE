"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since you can buy the product for $120 from John, there's no incentive to accept Alice's offer at the same price. You should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
