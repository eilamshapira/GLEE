"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product we've discussed. I believe you'll find it incredibly valuable. I can offer it to you for $1400000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and also less than John's offer. Accepting this offer saves you money."
