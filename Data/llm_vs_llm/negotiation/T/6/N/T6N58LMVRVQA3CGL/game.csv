,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, I'm afraid $15000 is well above my budget. Based on my market research and personal budget constraints, I can offer $6000 for the product. This is a serious offer that I hope we can use as a starting point for our negotiation.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $6000. I understand that $15000 may be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than your offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to lower my initial offer, but not as low as $6000. I'd like to propose a price of $12000, which I think is a fair reflection of the product's value.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice. However, $12000 is still significantly above what I can afford. I've done extensive market research, and similar products are available for much less. I can increase my offer to $7000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer and reflects the maximum I can reasonably stretch my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $7000. I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, I still need to ensure that I'm getting a fair price for the product. After considering your market research and budget constraints, I'm willing to make a concession. I'd like to propose a price of $10000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price takes into account the product's value and your willingness to negotiate. I hope we can find a mutually acceptable price soon.",10000.0,Alice,5,
