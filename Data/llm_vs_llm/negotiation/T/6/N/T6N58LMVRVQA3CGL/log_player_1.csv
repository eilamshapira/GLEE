"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to sell it to you at a competitive price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, I'm afraid $15000 is well above my budget. Based on my market research and personal budget constraints, I can offer $6000 for the product. This is a serious offer that I hope we can use as a starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $6,000 because it's significantly lower than the product's value to me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to find a price that better reflects the product's worth. I'll proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer to Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $6,000. I understand that $15,000 may be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than your offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to lower my initial offer, but not as low as $6,000. I'd like to propose a price of $12,000, which I think is a fair reflection of the product's value."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice. However, $12000 is still significantly above what I can afford. I've done extensive market research, and similar products are available for much less. I can increase my offer to $7000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer and reflects the maximum I can reasonably stretch my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $7,000 because it's still below my minimum acceptable price. While I appreciate Bob's willingness to increase his offer, I believe the product is worth more. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I'd like to explore the possibility of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob. I'll proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $7,000. I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, I still need to ensure that I'm getting a fair price for the product. After considering your market research and budget constraints, I'm willing to make a concession. I'd like to propose a price of $10,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price takes into account the product's value and your willingness to negotiate. I hope we can find a mutually acceptable price soon."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
