"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to sell it to you at a competitive price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","The initial offer of $15,000 from Alice is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000, and it's also higher than John's guaranteed price of $8,000. Since I can only spend up to $8,000, I should reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, I'm afraid $15,000 is well above my budget. Based on my market research and personal budget constraints, I can offer $6,000 for the product. This is a serious offer that I hope we can use as a starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $6000. I understand that $15000 may be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than your offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to lower my initial offer, but not as low as $6000. I'd like to propose a price of $12000, which I think is a fair reflection of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's new offer of $12,000 is still substantially above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000). While Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing the price from $15,000 to $12,000, it's still too high. At this point, I can either continue negotiating or take John's offer. Since Alice seems willing to negotiate but is still far from my target price, I'll reject and try one more counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still keep it below my maximum value, showing some flexibility while maintaining room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice. However, $12,000 is still significantly above what I can afford. I've done extensive market research, and similar products are available for much less. I can increase my offer to $7,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer and reflects the maximum I can reasonably stretch my budget."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $7000. I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, I still need to ensure that I'm getting a fair price for the product. After considering your market research and budget constraints, I'm willing to make a concession. I'd like to propose a price of $10000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price takes into account the product's value and your willingness to negotiate. I hope we can find a mutually acceptable price soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","While Alice continues to show flexibility by reducing the price to $10,000, this is still above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's guaranteed price ($8,000). Given that:
1. Alice has reduced the price from $15,000 → $12,000 → $10,000, showing significant movement
2. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation
3. I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $8,000
4. Alice's current price is still above my maximum value

At this point, it would be best to take John's offer rather than continue negotiating, as Alice seems unlikely to drop the price below $8,000 given her current negotiation pattern.
