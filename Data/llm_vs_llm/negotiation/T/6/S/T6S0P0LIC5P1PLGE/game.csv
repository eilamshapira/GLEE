"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out, but $180 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my research and budget constraints, I can offer $90 for it. This is a fair price considering similar products in the market. Let me know if this works for you.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept $90 as it's below my cost. However, I understand your budget concerns, so I'm willing to reduce my initial price. Given the product's quality and value, I can offer it to you for $150. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents great value for this product.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $150 is still above what I'm prepared to pay. I have another seller offering the same product for $120, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer $105 for the product, which is a fair compromise between our positions. This is a better deal for me than my alternative option, and hopefully still works for you.",105.0,Bob,4,
