"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a great product to offer you today. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out, but $180 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my research and budget constraints, I can offer $90 for it. This is a fair price considering similar products in the market. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100 (and even below John's guaranteed offer), I'll reject this offer. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, coming down a bit from my initial price to show flexibility but still maintaining a profitable margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept $90 as it's below my cost. However, I understand your budget concerns, so I'm willing to reduce my initial price. Given the product's quality and value, I can offer it to you for $150. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents great value for this product."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $150 is still above what I'm prepared to pay. I have another seller offering the same product for $120, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer $105 for the product, which is a fair compromise between our positions. This is a better deal for me than my alternative option, and hopefully still works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $105. This is a reasonable deal because:
1. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $100
2. It's better than John's guaranteed offer of $100
3. Bob has indicated he has another option at $120, so pushing for much more might cause him to walk away
4. We've achieved a compromise that benefits both parties
5. We can close the deal now rather than risk further negotiations that might break down"
