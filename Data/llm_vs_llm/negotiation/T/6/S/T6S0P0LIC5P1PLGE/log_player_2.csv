"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a great product to offer you today. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering the product at $180, but I know that it's worth no more than $120 to me. John is willing to sell me the same product for $120, which is my maximum value for it.

It would make sense to try negotiating with Alice before going to John, to see if I can get an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out, but $180 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my research and budget constraints, I can offer $90 for it. This is a fair price considering similar products in the market. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept $90 as it's below my cost. However, I understand your budget concerns, so I'm willing to reduce my initial price. Given the product's quality and value, I can offer it to you for $150. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents great value for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has come down from $180 to $150, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $150 is still above the $120 that John is offering and above what the product is worth to me. I should continue negotiating to see if I can get Alice to lower her price further, but keep in mind that I can always go to John if the negotiation doesn't go well.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $150 is still above what I'm prepared to pay. I have another seller offering the same product for $120, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer $105 for the product, which is a fair compromise between our positions. This is a better deal for me than my alternative option, and hopefully still works for you."", ""product_price"": 105}"
