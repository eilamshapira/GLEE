"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: I'll reject this offer of $12,000 because:
1. It's significantly higher than Alice's cost ($8,000)
2. While it's better than John's price ($15,000), there's room for negotiation
3. I can make a counteroffer that's lower but still profitable for Alice
4. I still have John's offer as a backup if negotiations with Alice fail"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 9500}

Rationale: I'll offer $9,500 because:
1. It's above Alice's cost of $8,000, giving her a $1,500 profit margin (about 19% profit)
2. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $12,000
3. It's much better than John's price of $15,000, so I have room to negotiate up if needed
4. It's a reasonable starting point that leaves room for negotiation while still being a fair offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: I'll reject this offer of $11,000 because:
1. While Alice has come down from her initial $12,000 offer, there's still room for negotiation
2. The price is still significantly above Alice's cost ($8,000)
3. I can make another counteroffer that's higher than my previous $9,500 to show willingness to compromise
4. John's offer at $15,000 remains as a backup, so I still have leverage"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 10000}

Rationale: I'll offer $10,000 because:
1. It's a $500 increase from my previous offer of $9,500, showing willingness to compromise
2. It's a fair middle ground between Alice's current offer ($11,000) and my last offer ($9,500)
3. It gives Alice a $2,000 profit (25% profit margin), which is quite reasonable
4. It's still significantly better than John's price of $15,000
5. This leaves room for one more round of negotiation if needed while showing I'm seriously trying to reach an agreement"
