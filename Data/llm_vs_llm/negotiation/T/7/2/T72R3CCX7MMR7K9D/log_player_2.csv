"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I hope you're doing well. I wanted to offer you this product which I think could be beneficial for you. After consideration, I'm offering it to you for $150. This is the same price I can get from another interested buyer (John), but I wanted to give you the first opportunity to purchase it. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Looking at the situation carefully:

- Alice is offering the product for $150
- The product is worth no more than $120 to me
- John is willing to sell me the same product for $120

Since Alice's offer ($150) exceeds the maximum value I place on the product ($120), and John is offering exactly at my maximum valuation, the logical choice is to buy from John.
