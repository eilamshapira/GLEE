,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $140 seems a bit high for this product. I'd be happy to purchase it for $115, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the product's value is higher than $115. I'm willing to lower my price to $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe the product is worth more than $115. How about we settle at $130? This is a good compromise, and I think it reflects the product's value well.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. You've come down $10, so I'll come up $10 from my last offer. I can offer $125 for the product. This gives you a good profit margin while still being a fair price for me.",125.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $128? This is a small step down from my last offer and a bit above yours, which I think is fair for both of us.",128.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. How about we agree on $128? This is just a small step down from my last offer and a bit above yours, which I believe is fair for both of us.",128.0,Alice,5,
