"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $25000. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $25000 is more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested, but my budget is lower. How about $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $10000 is below my minimum threshold for this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. How about $20000? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my willingness to work with you.",20000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that my last offer might still be a bit high for you. I'm willing to come down further to $18000. This price reflects the value of the product and my desire to reach an agreement with you. What do you say?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18000 is still too high for me. I value the product, but I'm sticking to my budget. I can offer $12000.",12000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is still below what I'm looking for. Let's try to meet in the middle. How about $16000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate.",16000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're getting closer, but I need to ensure the price reflects the product's value. How about we settle at $15000? This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,5,
