Send your offer to Bob.,"Since I know my product is worth at least $1,000,000 (as I have a guaranteed buyer at that price), I'll start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

{""product_price"": 1,500,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly the same as John's guaranteed offer ($1,000,000), and there's uncertainty in continuing negotiations with Bob, I'll choose to sell to John to secure the guaranteed amount.
