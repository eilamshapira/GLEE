"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given that Alice's offer is $95 and John's fixed price is $100, it's better to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, there's room for negotiation to get a better price. $95 is too close to John's price of $100, so we can try to negotiate down.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's $95 but still above her cost of $80, aiming for a middle ground that could be acceptable to both parties.

{""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has reduced her price from $95 to $90, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is a better price than both her initial offer and John's price of $100. However, since we know her cost is $80 and we still have 7 rounds left for negotiation, we can try one more time to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down from $95 to $90, and rejected our previous offer of $85, I'll try to meet in the middle between our last positions.

{""product_price"": 87}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has moved only slightly from $90 to $89, showing she's becoming less flexible in her pricing. While we could continue negotiating, we've already gotten the price down $6 from her initial offer, and $89 is significantly better than John's price of $100. Given that we're halfway through our rounds and the movement is becoming minimal, it's reasonable to accept this offer.
