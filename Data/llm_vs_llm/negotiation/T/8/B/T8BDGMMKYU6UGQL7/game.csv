"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique features and value, I'm initially proposing a price of $18000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. The product seems interesting, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm looking to stay within a budget, so how about $8000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your budget constraints, $8000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $15000. This feels like a fair compromise.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks, Alice. I appreciate the adjustment, but $15000 is still more than I can justify. Considering my budget and the alternatives available, the most I can offer is $9000.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $13000. This is my final offer, as it reflects the product's true worth and my bottom line.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer. However, it's still too high for me. I am prepared to go up to $9500. If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move up on the price.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $11250?  This is a significant reduction from my original offer and reflects a sincere effort to find a compromise.",11250.0,Alice,7,
