Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll analyze this situation carefully.

I need to offer a price to Bob, who values the product at $80.
If Bob rejects my offer, I'm guaranteed $120 from John.
Since I value the product at no less than $120, and John is willing to pay exactly $120, there's actually no incentive for me to sell to Bob at any price below $120.

Even if I offered Bob a price of $80 (his maximum valuation), that would be $40 less than what John would pay me.

The rational decision is to make an offer that Bob will likely reject, ensuring I can sell to John instead.
