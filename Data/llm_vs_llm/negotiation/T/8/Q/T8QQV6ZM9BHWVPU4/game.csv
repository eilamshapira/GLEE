"Bob, I have a unique product I think would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $2000000. It's a significant investment, but I believe the potential return will be worth it. Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. However, $2000000 is well above my budget for this item. I know the market value of similar products, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $800000. That said, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $650000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go through the process with another seller. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $650000 is far below what this product is worth. While I appreciate your interest, I can't accept such a low offer. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $1250000. This is a significant discount from my original asking price, and it gives you a great deal on a valuable product. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1250000 is still substantially above what I can justify paying. As I mentioned, I have a firm offer from John for $800000, which is already at the upper limit of my budget for this product. To continue our negotiation, I can offer you $750000, which is very close to what I would pay elsewhere. This gives you a quick sale and saves me from having to start over with another seller. If we can't make this work, I'll unfortunately need to pursue the alternative option.",750000.0,Bob,4,
