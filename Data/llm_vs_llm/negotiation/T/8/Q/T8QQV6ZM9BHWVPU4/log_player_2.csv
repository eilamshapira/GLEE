"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product I think would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $2000000. It's a significant investment, but I believe the potential return will be worth it. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is offering the product for $2,000,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000. Since I know I can buy the same product from John for exactly $800,000, and this matches my maximum value for the product, there's no reason to pay more than that.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. However, $2,000,000 is well above my budget for this item. I know the market value of similar products, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $800,000. That said, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go through the process with another seller. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 650000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $650000 is far below what this product is worth. While I appreciate your interest, I can't accept such a low offer. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $1250000. This is a significant discount from my original asking price, and it gives you a great deal on a valuable product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,250,000 is still significantly higher than my maximum value for the product ($800,000) and higher than John's guaranteed price. There's no reason for me to accept this offer when I can get the exact same product for $800,000 from John.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is still substantially above what I can justify paying. As I mentioned, I have a firm offer from John for $800,000, which is already at the upper limit of my budget for this product. To continue our negotiation, I can offer you $750,000, which is very close to what I would pay elsewhere. This gives you a quick sale and saves me from having to start over with another seller. If we can't make this work, I'll unfortunately need to pursue the alternative option."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
