Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to set a price that maximizes my profit while ensuring Bob is likely to accept the offer.

Bob values the product at $1,500,000, while I value it at no less than $800,000. If Bob rejects my offer, I can sell to John for $800,000.

For Bob to accept, he must see value in the transaction. If I price too close to $1,500,000, he might reject it. However, I want to capture as much of the surplus value as possible.

A reasonable strategy is to offer Bob a price that gives him some discount from his maximum value, while still providing me with significantly more than my minimum acceptable amount.
