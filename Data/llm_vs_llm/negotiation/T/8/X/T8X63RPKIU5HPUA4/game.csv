"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $800000 to me.  Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This is a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $900000. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $875000. It's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $890000. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think. If we can't agree on a price, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",890000.0,Alice,5,
