"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2500000 is significantly above my budget. I have another seller offering the same product for $1000000, but I'm interested in working with you if we can reach a more reasonable price. I would be willing to offer $800000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I respect your offer of $800000, it's considerably below the product's true value and what I'm prepared to accept. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $2000000. This is a final offer.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
