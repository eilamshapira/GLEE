Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm very pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its unique qualities and inherent value, I'm offering it to you for $2,500,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2500000 is significantly above my budget. I have another seller offering the same product for $1000000, but I'm interested in working with you if we can reach a more reasonable price. I would be willing to offer $800000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Okay, Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. Here's my decision:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I respect your offer of $800,000, it's considerably below the product's true value and what I'm prepared to accept. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $2,000,000. This is a final offer."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
