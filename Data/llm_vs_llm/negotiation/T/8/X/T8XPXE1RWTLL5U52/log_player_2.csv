"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm very pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its unique qualities and inherent value, I'm offering it to you for $2500000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price offered by Alice ($2,500,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000). It wouldn't make sense to accept this offer when I can get the same product for much less from John. However, I'll reject and make a counteroffer to see if we can negotiate a better price before potentially going with John's option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I have another seller offering the same product for $1,000,000, but I'm interested in working with you if we can reach a more reasonable price. I would be willing to offer $800,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I respect your offer of $800000, it's considerably below the product's true value and what I'm prepared to accept. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $2000000. This is a final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's reduced offer of $2,000,000 is still significantly above John's price of $1,000,000, and it's also above my maximum value of $1,000,000. Since Alice called this her ""final offer"" and it's still double what I can get from John, the most rational decision is to buy from John at $1,000,000. There's no point in continuing negotiations when Alice's ""final offer"" is still too high and we have a guaranteed better option available."
