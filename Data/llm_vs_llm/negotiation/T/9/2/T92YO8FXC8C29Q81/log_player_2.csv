"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Based on the information you've provided:

- The product is worth no more than $8,000 to you
- Alice is offering to sell it for $15,000
- John is willing to sell the same product for $8,000

Since Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than both the product's worth to you and John's offer, the rational choice would be to buy from John instead.
