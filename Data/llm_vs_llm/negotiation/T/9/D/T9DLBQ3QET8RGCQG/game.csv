"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm thinking something closer to $800000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1000000? This price still reflects the value of the product while allowing for a reasonable deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
