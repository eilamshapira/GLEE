Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm thinking something closer to $800000 would be more reasonable. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
