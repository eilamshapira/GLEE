"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I believe it holds tremendous potential for your business. My initial offer is $1200000.  This price reflects the inherent worth of the product and its future prospects. I'm open to discussing your perspective and exploring a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1000000? This price still reflects the value of the product while allowing for a reasonable deal for both of us.

Alice is clearly trying to get me to her price point, which is the same as John's.  There's no benefit to continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point."
