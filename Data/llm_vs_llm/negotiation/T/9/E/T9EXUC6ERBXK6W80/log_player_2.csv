"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it at $180, which represents excellent value given its features and quality. Would you like to purchase it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $120
2. Alice is offering the product for $180
3. John is offering the same product for $120

Since Alice's offer ($180) is higher than both:
- My maximum value ($120)
- John's alternative price ($120)

It doesn't make economic sense to accept Alice's offer. Since John's price matches my maximum value and is significantly lower than Alice's offer, I should buy from John.
