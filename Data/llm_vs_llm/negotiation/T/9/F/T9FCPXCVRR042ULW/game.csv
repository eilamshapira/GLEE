"Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a truly unique and valuable product. I believe it will be a significant asset for you. I'm asking $25000 for it.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I'm not willing to pay $25000 for the product. I believe a more reasonable price would be $5000, considering my budget and the product's potential value to me.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $5000 is far below the product's value. I understand budget constraints, but I cannot accept such a low price. How about we meet in the middle a bit? I'll come down to $22000.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $22000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer, but I need a more significant reduction from your side. I'll offer $7000, which is the highest I'm comfortable with at this point.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $7000 is still too low. I'm willing to work with you, but I also have a bottom line. Let's try $19000. That's a significant drop from my initial price.",19000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate the further reduction in price. However, $19000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer $8500, which is getting close to my maximum limit. I hope we can meet somewhere around this price.",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but we're still quite far apart. I'm starting to consider other offers, but I'm willing to give it one more try with you. I'll go down to $16000. This is getting very close to my absolute minimum.",16000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to lower the price. However, $16000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. Considering your statement that $16000 is close to your minimum, I'll make a serious effort to meet you halfway. I'll offer $9500, which is very close to my maximum budget. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",9500.0,Bob,8,
