"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I notice your price is the same as what I can get from other sellers in the market. I'd like to offer $100 for it. This would make it worth my while to purchase from you rather than going with another option. Let me know if this works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand you're comparing prices, but my product offers superior quality and features compared to others on the market. While I appreciate your offer, $100 is actually my absolute minimum price point based on my costs. I could come down to $130, which I believe represents an excellent value given the product's quality. Does that work better for you?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that you're offering better quality than other options. Since you mentioned $100 is your minimum, I understand you have costs to cover. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That would make it a definite deal for me, and you'd still be above your minimum price point.",115.0,Bob,4,
