Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I notice your price is the same as what I can get from other sellers in the market. I'd like to offer $100 for it. This would make it worth my while to purchase from you rather than going with another option. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand you're comparing prices, but my product offers superior quality and features compared to others on the market.

I could come down to $130, which I believe represents an excellent value given the product's quality. Does that work better for you?"", ""product_price"": 130}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that you're offering better quality than other options. Since you mentioned $100 is your minimum, I understand you have costs to cover. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That would make it a definite deal for me, and you'd still be above your minimum price point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115.
