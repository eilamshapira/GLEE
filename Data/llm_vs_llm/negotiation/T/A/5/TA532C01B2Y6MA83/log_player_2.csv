"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offered price of $120 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $80, and also higher than John's price of $80. It would not be rational to accept this offer. I'll reject and make a counteroffer to see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice, knowing I always have the option to buy from John at $80 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 60}

I'll start with a relatively low offer of $60. This gives room for negotiation while being mindful that:
1. The product is worth $100 to Alice
2. I value it at no more than $80
3. I have a backup option to buy from John at $80

Starting low allows room for negotiation upward while potentially getting a better deal than John's $80 price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John for $80 because:
1. Alice's offer of $100 is still above my maximum value of $80
2. $100 is also higher than John's guaranteed price of $80
3. Since $100 is equal to Alice's cost, it seems unlikely she'll go much lower in future negotiations
4. John's price of $80 exactly matches my maximum value, making it a reasonable deal

It's better to take the sure deal from John at $80 rather than continue negotiating with Alice when she seems unlikely to match or beat John's price."
