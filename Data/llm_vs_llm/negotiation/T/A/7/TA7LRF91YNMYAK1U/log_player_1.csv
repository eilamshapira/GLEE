(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer is exactly equal to John's standing offer and equal to my minimum acceptable price, there's no advantage in accepting Bob's offer over selling to John. However, since Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get a better price.
