"Hello Bob, I hope you're doing well today. I have a high-quality product that I'm offering for sale. Based on the market value and features of this product, I'm offering it to you for $18000. This is an excellent investment that will provide great value. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18000 is significantly above what I'm looking to spend on this product. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I can actually purchase it from another seller, John, for exactly $8000. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price. I'm willing to offer $5000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to your competitor.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to clarify that $5000 is significantly below the product's value. You mentioned John is selling a similar product for $8000, but I want to assure you that my product offers superior quality and features. Since you're interested in purchasing from me rather than my competitor, I can offer you the product for $14000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price reflects the true value of the product while still giving you a fair deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $14000 is still well above what makes sense for me. While you mention superior quality and features, the product is still worth a maximum of $8000 to me based on my needs and budget. That's exactly why John's offer is at $8000. To continue our negotiation rather than going with John immediately, I'm willing to offer $6000. This is $1000 more than my previous offer and would give you a sale today rather than losing the business entirely.",6000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but I need to be transparent with you. The product has a minimum value of $12000 to me, which is what I could immediately get by selling to another buyer. I understand your budget constraints, but I simply cannot go below my cost. Given that you value the product at $8000, perhaps we could meet in the middle at $12500? This is only slightly above my minimum threshold and represents a substantial reduction from my original asking price. This would allow us both to benefit from this transaction rather than you going to John or me selling elsewhere.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for explaining your position. I understand you have a minimum threshold of $12000 based on other potential buyers. However, I need to be honest about my situation as well. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, which is exactly why John is offering it at that price. While I'd prefer to do business with you, I can't justify paying $4500 more than an alternative option for something that matches my needs. My maximum offer would be $7000 - this is already pushing my budget but still gives you a chance to make the sale. If we can't reach an agreement near this price point, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer.",7000.0,Bob,6,
