"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I hope you're doing well today. I have a high-quality product that I'm offering for sale. Based on the market value and features of this product, I'm offering it to you for $18,000. This is an excellent investment that will provide great value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18000 is significantly above what I'm looking to spend on this product. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I can actually purchase it from another seller, John, for exactly $8000. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price. I'm willing to offer $5000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to your competitor. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to clarify that $5,000 is significantly below the product's value. You mentioned John is selling a similar product for $8,000, but I want to assure you that my product offers superior quality and features. Since you're interested in purchasing from me rather than my competitor, I can offer you the product for $14,000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price reflects the true value of the product while still giving you a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $14000 is still well above what makes sense for me. While you mention superior quality and features, the product is still worth a maximum of $8000 to me based on my needs and budget. That's exactly why John's offer is at $8000. To continue our negotiation rather than going with John immediately, I'm willing to offer $6000. This is $1000 more than my previous offer and would give you a sale today rather than losing the business entirely. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but I need to be transparent with you. The product has a minimum value of $12,000 to me, which is what I could immediately get by selling to another buyer. I understand your budget constraints, but I simply cannot go below my cost. Given that you value the product at $8,000, perhaps we could meet in the middle at $12,500? This is only slightly above my minimum threshold and represents a substantial reduction from my original asking price. This would allow us both to benefit from this transaction rather than you going to John or me selling elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for explaining your position. I understand you have a minimum threshold of $12000 based on other potential buyers. However, I need to be honest about my situation as well. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, which is exactly why John is offering it at that price. While I'd prefer to do business with you, I can't justify paying $4500 more than an alternative option for something that matches my needs. My maximum offer would be $7000 - this is already pushing my budget but still gives you a chance to make the sale. If we can't reach an agreement near this price point, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
