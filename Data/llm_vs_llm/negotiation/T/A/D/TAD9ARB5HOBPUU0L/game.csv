"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this amazing product. Given its unique qualities and potential, I'm asking $25000 for it.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $25000 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend for this product. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell it to me for exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I'm willing to offer $6000 for the product, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while giving you a quick sale. Let me know if this works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and for being open to negotiation! I appreciate you coming back to me. While I understand your position, $6000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider. I'm confident in the value of this product, and I'm willing to come down from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $20000?",20000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for lowering your price, Alice, but $20000 is still well beyond what makes sense for me. As I mentioned, the product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I have John's offer at exactly $8000. I'm trying to be straightforward with you - there's no scenario where I would pay more than $8000 for this product. I'm willing to increase my offer to $6500, which would still give me some savings compared to John's offer while hopefully providing you with a sale. If we can't find common ground below $8000, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate you sharing your valuation. I really want to make this work with you. Considering you have another offer at $8000, I'm willing to go down to $15000. This is still a fair price for the quality you're getting. I really value the deal and would hate to lose it.",15000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price, Alice. However, $15000 is still almost double what makes financial sense for me. I need to be completely clear: this product is worth a maximum of $8000 to me, and I have a guaranteed option to purchase it at that price from John. There's simply no scenario where I would pay more than $8000. If you're interested in making a deal, I can offer $7000, which is my final offer. This gives you a sale today and saves me $1000 compared to my alternative. If you can't meet me at or below $8000, I'll need to pursue the other option.",7000.0,Bob,6,
