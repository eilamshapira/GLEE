"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this amazing product. Given its unique qualities and potential, I'm asking $25,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $25000 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend for this product. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell it to me for exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I'm willing to offer $6000 for the product, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while giving you a quick sale. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Okay, I have a tough decision to make. Bob's offer of $6,000 is less than what I'm willing to accept (my minimum is $10,000). However, I also need to consider that John is offering $10,000, and I have limited rounds.

Given the situation, I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and for being open to negotiation! I appreciate you coming back to me. While I understand your position, $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider. I'm confident in the value of this product, and I'm willing to come down from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $20,000?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for lowering your price, Alice, but $20000 is still well beyond what makes sense for me. As I mentioned, the product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I have John's offer at exactly $8000. I'm trying to be straightforward with you - there's no scenario where I would pay more than $8000 for this product. I'm willing to increase my offer to $6500, which would still give me some savings compared to John's offer while hopefully providing you with a sale. If we can't find common ground below $8000, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Okay, Bob is sticking firm at $8,000, and I'm still at a loss. I'm now in round 4, and I'm getting a little worried that Bob might go with John's offer. My best bet is to try and get closer to my minimum value of $10,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, let's try this:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate you sharing your valuation. I really want to make this work with you. Considering you have another offer at $8,000, I'm willing to go down to $15,000. This is still a fair price for the quality you're getting. I really value the deal and would hate to lose it."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price, Alice. However, $15000 is still almost double what makes financial sense for me. I need to be completely clear: this product is worth a maximum of $8000 to me, and I have a guaranteed option to purchase it at that price from John. There's simply no scenario where I would pay more than $8000. If you're interested in making a deal, I can offer $7000, which is my final offer. This gives you a sale today and saves me $1000 compared to my alternative. If you can't meet me at or below $8000, I'll need to pursue the other option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a tough call. Bob is adamant at $8,000, and I'm losing ground. I'm now in round 6, and I could end up with nothing if I don't close soon. Bob's latest offer is $7,000, which is still lower than my $10,000 minimum. I'm starting to think I won't get a higher price with Bob. However, I still have John's offer of $10,000.

Given the situation, I think it's time to cut my losses and go for the guaranteed $10,000 with John.
