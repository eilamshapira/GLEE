"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this amazing product. Given its unique qualities and potential, I'm asking $25000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","The price Alice is offering is $25,000, which is significantly higher than the product's worth to me ($8,000) and also much higher than John's price of $8,000. There's no reason to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $25,000 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend for this product. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell it to me for exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I'm willing to offer $6,000 for the product, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while giving you a quick sale. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and for being open to negotiation! I appreciate you coming back to me. While I understand your position, $6000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider. I'm confident in the value of this product, and I'm willing to come down from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $20000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her offer from $25,000 to $20,000, but this is still far above what the product is worth to me ($8,000) and higher than John's offer of $8,000. There's no reason to accept this offer when I have a much better alternative.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for lowering your price, Alice, but $20,000 is still well beyond what makes sense for me. As I mentioned, the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and I have John's offer at exactly $8,000. I'm trying to be straightforward with you - there's no scenario where I would pay more than $8,000 for this product. I'm willing to increase my offer to $6,500, which would still give me some savings compared to John's offer while hopefully providing you with a sale. If we can't find common ground below $8,000, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 6500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate you sharing your valuation. I really want to make this work with you. Considering you have another offer at $8000, I'm willing to go down to $15000. This is still a fair price for the quality you're getting. I really value the deal and would hate to lose it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's new offer of $15,000 is still well above both the product's worth to me ($8,000) and John's offer ($8,000). Alice seems to be making significant reductions but is still far from a price that would make sense for me to accept.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price, Alice. However, $15,000 is still almost double what makes financial sense for me. I need to be completely clear: this product is worth a maximum of $8,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed option to purchase it at that price from John. There's simply no scenario where I would pay more than $8,000. If you're interested in making a deal, I can offer $7,000, which is my final offer. This gives you a sale today and saves me $1,000 compared to my alternative. If you can't meet me at or below $8,000, I'll need to pursue the other option."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
