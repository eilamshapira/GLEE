"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Given the options:

*   **Alice's offer:** $120
*   **Buy from John:** $150

Since the offer from Alice is $120, which is less than the $150 from John, and also within my budget of $150, the best decision is to accept the offer.
