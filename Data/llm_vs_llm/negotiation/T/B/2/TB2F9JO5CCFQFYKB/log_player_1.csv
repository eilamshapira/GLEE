"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a premium product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it for $180. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in your product, but $180 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at the moment. Would you be willing to come down to $100?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer because $100 is below my minimum value ($120), and I can try to negotiate for a better price before considering John's offer as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for this product given its quality and value. I can offer it to you for $150, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I'm still only comfortable going up to $120. Would you consider that?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob is offering the same price as John ($120), and we've been negotiating without reaching a better deal, I'll choose to sell to John. There's no advantage in continuing negotiations with Bob when I have a guaranteed buyer at the same price."
