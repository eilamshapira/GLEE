"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Okay, let's analyze this.

*   **Alice's Offer:** $950,000
*   **My Value:** $1,000,000 (maximum I'm willing to pay)
*   **Alice's Value:** $800,000
*   **John's Offer:** $1,000,000

Since the offer from Alice is less than the value I have for the product. And buying the product from Alice is a better deal than buying from John. I should accept the offer.
