Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. Since I know I can get $100 from John as a guaranteed backup option, I can be somewhat aggressive with my offer to Bob. A reasonable markup would be to try selling it for $150, which:

1. Gives me a good profit if Bob accepts
2. Still might be attractive to Bob if the product is worth more to him
3. Doesn't risk anything since I have John's $100 offer as a safety net
