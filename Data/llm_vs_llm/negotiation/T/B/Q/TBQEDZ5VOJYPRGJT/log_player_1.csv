Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I certainly can't go as low as $60, but I'm willing to negotiate.

How about this?

I understand that $100 might be too high for you, so I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $90? This is a fair price considering the value of the product."

We're getting closer to an agreement. I appreciate your effort to meet me in the middle, but $70 is still a bit low for me. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.

Please consider my new offer.

I understand that we both want to find a fair price for the product. I've come down significantly from my original asking price. Let's meet in the middle at $85. This way, we both get a good deal."
