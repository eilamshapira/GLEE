"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is far beyond my budget. The market value for similar products is much lower, and I have another seller offering the same product for $8000. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can offer $6000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but considering the value and quality of my product, I cannot go as low as $6000. I can offer it to you for $16000. Let's find a reasonable middle ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $16000 is still significantly above market value. I want to be transparent - my absolute maximum budget is $8000, and I have a confirmed offer from another seller at that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you. I can raise my previous offer to $7000, which would be my best price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
