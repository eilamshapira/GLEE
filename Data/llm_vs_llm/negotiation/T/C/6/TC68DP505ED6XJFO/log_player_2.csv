"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe will bring great value to you. I'm pleased to offer it to you at a price of $20000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let me explain my reasoning: Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative offer ($8,000). It would be irrational to accept this offer when I have a much better alternative. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round, as there's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice than even John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is far beyond my budget. The market value for similar products is much lower, and I have another seller offering the same product for $8,000. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can offer $6,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 6000}

I'm offering $6,000 because:
1. It's below my maximum value of $8,000
2. It's below John's price of $8,000
3. It gives room for negotiation to potentially reach a price that's beneficial for both parties
4. By mentioning the competing offer of $8,000, I'm establishing a credible ceiling for negotiations"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but considering the value and quality of my product, I cannot go as low as $6000. I can offer it to you for $16000. Let's find a reasonable middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $16,000, while lower than her initial offer, is still double my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000). While she's showing willingness to negotiate by reducing her price, the current offer is still not acceptable. I'll continue negotiating as there might be room for further price reduction, though if we can't reach a reasonable price point, I always have John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $16,000 is still significantly above market value. I want to be transparent - my absolute maximum budget is $8,000, and I have a confirmed offer from another seller at that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you. I can raise my previous offer to $7,000, which would be my best price."", ""product_price"": 7000}

I'm offering $7,000 because:
1. It shows I'm willing to move up from my previous offer of $6,000, demonstrating good faith in negotiations
2. It's still below both my maximum value and John's price, giving me room to maneuver
3. I'm being transparent about my budget constraint and alternative option to establish credibility
4. If Alice refuses, I can still take John's offer without any loss"
