"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm very interested in your product, but $300 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate you taking the time to consider the value of the product. While $100 is lower than I can accept, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $250?",250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $250 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  How about $150? That's a significant reduction from your initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering my budget.",150.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand budget constraints. I'm really trying to work with you here. Let's try this: $200. That's as low as I can realistically go.",200.0,Alice,5,
