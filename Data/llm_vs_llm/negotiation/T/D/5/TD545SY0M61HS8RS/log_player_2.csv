"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know if you'd like to take it at this price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:

Let's see if Alice is willing to lower her price. If not, I can always buy from John later.

**Counteroffer:**
Let's say I'm interested, but $150 is too high for me. How about I offer you $100 instead?"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","**{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to spend no more than $100. Would you be willing to sell the product for this price?"", ""product_price"": 100}**

Let's see if Alice will accept the counteroffer of $100. If she declines, I can consider buying from John for $150."

# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but the lowest I can go on this product is $130. It's a great deal at this price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. Let me know if you'd like to proceed at this price!

I'd like to try negotiating a bit more before accepting Alice's offer or buying from John.

**Counteroffer:**
Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still looking to spend less. How about we meet in the middle at $115?"
