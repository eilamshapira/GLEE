Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1100000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd be willing to pay $950000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
