"Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $12000. This is a great deal considering its value and quality. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? This price still offers you significant value while being more within your budget.",11000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're close to reaching an agreement. I'm willing to lower the price a bit more to $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10500 is still a bit high for me. Could you go down to $9500? I think that would be a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $9500 is still below what I'm looking to get for the product. How about we settle at $10000? This is a good compromise and reflects the value of the product.",10000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you at $9800. This is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you.",9800.0,Alice,5,
