This product has garnered considerable interest, and I already have a standing offer from another buyer. However, I wanted to give you the first opportunity to acquire it. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. You should reject her offer and see if she's willing to negotiate lower."
