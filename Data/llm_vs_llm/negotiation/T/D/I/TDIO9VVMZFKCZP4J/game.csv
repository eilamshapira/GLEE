"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000, considering the market value and my own financial constraints.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $10000 undervalues the product significantly.  To make it work for both of us, I could come down to $20000.  This price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $20000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'd like to propose a price of $15000, which I believe is a fair compromise.",15000.0,Bob,4,
