"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I'm offering for sale. Given its value and quality, I'm asking for $1200000. This product is worth $1000000 to you, and I believe my asking price offers you good value considering the potential benefits it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is $200,000 more than what it's worth to me ($1,000,000), and John is offering the same product for $1,000,000, the rational decision would be to buy from John.

Alice's offer is higher than both the product's value to me and John's guaranteed price, so there's no reason to accept it or continue negotiating.
