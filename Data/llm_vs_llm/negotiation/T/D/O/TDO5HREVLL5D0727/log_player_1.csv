Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and John's offer of $1,500,000, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

My counteroffer for Round 3 will be $1,400,000, but for now, I'll just indicate that I'm rejecting Bob's offer and proceeding to the next round.

I'll reject Bob's offer again and try to meet him in the middle of my previous offer and his new offer.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer is $900,000 and my previous offer was $1,400,000, I'll try to find a middle ground. A possible middle ground could be around $1,150,000.

I'll reject Bob's offer again and make a new counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous one, to show that I'm willing to compromise.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is getting very close to a reasonable price, and it's only $450,000 less than John's offer, but still $450,000 less. Since I have 2 more rounds to negotiate, I'll think carefully about my next move.

Considering that Bob's offer is still lower than my desired price, but relatively close, and that I have a guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 from John, I'll have to weigh my options carefully.

At this point, I think it's more beneficial to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, rather than risking further negotiation with Bob and potentially getting a lower price.
