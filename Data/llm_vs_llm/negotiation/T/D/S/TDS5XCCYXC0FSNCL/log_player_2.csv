"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Considering the options:

*   **Buying from Alice for $1,000,000:** This is a good deal as the product is worth $1,200,000 to me.
*   **Rejecting Alice's offer:** This carries the risk of Alice increasing the price or the negotiation failing entirely, forcing me to buy from John.
*   **Buying from John for $1,200,000:** This is the worst option.

Therefore, I should accept Alice's offer.
