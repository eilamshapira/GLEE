"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Looking at this situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000
2. John is also selling the same product for $1,000,000
3. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me

Since Alice's initial offer is at the maximum value I would pay ($1,000,000), there's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. If I reject and make a counteroffer, I might be able to purchase it for less than $1,000,000. If negotiations fail, I can always buy from John at the same price Alice is currently offering.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice that allows room for negotiation while still representing a substantial discount from her initial price.
