"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'd like to offer it to you for a competitive price. Take advantage of this opportunity to own it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Looking at the information provided:

1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $150
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $100

Since Alice's offer ($150) exceeds both the product's value to me ($100) and John's alternative price ($100), the economically rational choice is to buy from John instead.
