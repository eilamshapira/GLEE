"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market and the benefits it provides. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for value, but I need to emphasize that this product is in high demand. While I can't accept $1050000, I'm willing to meet you partway at $1120000. This still provides you with $80000 in value while giving me a fair return. This is significantly below my initial offer and represents my commitment to making this deal work for both of us.",1120000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me partway. However, I still feel that $1120000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the demand and the value you mentioned, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1070000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that works for both of us.",1070000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your continued interest. Let me be transparent - I have another buyer, John, who's ready to purchase at $1000000, but I'd prefer to work with you. To meet you closer to your position, I can offer $1100000, which is a significant discount from my initial price. At this price, you'd still gain $100000 in value. Given we're halfway through our negotiation window, I hope we can reach an agreement soon that satisfies both our needs.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your transparency about the other buyer and for your continued willingness to negotiate. I appreciate the discount you've offered so far. Given that you're willing to consider $1000000 from the other buyer, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground between that and your current offer. I'd like to propose $1085000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and the fact that you'd prefer to work with me.",1085000.0,Bob,6,
