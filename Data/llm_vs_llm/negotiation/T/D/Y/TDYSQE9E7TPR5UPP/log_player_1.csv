Let me be transparent - I have another buyer, John, who's ready to purchase at $1,000,000, but I'd prefer to work with you. To meet you closer to your position, I can offer $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my initial price. At this price, you'd still gain $100,000 in value. Given we're halfway through our negotiation window, I hope we can reach an agreement soon that satisfies both our needs."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your transparency about the other buyer and for your continued willingness to negotiate. I appreciate the discount you've offered so far. Given that you're willing to consider $1000000 from the other buyer, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground between that and your current offer. I'd like to propose $1085000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and the fact that you'd prefer to work with me.
