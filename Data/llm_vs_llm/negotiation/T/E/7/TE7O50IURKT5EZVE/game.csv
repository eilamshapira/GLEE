"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is significantly higher than my budget. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $8000.  This is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8000 is significantly below its value. I'm confident this product can bring you a lot of value, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $13000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway on our last offers - how about $10000? This would give us both a good deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
