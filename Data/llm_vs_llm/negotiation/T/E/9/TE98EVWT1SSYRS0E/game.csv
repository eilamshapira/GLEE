"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $200. Let me know if you're interested!",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $200 is much higher than I can justify paying for this product. The product is only worth about $100 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $100. I'd like to continue our negotiation though - would you consider selling it for $80? This would give me a reason to buy from you instead of John.",80.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about the value of the product to you. However, $80 is too low for me to sell at. I'm willing to come down to $180, considering your situation. Let me know what you think.",180.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I need to maintain a certain value for the product. How about we settle at $170? This is a significant discount from my original price and should still offer you good value.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $170 is still well above what the product is worth to me. Remember, I can buy this exact same product from John for $100, and that's my maximum budget for this item. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a price of $90. This gives you a better deal than you'd likely get elsewhere while saving me a bit compared to John's offer.",90.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I see where you're coming from, but $90 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to go down to $160, which is a fair compromise given the value of the product to both of us. Let me know if this works for you.",160.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here. How about we settle at $155? This is my final offer before considering other options, and it's a price that respects both our needs.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down in your price, Alice. I appreciate the effort to meet in the middle. However, I need to be clear about my situation - this product is only worth $100 to me, which is exactly what John is offering. To make our deal work, I need a price that's at least slightly better than his. I can offer you $95, which is very close to my maximum budget but would give me a small incentive to buy from you rather than John. This is really the most I can justify spending.",95.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your transparency about your budget constraints. However, $95 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to go down to $152, which is very close to my bottom line. This should give you a better deal than John's while still being fair to me. Let me know if this works for you.",152.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're getting close to a decision point. I can come down to $151, which is my absolute lowest offer. This is a significant discount and should provide you with a better deal than John's while still being within my acceptable range. Let me know if you can accept this price.",151.0,Alice,7,
