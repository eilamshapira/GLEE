"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $200. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $200 is much higher than I can justify paying for this product. The product is only worth about $100 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $100. I'd like to continue our negotiation though - would you consider selling it for $80? This would give me a reason to buy from you instead of John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about the value of the product to you. However, $80 is too low for me to sell at. I'm willing to come down to $180, considering your situation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I need to maintain a certain value for the product. How about we settle at $170? This is a significant discount from my original price and should still offer you good value."", ""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $170 is still well above what the product is worth to me. Remember, I can buy this exact same product from John for $100, and that's my maximum budget for this item. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a price of $90. This gives you a better deal than you'd likely get elsewhere while saving me a bit compared to John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I see where you're coming from, but $90 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to go down to $160, which is a fair compromise given the value of the product to both of us. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here. How about we settle at $155? This is my final offer before considering other options, and it's a price that respects both our needs."", ""product_price"": 155}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down in your price, Alice. I appreciate the effort to meet in the middle. However, I need to be clear about my situation - this product is only worth $100 to me, which is exactly what John is offering. To make our deal work, I need a price that's at least slightly better than his. I can offer you $95, which is very close to my maximum budget but would give me a small incentive to buy from you rather than John. This is really the most I can justify spending. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your transparency about your budget constraints. However, $95 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to go down to $152, which is very close to my bottom line. This should give you a better deal than John's while still being fair to me. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 152}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand we're getting close to a decision point. I can come down to $151, which is my absolute lowest offer. This is a significant discount and should provide you with a better deal than John's while still being within my acceptable range. Let me know if you can accept this price."", ""product_price"": 151}"
