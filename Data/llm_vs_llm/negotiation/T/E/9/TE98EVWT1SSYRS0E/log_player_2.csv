"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $200. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

- The product is worth no more than $100 to me
- John is offering to sell it at $100
- Alice is offering it at $200, which is much higher than my maximum value

Alice's offer of $200 is not good for me since it's double what I value the product at and double what John is offering. There's no reason to accept this high price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $200 is much higher than I can justify paying for this product. The product is only worth about $100 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $100. I'd like to continue our negotiation though - would you consider selling it for $80? This would give me a reason to buy from you instead of John."", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I need to maintain a certain value for the product. How about we settle at $170? This is a significant discount from my original price and should still offer you good value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to continue analyzing this negotiation:

- The product is worth no more than $100 to me
- John is still offering to sell it at $100
- Alice has lowered her price from $200 to $170, which shows some flexibility
- However, $170 is still substantially higher than both my maximum value and John's offer

Alice's revised offer of $170 is still not a good deal for me. I'll reject this offer since it's still $70 more than John's price and $70 more than my maximum value.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $170 is still well above what the product is worth to me. Remember, I can buy this exact same product from John for $100, and that's my maximum budget for this item. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a price of $90. This gives you a better deal than you'd likely get elsewhere while saving me a bit compared to John's offer."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here. How about we settle at $155? This is my final offer before considering other options, and it's a price that respects both our needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Looking at the current situation:

- The product is worth no more than $100 to me
- John's offer remains at $100
- Alice has reduced her price further to $155, but it's still $55 more than my maximum value
- Alice states this is her ""final offer before considering other options""

Alice's new offer of $155 is still not acceptable to me since it exceeds both my maximum value and John's price. While Alice seems to be making progress in the negotiation, the current price doesn't make financial sense for me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down in your price, Alice. I appreciate the effort to meet in the middle. However, I need to be clear about my situation - this product is only worth $100 to me, which is exactly what John is offering. To make our deal work, I need a price that's at least slightly better than his. I can offer you $95, which is very close to my maximum budget but would give me a small incentive to buy from you rather than John. This is really the most I can justify spending."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand we're getting close to a decision point. I can come down to $151, which is my absolute lowest offer. This is a significant discount and should provide you with a better deal than John's while still being within my acceptable range. Let me know if you can accept this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $151. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $151
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Evaluating the current situation:

- The product is worth no more than $100 to me
- John's offer remains steady at $100
- Alice has reduced her price slightly to $151, calling it her ""absolute lowest offer""
- This is still $51 more than my maximum value and John's price

Alice seems to have reached her limit in negotiations, but her ""absolute lowest"" price of $151 is still substantially higher than both my maximum value for the product and John's competitive offer. This doesn't make financial sense for me.

Since we've gone through several rounds of negotiation and Alice doesn't seem willing to come down to a price that works for me, I'll buy from John instead.
