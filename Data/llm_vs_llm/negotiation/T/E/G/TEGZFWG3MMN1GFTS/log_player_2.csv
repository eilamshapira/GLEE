"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $1600000. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Based on the information provided:

1. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering the product for $1,600,000
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer ($1,600,000) exceeds the maximum value the product has to me ($1,200,000), and it's also higher than John's offer ($1,200,000).

The rational decision is to buy from John at the lower price that matches the product's maximum value to me.
