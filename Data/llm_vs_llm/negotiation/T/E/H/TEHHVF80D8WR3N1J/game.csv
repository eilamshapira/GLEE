"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, $15000 is actually the same price I can get it from another seller, John. Since I'm looking to save some money, I'd like to counter with $11000. This gives you a $1000 profit over your cost and provides me with some savings compared to my alternative option. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $13000. That's definitely a step in the right direction. However, I'm still looking to get a better deal than that. I'm willing to raise my offer to $11800. This gives you an $1800 profit margin above your cost while still providing me with significant savings compared to John's price. I think this is a fair compromise that works well for both of us. What do you say?",11800.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your revised offer. However, considering the unique features and value of this product, I believe a price of $12500 better reflects its worth. I'd be willing to settle at that price—let me know if that works for you.",12500.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued negotiation. I understand you're looking for the best deal possible. Given our previous discussion and the quality of this product, I'm willing to come a bit closer to your range. How does $12300 sound? I believe this price is a fair compromise that respects both the unique value of the product and your budget considerations. Let me know if this works for you.",12300.0,Alice,5,

"Thanks for coming down to $12300, Alice. I can see we're getting closer to an agreement. I'd like to meet you in the middle from our last positions. I'm offering $12000 for the product. This still gives you a solid $2000 profit margin while saving me $3000 compared to John's offer. I think this is a fair price that benefits us both. Do we have a deal?",12000.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to reach a deal. Given our previous discussions on the product’s value, I can meet you almost in the middle. How does $12150 sound? I believe this small adjustment better reflects the product’s worth while still offering you a solid deal.",12150.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I know we're close to a deal, and in the interest of finalizing, I'm willing to make a final adjustment. I can offer the product at $12100.
