"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm asking for $2300000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, considering the significant value it holds.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. This product is valuable, but the market is competitive.  I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $1100000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is substantial. I've factored in market conditions and I'm willing to come down to $2000000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that price is still too high for me. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but only at a price that makes sense for both of us. Would you consider $1300000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's close this deal at $1750000. This represents a considerable compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's inherent worth.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the movement, but we're still a fair bit apart. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1400000 to try and find a middle ground. What do you say?",1400000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up. To show you I'm serious about getting this done, I'll come down to $1600000. This is my final offer. It reflects the true value of this product. ",1600000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that.  However,  I can't justify going above $1450000. If you can meet me there, we have a deal.",1450000.0,Bob,8,
