"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1800000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1800000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  Given the product's potential, I'm willing to pay $1350000.  I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1350000 is a respectable offer, the value this product represents is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand your perspective, $1600000 is still above my preferred price point. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1450000.  This shows my commitment to finding a solution, but it's also the highest I can go.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
