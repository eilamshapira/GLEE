"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200. Let me know if you'd like to take it at this price!",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $40 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",40.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $40 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $180 for the product. Let me know if this works for you!",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $180, but it's still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle between my previous offer and your current offer. I'll give you $60 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd consider.",60.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to find a middle ground, but $60 is still not feasible for me. Let's try to meet closer to the middle. How about $150? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $150. However, it's still above my budget. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to stretch a bit and offer $70 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",70.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, but $70 is still too low for me. Let's try to find a fair price. I'm willing to go down to $130. This is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you.",130.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your final offer of $130, but it's still above what I'm willing to pay. Considering your last message, I'm going to make one more attempt to find a mutually agreeable price. I'll offer $75 for the product. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",75.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but $75 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $125, which is very close to my bottom line. This is my final offer before I consider selling to someone else. Let me know if you can meet at this price.",125.0,Alice,9,
