"Hi Alice, while I appreciate the quality of the product, the price of $12500 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $6000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but I'm afraid I can't accept $6000 as that's below my cost. The product has exceptional value, and while I can be flexible on my initial price, I cannot go below $9500. This is already a significant reduction from my original offer and represents excellent value for the quality you'll receive. Would this work for you?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $9500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $7000. This is the best I can do within my budget. Let me know if this works for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
