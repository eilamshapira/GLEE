Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but I'm afraid I can't accept $6000 as that's below my cost. The product has exceptional value, and while I can be flexible on my initial price, I cannot go below $9500. This is already a significant reduction from my original offer and represents excellent value for the quality you'll receive. Would this work for you?
