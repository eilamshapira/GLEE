"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $120
2. John's price is also $120
3. The product is worth no more than $120 to me
4. Both offers are at the maximum amount I'm willing to pay

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($120), and this is at my maximum acceptable price, there's no advantage in choosing one over the other. However, since Alice made the offer first, it would be more courteous to accept her offer rather than reject it to buy from John for the same price.
