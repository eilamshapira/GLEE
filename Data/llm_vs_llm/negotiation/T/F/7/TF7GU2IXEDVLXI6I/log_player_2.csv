"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I hope you're doing well. I'm offering this unique product for $20000. I believe it's an excellent investment for someone who truly appreciates its value. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to discuss further details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to analyze this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $20,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000. Since I know I can buy the same product from John for exactly $8,000, and that's the maximum it's worth to me anyway, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer or continue negotiating.
