Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $11,000 is only slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and we're still early in the negotiation (Round 2 of 10). Given that the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, there's room for a better deal.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's incremental increase of only $500 from his previous offer suggests he's negotiating very conservatively. However, we still have 6 rounds left, and there's a significant gap between his offer and the product's value to him ($15,000). I'll reject this offer to continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll reduce my previous offer more substantially to show flexibility while still maintaining a good profit margin. Let's try to meet closer to the middle between his last offer ($11,500) and my previous offer ($13,500).

We still have 4 rounds left, and there's still a significant gap between his offer and the product's value to him. Given that Bob keeps responding with counteroffers, I believe there's still room for a better deal.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a more significant reduction in my asking price to show good faith and try to accelerate the negotiation, as we're now in Round 7 of 10. I'll move closer to Bob's last offer while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
