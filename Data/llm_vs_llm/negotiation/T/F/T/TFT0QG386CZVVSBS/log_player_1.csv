Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make an offer to Bob for my product. Given that the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price, I should offer Bob a higher price to maximize my earnings.

I'll set the price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value, but not so high that it would be immediately rejected. Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll aim for a substantial premium above my reservation price.
