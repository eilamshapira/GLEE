"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's price ($1,500,000), and I know I can only value the product up to $1,500,000, I should reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price with Alice. There's no risk in trying to get a better deal since I can always fall back to John's offer of $1,500,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low that it would be considered unreasonable. Since my maximum value is $1,500,000, I'll start at around 60% of that value.

{""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","This is a good development - Alice has reduced her price significantly from $1,500,000 to $1,200,000, which is $300,000 less than John's price. However, since Alice has shown willingness to negotiate and there are still several rounds left, I'll try one more counter to see if I can get an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down to $1,200,000 from $1,500,000, and rejected my initial offer of $900,000, I'll try to meet closer to the middle. I'll offer $1,050,000, which is halfway between my last offer and her current offer.
