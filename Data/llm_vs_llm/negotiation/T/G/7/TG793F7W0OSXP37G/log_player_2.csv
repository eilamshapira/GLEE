"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to negotiate a better price with Alice since her offer of $160 is actually more than the product is worth to me (which is no more than $150). I also have the option to buy from John at $150, which sets my maximum price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives us room to negotiate.

{""product_price"": $120}"

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has reduced her price to $145, which is less than both her initial offer and John's price of $150. Since the product is worth up to $150 to me, and Alice's offer is below that threshold, I should accept this offer to save $5 compared to buying from John.
