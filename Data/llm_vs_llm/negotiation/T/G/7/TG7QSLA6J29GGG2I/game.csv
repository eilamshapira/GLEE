"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1200000 exceeds my budget for this product. The product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I actually have another seller (John) who can provide it at exactly that price. I'd like to do business with you instead if possible. I can offer you $800000 for the product, which would save me some money while still giving you a reasonable profit. Would you consider this offer?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your candid response about your budget and alternative options. Since you mentioned the product is worth up to $1000000 to you, and you have another seller at that price, I can offer you a better deal at $950000. This gives you a $50000 savings compared to your other option, while still reflecting the true value of the product. Would this work for you?",950000.0,Alice,3,
