"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $1,200,000, which reflects its exceptional quality and market value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1200000 exceeds my budget for this product. The product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I actually have another seller (John) who can provide it at exactly that price. I'd like to do business with you instead if possible. I can offer you $800000 for the product, which would save me some money while still giving you a reasonable profit. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer in the next round. Bob mentioned the product is worth up to $1,000,000 to him, and he revealed he has another seller at that price. Since my minimum acceptable price is $800,000, there's room for negotiation between $800,000 and $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your candid response about your budget and alternative options. Since you mentioned the product is worth up to $1,000,000 to you, and you have another seller at that price, I can offer you a better deal at $950,000. This gives you a $50,000 savings compared to your other option, while still reflecting the true value of the product. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 950000}"
