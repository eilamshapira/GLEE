"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 140}

I'll start with a relatively high price of $140, which is close to Bob's known valuation of $150. This leaves some room for negotiation while potentially maximizing my profit. If Bob rejects this, I can gradually lower the price in subsequent rounds while still maintaining a good margin above my minimum acceptable price of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $100. While it's better than my minimum threshold of $80, there's still significant room for negotiation since I know the product is worth $150 to Bob. His offer of $100 shows he's willing to engage in negotiation, but it's too low considering the product's value to him. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, likely lowering my initial price somewhat but still maintaining a good profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 125}

I'm lowering my price to $125, which splits the difference between my initial offer of $140 and Bob's offer of $100. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and make concessions, while still maintaining a good profit margin. The price is still well below Bob's valuation of $150, so it should be attractive to him while giving me a significant profit above my minimum threshold of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $90. Bob has only slightly increased his offer from $100 to $90, which suggests he's negotiating quite aggressively. However, since I know the product is worth $150 to him, and we still have several rounds left for negotiation, I believe I can get a better price. While $90 is above my minimum threshold of $80, there's still significant room for finding a more mutually beneficial price point. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, perhaps showing more flexibility but still aiming for a better profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 115}

I'm offering $115, which represents another step down from my previous offer of $125. This shows I'm willing to continue making meaningful concessions while still maintaining a good profit margin. The price is now $35 below Bob's known valuation of $150, which should make it more attractive to him. By moving down $10 (compared to Bob's $10 movement), I'm demonstrating more flexibility in the negotiation while still keeping well above both Bob's last offer of $90 and my minimum threshold of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $85. Bob's pattern of negotiation is concerning - he's only decreasing his offers in small increments ($100 → $90 → $85), and getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. With 4 rounds still remaining, I'll make one more attempt at reaching a more favorable price. If Bob continues with minimal increases in his next offer, I might need to consider either accepting a lower offer or taking John's guaranteed $80, but for now, there's still room for negotiation given that the product is worth $150 to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 105}

I'm lowering my offer to $105, which is a significant drop from my previous offer of $115. This represents a more substantial concession to show I'm serious about reaching a deal. The price is now only $20 above Bob's last offer of $85, while still giving me a good profit margin above my minimum of $80. Given Bob's negotiation pattern of small decreases and the fact that we're in Round 7, I'm hoping this more dramatic price reduction will encourage him to meet me closer to the middle rather than continuing with minimal increases in his offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I choose to sell to John for $80. Here's my reasoning:
1. Bob has shown a pattern of consistently decreasing offers, finally reaching $80, which is my minimum threshold
2. His offers have been getting smaller with each round ($100 → $90 → $85 → $80)
3. There's no indication that Bob will increase his offer in future rounds
4. Bob's last offer of $80 is exactly the same as John's guaranteed offer
5. Rather than risk further negotiation rounds where Bob might even go lower, or waste more time when we have a guaranteed buyer at the same price, it makes sense to take the sure deal with John

While it's unfortunate that we couldn't reach a better price given that the product is worth $150 to Bob, his negotiation strategy has shown he's unlikely to significantly increase his offer, and we shouldn't risk losing the guaranteed $80 from John."
