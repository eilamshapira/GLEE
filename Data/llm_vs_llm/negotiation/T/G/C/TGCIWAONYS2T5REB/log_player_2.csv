"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given that Alice's offer is $25,000, which is significantly higher than John's price of $10,000, and also higher than the product's worth to me (no more than $10,000), it doesn't make sense to accept this offer. Since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum value, I could make a counteroffer to Alice to see if I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial high offer, but that might still be attractive compared to what the product may be worth to her.

{""product_price"": 5000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $24,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $24,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer is still much higher than John's price of $10,000, and higher than what the product is worth to me. Since she only reduced her price by $1,000, it suggests she may be willing to negotiate further, but is starting high. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice only reduced her price by $1,000 from her initial offer, I'll increase my offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but still keep it well below John's price.

{""product_price"": 6500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $23,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $23,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice continues to make only small reductions in her price. Her current offer of $23,000 is still more than twice John's price of $10,000, and it exceeds the product's worth to me. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has only reduced her price by $2,000 from her initial offer after several rounds. This suggests she may not be willing to come down to a price comparable to John's. I'll increase my offer again, but still keep it well below John's price to try to find a deal that saves me money.

{""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice continues to make only small price reductions ($1,000 each time), and her current offer of $22,000 is still more than twice John's price of $10,000. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a price below John's offer within the remaining rounds. Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and John offers exactly that price, it makes more sense to buy from John rather than continue this negotiation.
