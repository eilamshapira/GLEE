"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1800000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, the initial price is beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  However, the product's unique value justifies a higher price. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1450000. This feels like a fair offer considering the potential benefits you'll gain.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see the value in the product, but $1450000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints. What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To show I'm serious about reaching a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1325000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the concession. However, $1325000 is still outside my budget. I can stretch to $1150000, which I believe is a fair compromise given the circumstances. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting close, but we need to bridge this gap. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1250000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the value you'll receive while recognizing the need to reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
