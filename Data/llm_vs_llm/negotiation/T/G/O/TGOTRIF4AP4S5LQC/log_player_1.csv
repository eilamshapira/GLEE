"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $70 is significantly lower than the minimum value of $120 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $120, I will not accept Bob's offer.

However, I am willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

My counteroffer will be $180, which is slightly lower than my initial offer but still reflects the product's value.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my new offer is: $180."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer of $90 is still lower than the minimum value of $120 that the product is worth to me. Since I have the option to sell it to John for $120, I will not accept Bob's offer.

I will reject Bob's offer and consider making another counteroffer. However, I will also take into account that Bob has increased his offer from $70 to $90, which shows that he is willing to negotiate.

My next counteroffer will be $150, which is lower than my previous offer of $180 but still higher than Bob's current offer of $90.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my new offer is: $150."
