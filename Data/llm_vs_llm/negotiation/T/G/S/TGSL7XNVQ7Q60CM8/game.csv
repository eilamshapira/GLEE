"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality of the product, $14500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm happy to offer $13000 for it.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot go that low. The product's quality and market value justify a higher price. I can reduce my initial asking price to $14000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to me.  Let's try to make this work.",13500.0,Bob,4,
