Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $14,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality of the product, $14500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm happy to offer $13000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since $13,000 is too low considering Bob's willingness to pay is $15,000, and it's not much better than John's guaranteed offer of $12,000. There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot go that low. The product's quality and market value justify a higher price. I can reduce my initial asking price to $14,000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to me.  Let's try to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $13,500. This is a good compromise as it's significantly better than John's guaranteed offer of $12,000, and while we might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk of Bob walking away. The $13,500 offer provides a reasonable profit margin above my minimum price of $12,000."
