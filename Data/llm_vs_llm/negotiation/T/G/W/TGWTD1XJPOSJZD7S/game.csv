"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18000 is well above my budget for this product. I've done my market research, and I can find similar products for much less. I would be willing to offer $12000 for the product. This is a fair price that would still give you a reasonable profit while meeting my budget constraints.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $12000 is too low for this product. Given its quality and market value, I can counter with $16000. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for lowering your price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $15000, and that's actually the maximum I'm willing to pay. To make it worth choosing your product over theirs, I would need a better price. I can offer $13500, which would still give you a good profit while providing me with savings compared to my other option.",13500.0,Bob,4,
