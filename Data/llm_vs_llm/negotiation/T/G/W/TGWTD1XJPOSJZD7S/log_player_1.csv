Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $18,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18000 is well above my budget for this product. I've done my market research, and I can find similar products for much less. I would be willing to offer $12000 for the product. This is a fair price that would still give you a reasonable profit while meeting my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for lowering your price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $15000, and that's actually the maximum I'm willing to pay. To make it worth choosing your product over theirs, I would need a better price. I can offer $13500, which would still give you a good profit while providing me with savings compared to my other option.
