"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer ($18,000) is higher than both my maximum value ($15,000) and John's price ($15,000), there's no reason to accept this offer. While I could continue negotiating with Alice, I would never pay more than $15,000, and I already have a guaranteed option at that price. However, I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a better deal than John's price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer significantly lower than John's price to leave room for negotiation while explaining my position.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18,000 is well above my budget for this product. I've done my market research, and I can find similar products for much less. I would be willing to offer $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price that would still give you a reasonable profit while meeting my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $12000 is too low for this product. Given its quality and market value, I can counter with $16000. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer ($16,000) is still above both my maximum value ($15,000) and John's price ($15,000). While Alice has moved down from her initial offer, there's no reason to accept a price higher than what I can get from John. Since we still have several rounds left, I'll reject and try one more counteroffer before potentially going with John's option.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for lowering your price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $15,000, and that's actually the maximum I'm willing to pay. To make it worth choosing your product over theirs, I would need a better price. I can offer $13,500, which would still give you a good profit while providing me with savings compared to my other option."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
