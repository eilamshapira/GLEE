"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think of my initial offer.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $120 is too high for me. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $80. But I'd like to work with you - would you consider selling it for $65? This would be a fair price that works for both of us.",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $120 might be too high, but I'm afraid $65 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to offer the product to you for $100, which is a more reasonable price considering its value. Let me know if this works for you.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $100 is still more than I can justify spending. I want to be transparent - I have a firm offer from another seller for $80. I'd like to do business with you instead, and I can offer $70. This would save me some money while still giving you a fair price for the product.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your updated offer. I understand you have another option for $80, but I'm willing to work with you to find a better price. I can offer the product to you for $90, which is a more significant discount than my previous offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",90.0,Alice,5,
