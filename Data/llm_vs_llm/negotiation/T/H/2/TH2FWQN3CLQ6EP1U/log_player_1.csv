Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $120 is too high for me. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $80. But I'd like to work with you - would you consider selling it for $65? This would be a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $65 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. 

My counteroffer: $100 

Let's see how Bob responds to this new offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $120 might be too high, but I'm afraid $65 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to offer the product to you for $100, which is a more reasonable price considering its value. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $100 is still more than I can justify spending. I want to be transparent - I have a firm offer from another seller for $80. I'd like to do business with you instead, and I can offer $70. This would save me some money while still giving you a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I appreciate Bob's transparency, but $70 is still below my desired price. Since I have a guaranteed offer of $80 from John, I'm not willing to go that low. I'll try to make another counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle.

My next counteroffer will be $90. This is a more significant concession on my part, and I hope Bob will consider it.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your updated offer. I understand you have another option for $80, but I'm willing to work with you to find a better price.
