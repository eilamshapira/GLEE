"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think of my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: The initial offer of $120 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $80 and higher than John's guaranteed price of $80. It's logical to reject this offer and make a counteroffer to Alice. Since I can always fall back on John's offer of $80, there's no risk in continuing to negotiate with Alice to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $120 is too high for me. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $80. But I'd like to work with you - would you consider selling it for $65? This would be a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 65}

Reasoning: I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly below my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80) to leave room for negotiation. By mentioning the alternative price of $80, I'm letting Alice know that I have other options and establishing that as a ceiling for our negotiations. Starting at $65 gives room for potential back-and-forth while still potentially allowing me to save money compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $120 might be too high, but I'm afraid $65 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to offer the product to you for $100, which is a more reasonable price considering its value. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: Alice has reduced her price from $120 to $100, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but $100 is still above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). Since I have the guaranteed option to buy from John at $80, there's no reason to accept a price higher than that. I should continue negotiating with Alice to try to get a better price, knowing I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $100 is still more than I can justify spending. I want to be transparent - I have a firm offer from another seller for $80. I'd like to do business with you instead, and I can offer $70. This would save me some money while still giving you a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 70}

Reasoning: I've increased my offer slightly from $65 to $70, showing willingness to negotiate while still keeping well below my maximum value. By explicitly mentioning the competing offer of $80, I'm establishing a clear ceiling for negotiations and giving Alice a reason to consider a lower price. The $70 offer gives Alice room to counter while still potentially giving me savings compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your updated offer. I understand you have another option for $80, but I'm willing to work with you to find a better price. I can offer the product to you for $90, which is a more significant discount than my previous offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Reasoning: At this point, the negotiation pattern shows that Alice is unlikely to go below $80. She started at $120, then $100, and now $90, but still remains above John's price of $80. Given that:
1. Alice's current offer ($90) is still above John's price ($80)
2. The rate of price reduction is slowing down
3. Further negotiation rounds might not yield a price below $80
4. $80 is already my maximum value for the product

It makes the most sense to end the negotiation and take John's guaranteed offer of $80. There's no reason to pay more than $80 when I have that as a guaranteed option, and Alice hasn't shown willingness to go below that price."
