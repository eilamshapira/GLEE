Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me make my initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $100 to him and $80 to me, I'll start with a high price to leave room for negotiation while trying to maximize my profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $70 is below both my minimum value ($80) and John's guaranteed offer ($80), it would not be rational to accept it. Furthermore, since I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $80, there's no reason to accept anything less. 

In this case, I can either try another counteroffer to Bob or take John's guaranteed $80. Since Bob's first offer was significantly low ($70), suggesting he might not be willing to pay a price that would be better than John's offer, the safest choice is to sell to John.
