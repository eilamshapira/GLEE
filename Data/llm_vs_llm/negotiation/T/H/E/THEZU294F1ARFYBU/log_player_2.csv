"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I should choose the option that gives me the best value. Let me analyze:

1. Alice's offer: $1,400,000
2. John's price: $800,000
3. My maximum value for the product: $800,000

Since Alice's offer ($1,400,000) is significantly higher than both:
- John's price ($800,000)
- My maximum value for the product ($800,000)

It would be unwise to accept Alice's offer as I would be paying $600,000 more than the product is worth to me. The best option is to buy from John at $800,000.
