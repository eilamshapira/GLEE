Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd love! I'm willing to sell it to you for $200."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer! I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Okay, I've received Bob's counteroffer of $120. That's below what the product is worth to me, and I can sell it to John for $150.

Therefore, my decision is:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
