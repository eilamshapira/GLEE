"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit above what I'm willing to spend. I'm prepared to buy the product for $950000. Let me know if this works for you.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. I can't go as low as $950000, but I'm willing to lower my price to $1050000. This still leaves me with a good profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1050000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $975000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my financial limits. What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $975000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1012500. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1012500 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $990000. This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll need to consider other options. Let me know what you decide.",990000.0,Bob,6,
