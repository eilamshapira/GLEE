Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about the optimal price for Bob.

Given that:
1. The product is worth $150 to Bob
2. I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150
3. Bob can only accept or reject the offer

I can try to get more than $150 from Bob, but if I ask for too much, he'll reject it. Since the product is worth $150 to Bob, he won't pay more than that. And since I have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, there's no reason to offer it for less.

Therefore, I'll offer it at exactly $150, which is the maximum Bob might accept.
