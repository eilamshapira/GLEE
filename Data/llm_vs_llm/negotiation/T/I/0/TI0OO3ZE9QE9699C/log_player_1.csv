"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,000 is lower than the minimum value of $12,000 that the product is worth to me, and also lower than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

My counteroffer is: $14,500

So, the response is not one of the three options you specified, but rather a counteroffer. If I had to choose one of the options, it would be:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I will send Bob a counteroffer of $14,500. 

Formally, the answer is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 14500}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is still lower than the minimum value of $12,000 that the product is worth to me, and also lower than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

My counteroffer is: $13,500

So, the response is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 13500}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

My counteroffer is: $12,500

So, the response is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 12500}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 12500}"

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $11,000 is still lower than the minimum value of $12,000 that the product is worth to me, and also lower than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer. 

At this point, I have only 2 rounds left, and Bob's offers are not increasing significantly. Considering the risk of not selling the product to Bob, I think it's better to sell it to John for $12,000, which is a guaranteed deal.

So, the response is:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
