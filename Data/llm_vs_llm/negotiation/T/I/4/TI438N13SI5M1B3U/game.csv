"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its rarity and the significant value it holds, I'm starting the negotiation at $25000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $25000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only consider it at a significantly lower price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $4000.",4000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While $4000 is too low, I understand you're working with a budget. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we meet at $22000? This product truly is exceptional.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $22000 is still far beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer, but I need to stay within a reasonable range. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $5500.",5500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $5500 is still quite a distance from where I can reasonably sell this item, I am willing to come down a bit more. Let's try $19500. This is the lowest I can go for now while still ensuring a fair return.",19500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I see that you're willing to lower the price, but $19500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer again, but I need to stay within my budget. Considering John is offering the same product for $8000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6500.",6500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have budget constraints, but I am still confident that this product is worth more than what John is offering. Let's try to meet halfway. How about $17000?",17000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $17000 is still too high for me. Considering my budget and the alternative offer from John, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7000. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",7000.0,Bob,8,
