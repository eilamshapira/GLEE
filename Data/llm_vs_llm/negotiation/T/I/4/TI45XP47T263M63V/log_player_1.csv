Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its worth."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I'm interested in buying it, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as his offer of $1,000,000 is lower than my initial offer and also lower than the price I can get from John. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to negotiate further to get a better price. 

My counteroffer to Bob: $1,200,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, as it's the same price John is offering. If Bob is serious about buying the product, he should be willing to meet me at this price."

I understand that you think the initial price was steep, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer. However, I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'm reducing the price, but I still need to get a fair value for the product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
