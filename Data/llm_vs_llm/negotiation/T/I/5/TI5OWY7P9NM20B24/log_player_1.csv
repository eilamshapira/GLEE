(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

The offer of $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and it's even below John's guaranteed offer. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, lowering my initial price but still keeping it above $12,000."

Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below John's guaranteed offer of $12,000. Since we still have several rounds left and Bob has shown willingness to increase his offer, I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, but I'll lower my asking price to show flexibility in negotiation."
