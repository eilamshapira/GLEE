"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer as $16,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's alternative price ($12,000). There's no reason to accept a price that's $4,000 above my maximum value when I have a guaranteed option at $12,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 10000}

I'll offer $10,000 to Alice. Here's my reasoning:
1. The product is worth $12,000 to Alice
2. I know I have John's offer at $12,000 as a backup
3. By offering $10,000, I'm giving Alice a chance to make a profit but also trying to save money compared to John's price
4. This leaves room for negotiation if Alice counters, while still being a reasonable starting point that's not too low to be insulting"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer because $14,000 is still above both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000). While Alice has come down from her initial offer of $16,000, there's still no reason to accept a price that's $2,000 above what I can get from John. I'll continue negotiating to try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 11000}

I'll increase my offer to $11,000. Here's my reasoning:
1. My previous offer of $10,000 was rejected, so I'm showing willingness to negotiate by increasing the price
2. $11,000 would still give me $1,000 in savings compared to John's price
3. This would give Alice a $1,000 profit from her cost of $12,000
4. If Alice rejects this, I still have several rounds to negotiate, but I'm also prepared to go with John's offer if needed
5. By making smaller incremental increases, I'm signaling that I won't go much higher"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John now. Here's why:
1. Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above John's price of $12,000
2. Alice seems to be reducing her price very slowly (from $16,000 to $14,000 to $13,000)
3. Even if we continue negotiating, it's unlikely Alice will go below $12,000 since that's her cost
4. We've already gone through half of our negotiation rounds
5. There's no reason to pay more than $12,000 when we have a guaranteed option at that price
6. Time is valuable, and continuing the negotiation when we have a good alternative doesn't make sense

Therefore, I'll take John's offer of $12,000 now."
