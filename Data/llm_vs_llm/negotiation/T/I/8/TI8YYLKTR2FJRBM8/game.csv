"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. Considering the market value and my budget, I'm willing to pay $900000 for this product.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000, considering the product's exceptional quality and the value it can bring to you. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe this price is more in line with the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1050000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $975000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Splitting the difference is a good idea, but I was thinking we could meet closer to the middle of my previous offer. How about we do $1000000? This way, we're both making a concession, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
