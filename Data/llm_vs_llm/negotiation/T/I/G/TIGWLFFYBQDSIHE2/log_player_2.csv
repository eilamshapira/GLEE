"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer is the same price as John's ($10,000), and the product is worth only $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation to get a better price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice and $10,000 to me, I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation. I'll offer a price closer to Alice's cost but still giving her some profit.

{""product_price"": 8500}

This offer gives Alice a $500 profit while saving me $1,500 compared to buying from John. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has lowered her price by $500, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, since the product is worth $8,000 to her, there's still room for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and try another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has moved down from $10,000 to $9,500, showing some flexibility. I'll increase my previous offer but still try to get a good deal.

{""product_price"": 9000}

This offer gives Alice a $1,000 profit which is quite reasonable, while still saving me $1,000 compared to John's price. It also splits the difference between her last offer ($9,500) and my previous offer ($8,500), showing I'm willing to compromise."
