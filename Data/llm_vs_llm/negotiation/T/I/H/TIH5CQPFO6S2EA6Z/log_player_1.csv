Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob for the product.

Looking at the situation, I need to balance the risk of Bob rejecting my offer against maximizing my profit. Since I can always sell to John for $100 (my minimum acceptable amount), any price above $100 I can get from Bob would be beneficial.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll choose a price that gives me a good profit margin while still being potentially acceptable to Bob.
