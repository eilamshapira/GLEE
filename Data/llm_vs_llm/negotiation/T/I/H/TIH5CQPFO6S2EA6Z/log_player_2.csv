"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer ($150) is higher than both the product's worth to me ($100) and John's price ($100), it wouldn't make economic sense to accept Alice's offer. 

John's offer is equal to my maximum valuation ($100), and it's the best guaranteed price available. Therefore, the rational decision would be to buy from John.
