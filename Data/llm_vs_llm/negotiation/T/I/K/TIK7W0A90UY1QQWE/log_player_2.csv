"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd really be interested in. I'm offering it to you exclusively. What do you think of $10000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Based on the information provided, the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me (Bob), and Alice is offering it for $10,000. Since John is willing to sell the same product for $8,000, and this matches the maximum value I place on the product, the rational decision would be to buy from John.
