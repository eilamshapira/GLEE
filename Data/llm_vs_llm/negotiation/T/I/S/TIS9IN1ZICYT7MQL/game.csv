,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2000000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $500000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $500000 is far below the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1250000? This price still leaves room for you to profit, and it's closer to the value I see in this product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1250000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. This price reflects a serious commitment to acquiring the product while being mindful of my budget constraints.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800000 is still quite a bit below what I consider a fair price.  Let's try to find a compromise.  How about $1000000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit and still represent a good deal for you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
