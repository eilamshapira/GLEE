"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $2000000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. 

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,000,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $500000 is far below the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1250000? This price still leaves room for you to profit, and it's closer to the value I see in this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's new offer of $1,250,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to meet Alice halfway between her last offer and my previous counteroffer. Since Alice offered $1,250,000 and I previously offered $500,000, the midpoint would be $875,000. However, considering my maximum budget is $1,000,000, I'll make a counteroffer slightly below the midpoint to leave some room for further negotiation.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This price reflects a serious commitment to acquiring the product while being mindful of my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $800000 is still quite a bit below what I consider a fair price.  Let's try to find a compromise.  How about $1000000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit and still represent a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","This is an interesting turn of events. Alice's new offer of $1,000,000 is exactly the same price that John is offering, and it's also the maximum amount I'm willing to pay. Since I can get the same product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in continuing to negotiate with Alice.
