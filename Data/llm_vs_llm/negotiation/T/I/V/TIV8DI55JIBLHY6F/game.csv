"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $15000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $6000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $6000 is too low for me. Considering the value and the benefits it brings, how about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $14000.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14000 is still too high for me. I can go up to $7000, which is the highest I can offer while staying within my budget. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your improved offer. Let's try to find a number that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $13000. This is a significant reduction and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the reduction. However, $13000 is still outside my budget. I can stretch to $7500, but that's the absolute maximum I can do. Let me know if this works for you.",7500.0,Bob,6,
