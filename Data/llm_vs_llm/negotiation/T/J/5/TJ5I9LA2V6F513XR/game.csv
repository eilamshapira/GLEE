"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1200000. Let me know if this works for you.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that my initial price was a bit steep, but I believe the product is worth more than $1200000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to counteroffer at $1800000. If you're still interested, let me know and we can discuss further.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1800000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1300000. This is the highest I can go while still finding the deal worthwhile. Let me know if we can meet at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
