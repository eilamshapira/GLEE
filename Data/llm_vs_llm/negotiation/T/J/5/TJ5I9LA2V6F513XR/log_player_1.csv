Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1200000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly the minimum value the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for the same price, I don't see a benefit in accepting Bob's offer over selling to John, but I also don't want to lose the potential of getting a higher price from Bob. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that my initial price was a bit steep, but I believe the product is worth more than $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,800,000. If you're still interested, let me know and we can discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1800000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1300000. This is the highest I can go while still finding the deal worthwhile. Let me know if we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's new offer of $1,300,000 is higher than the minimum value I'm willing to accept ($1,200,000) and also higher than John's offer, I will accept Bob's offer. This way, I can earn more money than I would by selling to John.
