"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. I believe it would be a great asset to you.  I'm asking for $25000. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $8000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18000? ",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your counteroffer. How about $12000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  However, the value of this product is genuinely higher than what you're currently offering.  I could consider coming down to $15000, but that's my absolute lowest.  It's a fair offer considering its worth.",15000.0,Alice,5,
