Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a reasonable price to offer Bob for the product. The product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price if Bob declines.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I should set a price that's high enough to maximize my profit but not so high that Bob will immediately reject it. I'll aim for a significant premium above my minimum value.
