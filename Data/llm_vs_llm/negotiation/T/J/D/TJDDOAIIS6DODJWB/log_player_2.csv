"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that would be valuable for you. After careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $1800000. This is a premium product with excellent value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll analyze the situation:
1. Alice's offer: $1,800,000
2. My maximum value: $1,200,000
3. John's fixed price: $1,200,000

Alice's initial offer of $1,800,000 is significantly above both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000). Since Alice's offer is $600,000 more than what the product is worth to me, and also $600,000 more than John's price, it would be unwise to accept this offer.

While I could reject and make a counteroffer, I notice that Alice values the product at $1,500,000, which is already above my maximum value of $1,200,000. This suggests it might be difficult to negotiate down to a price that works for me.

Given that John's price matches my maximum value and is significantly lower than Alice's offer, the most rational decision is to buy from John.
