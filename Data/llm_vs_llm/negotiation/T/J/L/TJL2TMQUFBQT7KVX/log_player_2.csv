"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000), it would not be rational to accept her offer. The best option is to buy from John at $12,000, which matches my maximum value and saves me $8,000 compared to Alice's offer.
