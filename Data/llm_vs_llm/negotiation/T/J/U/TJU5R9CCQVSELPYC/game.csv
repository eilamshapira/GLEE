"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. While I see the value in this product, I'm only comfortable spending up to $1200000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your position, the product's value to us is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $1800000, which still represents a great deal for you considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think.",1800000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. Given the value it holds, I'm prepared to lower the price further to $1700000. This is a significant reduction from our initial offer and reflects our desire to work with you. What are your thoughts on this?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1700000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1400000?  This would be a good starting point for us to get closer to a deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I see that you're keen on finding a middle ground. While $1400000 is still below our minimum threshold, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1600000? This price reflects a significant compromise on our part and should be within the range of value you're looking for.",1600000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer

"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $1550000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1450000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
