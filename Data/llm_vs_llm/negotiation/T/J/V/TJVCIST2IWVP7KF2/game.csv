"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1400000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $1100000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1400000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still looking to get a fair price for the product. Considering your interest and the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1300000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth and is a reasonable compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but the gap is still a bit too wide for me. Would you consider $1150000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects both the product's value and our willingness to make a deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I've considered your latest offer of $1150000, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm offering $1250000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for understanding.  I'm getting closer to your price, but to be honest, $1250000 is really pushing my budget.  How about we settle right in the middle at $1200000? That feels like a win-win to me.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
