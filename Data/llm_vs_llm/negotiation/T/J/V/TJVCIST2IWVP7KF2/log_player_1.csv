Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1400000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $1100000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually beneficial price. Since Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000 and his current offer is $1,100,000, I'll try to meet him halfway. My next offer will be $1,300,000."

Bob's offer:

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since Bob's latest offer is $1,150,000 and he's willing to pay up to $1,500,000, I'll try to find a middle ground. My next offer will be $1,250,000, which is still below Bob's maximum willingness to pay but closer to my target price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for understanding.  I'm getting closer to your price, but to be honest, $1250000 is really pushing my budget.  How about we settle right in the middle at $1200000? That feels like a win-win to me.

Since Bob's latest offer of $1,200,000 matches the price I can get from selling to John, and I've been trying to negotiate a higher price with Bob, it seems that we've reached a mutually acceptable point. Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal without further negotiations, and the price is at the minimum I'm willing to accept."
