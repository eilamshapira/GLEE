"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm selling it for $250. This product is worth considerably more in the market, but I'm offering you a competitive price. Would you like to purchase it?",250.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $50 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but I'm afraid $50 is significantly below my cost for this item. The product is high quality and worth considerably more than that. I can come down to $210, which is already a substantial discount from my initial offer. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive.",210.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $210 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'd like to offer $130 for the product. This is the highest I'm comfortable going, considering I can also purchase it from John for $80.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your continued interest. However, I need to clarify something - you mentioned you could purchase it from John for $80, but I actually have confirmation that John values this product at $150. Given this information, I'm willing to offer you the product for $160, which is still a significant reduction from my previous offers and provides you with excellent value. This price is very close to your budget while still being fair to me as the seller.",160.0,Alice,5,
