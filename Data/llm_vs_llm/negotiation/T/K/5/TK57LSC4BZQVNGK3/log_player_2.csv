"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but I'm afraid $50 is significantly below my cost for this item. The product is high quality and worth considerably more than that. I can come down to $210, which is already a substantial discount from my initial offer. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your continued interest. However, I need to clarify something - you mentioned you could purchase it from John for $80, but I actually have confirmation that John values this product at $150. Given this information, I'm willing to offer you the product for $160, which is still a significant reduction from my previous offers and provides you with excellent value. This price is very close to your budget while still being fair to me as the seller. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160.
