"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for a special price. Would you like to buy it for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $150
3. John is willing to sell it for $100
4. My goal is to save money while getting the product

Since Alice's offer ($150) is higher than both:
- The value I place on the product ($100)
- John's price ($100)

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer. The logical choice would be to buy from John at $100.
