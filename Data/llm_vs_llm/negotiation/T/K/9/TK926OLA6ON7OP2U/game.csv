"Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I understand that the product has exceptional value, but $17000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay a reasonable price, considering the product's worth to me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $8000, which I believe is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must say that $8000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $14000, which is closer to the product's worth to me, yet still open to further negotiations.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down from the initial price. However, $14000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to me and the fact that I have alternative options, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $9500. This price reflects my serious interest in the product while also being mindful of my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12500 is still slightly above my budget. Considering the product's value to me and the alternative option I have, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10500.
