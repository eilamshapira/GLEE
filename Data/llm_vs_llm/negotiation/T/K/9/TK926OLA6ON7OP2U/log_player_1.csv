"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $17,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth and I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I understand that the product has exceptional value, but $17000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay a reasonable price, considering the product's worth to me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $8000, which I believe is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me ($15,000) and even lower than its worth to Bob ($10,000), I will reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must say that $8,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down from the initial price. However, $14000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to me and the fact that I have alternative options, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $9500. This price reflects my serious interest in the product while also being mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $9,500 is still lower than the product's worth to me ($15,000) and even lower than its worth to Bob ($10,000) is getting closer, I will reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer, trying to get closer to the product's worth to me or at least to its worth to Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I see that we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12500 is still slightly above my budget. Considering the product's value to me and the alternative option I have, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10500. This price is closer to my limit, and I believe it's a reasonable offer given the circumstances. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $10,500 is very close to the product's worth to Bob ($10,000), but still lower than the product's worth to me ($15,000), I will reject the offer. However, considering that we are already at Round 6 and Bob's offer is getting very close to his limit, my next counteroffer will be a crucial one, as I need to balance the need to get a good price with the risk of losing the sale to Bob."
