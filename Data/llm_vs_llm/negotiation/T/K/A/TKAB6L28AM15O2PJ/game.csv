"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $14000 is quite steep for what I'm looking for. The product is worth $10000 to you, and I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm looking for something more reasonable. I'm willing to offer $11500, which gives you a nice profit while still being within my budget constraints.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to make a deal. However, I believe the product's value is higher than what you've offered. Considering your interest in the product and its worth to you, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $13500, which is still a competitive price given its value to both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you lowering your offer to $13500. However, there's still quite a gap between our positions. The product might be valuable, but I need to consider my budget carefully. I'm willing to increase my offer to $12000, which represents a $2000 profit for you above the product's value to you. This seems like a fair middle ground that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, I still believe the product's value warrants a higher price. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer the product to you for $13000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, given its worth to both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $13000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can see we're getting closer to an agreement. I'd like to meet you in the middle at $12500. This represents a significant profit for you of $2500 above your cost, while still giving me some room in my budget. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits us both.",12500.0,Bob,6,
