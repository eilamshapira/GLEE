Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $14000 is quite steep for what I'm looking for. The product is worth $10000 to you, and I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm looking for something more reasonable. I'm willing to offer $11500, which gives you a nice profit while still being within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

However, I believe the product's value is higher than what you've offered. Considering your interest in the product and its worth to you, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $13,500, which is still a competitive price given its value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 13,500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you lowering your offer to $13500. However, there's still quite a gap between our positions. The product might be valuable, but I need to consider my budget carefully. I'm willing to increase my offer to $12000, which represents a $2000 profit for you above the product's value to you. This seems like a fair middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, I still believe the product's value warrants a higher price. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer the product to you for $13,000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, given its worth to both of us."", ""product_price"": 13,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $13000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can see we're getting closer to an agreement. I'd like to meet you in the middle at $12500. This represents a significant profit for you of $2500 above your cost, while still giving me some room in my budget. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500.
