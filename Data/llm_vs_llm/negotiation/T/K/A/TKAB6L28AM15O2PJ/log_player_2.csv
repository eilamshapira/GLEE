"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will bring significant value to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to let it go for a price that reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's offer of $14,000 is lower than John's $15,000, but it's still quite high considering the product is only worth $10,000 to Alice. Since we have multiple rounds of negotiation available, I should try to get a better price from Alice before accepting.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $14,000 is quite steep for what I'm looking for. The product is worth $10,000 to you, and I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm looking for something more reasonable. I'm willing to offer $11,500, which gives you a nice profit while still being within my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to make a deal. However, I believe the product's value is higher than what you've offered. Considering your interest in the product and its worth to you, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $13500, which is still a competitive price given its value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has dropped her price slightly to $13,500, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but there's still room for a better deal. Since we have several rounds left and John's offer of $15,000 remains as a backup option, I should continue negotiating with Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate you lowering your offer to $13,500. However, there's still quite a gap between our positions. The product might be valuable, but I need to consider my budget carefully. I'm willing to increase my offer to $12,000, which represents a $2,000 profit for you above the product's value to you. This seems like a fair middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, I still believe the product's value warrants a higher price. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer the product to you for $13000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, given its worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her price again to $13,000, showing that she's willing to continue negotiating. While this is definitely better than John's offer of $15,000, I still think we can reach a more favorable agreement since we're only halfway through our negotiation rounds.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $13,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can see we're getting closer to an agreement. I'd like to meet you in the middle at $12,500. This represents a significant profit for you of $2,500 above your cost, while still giving me some room in my budget. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
