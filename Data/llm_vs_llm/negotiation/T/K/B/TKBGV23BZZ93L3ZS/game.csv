"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I find the price a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. Would you consider this counteroffer?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't accept $1000000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I have another buyer, John, who is ready to pay $1200000, but I'd prefer to work with you. I can offer the product at $1300000, which is still a great value considering its worth. Would you be able to meet me at this price?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
