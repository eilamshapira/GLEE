"Hello Alice, thank you for offering this product. While it seems interesting, $150 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a better price. Let me think for a moment... How about we meet in the middle between my original offer and your counteroffer?",112.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for considering my offer, Alice. While I appreciate you meeting me halfway, $112.5 is still a bit above what I had in mind. How about we settle at $90? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your patience and for trying to find a mutually beneficial price. I appreciate your offer of $90, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $105? This is the lowest I'm comfortable going.",105.0,Alice,5,
