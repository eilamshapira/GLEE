(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $1,150,000 is close to my maximum budget of $1,200,000, but still below it, I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better deal. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, I'll start by offering a price that is slightly above that value.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,120,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Since we're only in Round 3 and I have 7 more rounds to negotiate, I'll try to make another counteroffer to see if I can get an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","In Round 4, I'll try to meet Alice halfway between her last offer and my previous counteroffer. Alice's last offer was $1,120,000, and my previous counteroffer was $1,050,000. A midpoint between these two prices would be $1,085,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, but I still think I can do better. Since we're halfway through the negotiation rounds, I'll try to make another counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous one, but still lower than Alice's current offer.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","In Round 6, I'll try to make a counteroffer that is closer to Alice's last offer, but still slightly lower. Alice's last offer was $1,100,000, so I'll offer $1,075,000, which is a small increase from my previous counteroffer of $1,085,000 is a bit higher than this, so I will offer $1,090,000 then $1,075,000,  $1,090,000 is a bit higher than $1,085,000 and $1,075,000 is lower than $1,085,000.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,090,000 is very close to a price I'm comfortable with, and it's actually the same price I was considering offering in the previous round. At this point, I think it's a good deal, and rejecting it might risk Alice not being willing to go any lower.
