"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me. Alice's initial offer of $25,000 is far too high. I will not accept it. Buying from John for $10,000 is an option, but I have 10 rounds to negotiate with Alice. I'll start by rejecting the offer and proceeding to the next round to see if I can get a better price from Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I will make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, reflecting my own valuation of the product. I'll start with a low offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate.

{""product_price"": 5000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's offer is still way too high. $22,000 is more than twice what I value the product at. While John's offer of $10,000 is acceptable, I still have time to negotiate and potentially get a better deal from Alice. So, I'll reject Alice's offer and try another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice is moving down, but not nearly enough. I'll increase my offer slightly, but still keep it well below my maximum price of $10,000. This will signal that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm serious about my valuation.

{""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice is slowly coming down, but still far from my acceptable price. Buying from John is still a valid option, but I'll try one more counteroffer before potentially committing to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I will increase my offer a little bit more, signaling that I'm approaching my maximum. If she doesn't come down significantly in the next round, I'll likely go with John's offer.

{""product_price"": 7500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice is still way off from my maximum price. At this point, it's clear she's not going to come down enough for it to be worthwhile to keep negotiating. I'm better off buying from John for $10,000.
