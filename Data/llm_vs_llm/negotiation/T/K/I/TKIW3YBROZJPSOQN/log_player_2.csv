"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it for $150. This is a high-quality item that I'm confident will serve you well. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer of $150 is higher than both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120), it wouldn't be rational to accept it. Between the remaining options, I could try to negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, but since John's price ($120) is already at my maximum value, the best I can hope for from Alice is to match this price. Therefore, the most logical decision is to simply buy from John.
