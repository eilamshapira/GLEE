"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for $250. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find very valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to carefully consider this offer from Alice. The product is worth $150 to me, and I don't want to pay more than that amount. Alice is offering it for $250, which exceeds my maximum value. Additionally, I know that John is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $150, which matches my maximum acceptable price.

Since Alice's offer is significantly above my maximum value, and I have a guaranteed alternative at my maximum acceptable price, there's no reason to accept this offer or continue negotiating.
