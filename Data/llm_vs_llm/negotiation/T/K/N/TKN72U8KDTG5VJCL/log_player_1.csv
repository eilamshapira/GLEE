Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm very interested in the product, I believe $950000 is quite high considering market conditions. I'd like to propose a more balanced price that could work for both of us.

I reject Bob's offer of $850,000 because it's close to the minimum value I have for the product, which is $800,000, and I believe I can negotiate a better price. I'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to see if we can meet at a more favorable price for me."

I reject Bob's offer of $875,000. Although he has increased his offer, it's still below what I'm aiming for, considering the product's value to him is $1,000,000. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm willing to continue discussing the price to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll proceed to make another counteroffer."
