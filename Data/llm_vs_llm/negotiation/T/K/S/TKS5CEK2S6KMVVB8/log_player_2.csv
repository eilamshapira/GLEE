# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. How about you purchase it for $200?

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $80."", 
""product_price"": 80
}
```

I'm starting with a low offer to get a sense of Alice's potential bottom line.  There's a chance she accepts, but even if she rejects, it will give me information to work with in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob! I understand your budget constraints. How about I sell you the product for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but she's still significantly higher than my target price and what John offers. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, $150 is still a bit steep for me. Could you do $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still keeping it well below her current offer and under John's price."
