Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll analyze this situation:

1) The product is worth at least $12,000 to me (my minimum selling price)
2) The product is worth $10,000 to Bob (his maximum buying price)
3) If Bob rejects, I can sell to John for $12,000 guaranteed

Since Bob values the product at $10,000, he won't accept any offer above that amount. And since I can get $12,000 from John, which is more than Bob's maximum ($10,000), it makes more sense to sell to John.

I should offer Bob a price that respects my minimum value while acknowledging the market reality:

{""product_price"": 12000}

This offer maintains my minimum selling price. While Bob will likely reject this, that's actually the optimal outcome since I can then sell to John for the same amount, which exceeds what Bob would pay."
