"Hello Alice, thank you for offering this product. I'm interested, but the price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to negotiate and find a price that works for both of us. I can offer you a better deal than my initial offer, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $100?",100.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I could potentially go up to $70, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your updated offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price. I'm still a bit away from being able to sell it to you at $70, but I'm willing to come down further. How about we try $90?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $90 is close, but it's a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $80? That's the absolute highest I can go.",80.0,Bob,6,
