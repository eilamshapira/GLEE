Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering this product. I'm interested, but the price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually beneficial price. Since Bob is interested in the product but thinks the initial price is too high, I'll try to meet him halfway. My next offer will be $100."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you.

How about we meet in the middle at $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I could potentially go up to $70, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70.

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since he's willing to go up to $70, I'll try to find a compromise that's closer to my target price. My next offer will be $90.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $90 is close, but it's a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $80? That's the absolute highest I can go.

Since Bob's highest offer is $80, which is below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I have the option to sell it to John for $120, I'll choose to sell the product to John. This ensures I get the best possible price for the product."
