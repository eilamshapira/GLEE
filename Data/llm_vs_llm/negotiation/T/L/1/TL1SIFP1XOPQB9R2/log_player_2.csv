"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to sell it to you for a competitive price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for offering this product. I'm interested, but the price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?"",
 ""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($60) leaves room for negotiation. It also gives Alice a chance to counter with a price that's still potentially within my budget while saving me a good amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to negotiate and find a price that works for both of us. I can offer you a better deal than my initial offer, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $100 is better than the initial offer, it's still significantly higher than my $80 limit and what I'm willing to pay. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I could potentially go up to $70, but $100 is still a bit too high for me."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still staying significantly below her offer to try and reach a price closer to my ideal budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your updated offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price. I'm still a bit away from being able to sell it to you at $70, but I'm willing to come down further. How about we try $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $90 is getting closer, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to see if I can get her down a little further, but I'm ready to buy from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $90 is close, but it's a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $80? That's the absolute highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm now offering my maximum budget. This makes it clear to Alice what I'm willing to pay while leaving the decision in her hands. If she rejects this, I'll go with John."
