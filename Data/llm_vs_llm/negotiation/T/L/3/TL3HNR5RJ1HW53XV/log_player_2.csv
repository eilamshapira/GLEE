"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer of $11,900, reject it, or buy from John for $12,000.

The product is worth up to $12,000 to me, and I want to save as much money as possible.

Alice's offer ($11,900) is $100 less than John's price ($12,000).

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving money, and Alice's offer is lower than John's, I should accept Alice's offer.
