Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price that is competitive enough to entice Bob but also maximizes my profit. Since I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price (John), I can set my price to Bob higher than that floor.

Without knowing Bob's valuation, I'll set a price that gives me a significant premium while still potentially being attractive to Bob if he values the product highly.
