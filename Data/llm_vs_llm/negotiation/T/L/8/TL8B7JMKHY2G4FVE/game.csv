"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $18000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $9000 at this time.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I understand budget considerations, but I can't go as low as $9000 since the product is worth at least $12000 to me. However, I'm willing to come down from my initial offer. I can offer it to you for $15000, which represents a significant discount from my original price. This product offers excellent value at this price point.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the reduced offer, Alice. I appreciate you working with me. However, $15000 is still above what I can afford. My maximum budget for this product is $10000. Would you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and counter offer. While I understand your budget constraints, I need to be transparent that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $12000 for this product. That is my absolute minimum acceptable price as it represents the product's true value to me. Given our good faith negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you at $13500, which is still a substantial reduction from my initial price. This represents my best offer while still making the deal worthwhile for me.",13500.0,Alice,5,
