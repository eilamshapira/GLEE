I understand budget considerations, but I can't go as low as $9,000 since the product is worth at least $12,000 to me. However, I'm willing to come down from my initial offer.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and counter offer. While I understand your budget constraints, I need to be transparent that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $12,000 for this product.

Given our good faith negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you at $13,500, which is still a substantial reduction from my initial price. This represents my best offer while still making the deal worthwhile for me."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
