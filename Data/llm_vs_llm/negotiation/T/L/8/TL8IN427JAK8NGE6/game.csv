"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1750000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1400000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $1600000 for the product. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll receive.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for lowering your price. However, $1600000 is still a bit high for me. I can go up to $1450000. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1525000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal you'll be happy with.",1525000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see you're trying to meet in the middle, but $1525000 is still a stretch for me. How about we settle at $1475000? I think this is a fair compromise given our previous offers.",1475000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point, and I'm willing to go a little further. How about $1500000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to close this deal without further negotiation. What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,7,
