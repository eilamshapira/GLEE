Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I get well above my minimum value.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","The offer of $120 is reasonable - it's above my minimum value of $100 and notably higher than John's standing offer. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk that pushing too hard might lead Bob to walk away, leaving me with only John's $100 offer. I'll accept this offer.
