"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $10000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $10000 is a bit high for my budget. Given that I can get a similar product elsewhere for $10000, I'd like to propose $7000. This would make it more attractive for me to buy from you rather than your competitors. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8500.  This is a great price for the value you'll get.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I can see we're getting closer. How about we meet in the middle at $7750? This would be a fair deal for both of us, giving you a better price than my initial offer while still providing me with good value.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7750 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8125? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale.  What do you think?",8125.0,Alice,5,
