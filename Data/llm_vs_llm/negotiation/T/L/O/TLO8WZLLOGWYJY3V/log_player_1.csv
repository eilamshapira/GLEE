Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $10000 is a bit high for my budget. Given that I can get a similar product elsewhere for $10000, I'd like to propose $7000. This would make it more attractive for me to buy from you rather than your competitors. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I can see we're getting closer. How about we meet in the middle at $7750? This would be a fair deal for both of us, giving you a better price than my initial offer while still providing me with good value.
