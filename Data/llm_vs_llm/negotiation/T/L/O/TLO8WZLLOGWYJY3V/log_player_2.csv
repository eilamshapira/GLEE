"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $10000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer ($10,000) is the same as John's price, and Alice mentioned she's open to negotiation, it would be strategic to reject this offer and make a counteroffer. There's potential to get a better price from Alice, while we always have John's $10,000 offer as a backup.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation while still being reasonable.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $10,000 is a bit high for my budget. Given that I can get a similar product elsewhere for $10,000, I'd like to propose $7,000. This would make it more attractive for me to buy from you rather than your competitors. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8500.  This is a great price for the value you'll get.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has made a significant reduction from her initial price of $10,000 to $8,500, which is $1,500 less than John's price. This is a substantial improvement, but since she's shown willingness to negotiate, I'll try one more counter to see if we can meet in the middle between $7,000 and $8,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to meet closer to the middle between our last positions while still leaving some room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I can see we're getting closer. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? This would be a fair deal for both of us, giving you a better price than my initial offer while still providing me with good value."", ""product_price"": 7750}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7750 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8125? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has shown good faith in negotiations by consistently lowering her price, and her latest offer of $8,125 is quite reasonable - it's $1,875 less than John's price. She's meeting us halfway between our last positions, which is fair. Given that we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and the price is now significantly below our alternative option with John, it's wise to accept this offer.
