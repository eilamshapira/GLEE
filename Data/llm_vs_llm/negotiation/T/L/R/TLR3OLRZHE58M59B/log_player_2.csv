"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice's offer ($150) is exactly the same as John's price ($150)
2. This is the first round, so I have room to negotiate for a better price
3. The product is worth no more than $150 to me, so I shouldn't pay more than that
4. Since I can always fall back on John's offer, I can try to negotiate with Alice for a better price

Given these factors, I should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. If negotiations fail, I can still buy from John at $150.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since this is my first counteroffer, I'll start significantly lower to leave room for negotiation. Given that $150 is my maximum value, I'll start at around 60% of that price.
