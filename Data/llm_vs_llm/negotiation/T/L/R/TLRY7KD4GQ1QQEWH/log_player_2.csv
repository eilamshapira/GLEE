"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to analyze this offer carefully:

- The product is worth up to $12,000 to me (my maximum valuation)
- Alice is offering to sell it for $11,500
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $12,000

Since Alice's price ($11,500) is lower than both my maximum valuation ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000), accepting Alice's offer would save me $500 compared to buying from John.
