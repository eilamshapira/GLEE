Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll prepare an offer for Bob.

Looking at the situation, I know that the product is worth $80 to Bob, which is his maximum willingness to pay. The product is worth at least $80 to me, and I have John as a guaranteed backup buyer at $80.

Since Bob won't pay more than the product's value to him ($80), and I can already get $80 from John, there's no benefit in offering Bob a price below $80. If I offer exactly $80, Bob should be indifferent between accepting and rejecting (though people typically accept when indifferent).
