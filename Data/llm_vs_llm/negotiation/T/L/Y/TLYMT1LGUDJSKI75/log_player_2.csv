"Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'll analyze the options:

1. Alice offers the product for $80
2. If I reject, I can buy from John for $80
3. The product is worth no more than $80 to me

Since all options lead to the same price ($80), and this is the maximum I value the product, I'm indifferent between buying from Alice or John. I might as well accept Alice's offer since the outcome is identical.
