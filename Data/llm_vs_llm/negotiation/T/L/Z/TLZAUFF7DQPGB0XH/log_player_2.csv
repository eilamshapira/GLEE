"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative price ($8,000). It would be reasonable to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, as there's room for negotiation to reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 6000}

I'll offer $6,000, which is below both my maximum value and John's price. This gives room for negotiation while potentially saving money compared to John's offer. If Alice rejects this, we can still negotiate upward, or I always have the option to go with John's $8,000 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $13,500 is still significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000). While she did reduce the price from her initial offer, it's still not competitive. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, as there's still plenty of room for negotiation. If we can't reach a reasonable price, I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 7000}

I'm increasing my offer to $7,000, which is still below both my maximum value and John's price. This shows willingness to negotiate upward while maintaining a potential cost savings compared to John's $8,000 offer. If Alice still finds this too low, we have room for further negotiation, or I can ultimately go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still well above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000). While she continues to lower her price, the gap is still too large. Since we're only in round 5 of 10, there's still time for negotiation. However, if Alice doesn't make more significant price reductions soon, it would be more sensible to take John's offer of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 7500}

I'm increasing my offer to $7,500, which is closer to John's price but still gives me a $500 savings if accepted. This shows continued willingness to negotiate upward while staying under my maximum value. If Alice continues to reject offers near this range, it might be better to take John's offer soon, as we're now past the halfway point in our negotiation rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John for $8,000. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer ($12,000) is still significantly above my maximum value ($8,000)
2. Despite multiple rounds of negotiation, Alice's price reductions have been small
3. We're in round 7 of 10, and the gap between Alice's offers and John's price ($8,000) remains too large
4. Based on the pattern of negotiations, it seems unlikely Alice will drop her price below $8,000 in the remaining rounds

Therefore, it's most rational to take John's guaranteed offer of $8,000 rather than risk further rounds of likely unsuccessful negotiation with Alice."
