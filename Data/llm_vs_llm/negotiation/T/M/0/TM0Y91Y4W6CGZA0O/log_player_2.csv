"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $850,000, which is higher than my maximum budget, I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $800,000.
