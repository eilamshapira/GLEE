Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at that price, I'll start with a higher price to leave room for potential negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Given that Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 (which I can get from John), and the offer is not even close to being reasonable, I will reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite low at $800,000, but I want to show some flexibility in negotiation while still maintaining a good profit margin, I'll lower my initial price somewhat but still keep it well above my minimum threshold.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's new offer of $900,000 is still significantly below my guaranteed option of $1,500,000 from John. Since Bob has only increased his offer by $100,000 from his previous bid, and we're still very far from reaching an acceptable price, I think it's best to end the negotiation and take the guaranteed offer from John.
