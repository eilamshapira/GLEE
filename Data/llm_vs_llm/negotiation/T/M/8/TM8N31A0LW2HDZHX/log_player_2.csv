"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, Iâ€™m offering you a unique opportunity to acquire my premium product. I believe the value and potential of this item warrant a price of $2000000. Please let me know if you are interested in sealing the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $2,000,000
3. John is offering the same product for $1,000,000

Alice's offer is clearly higher than both:
- The maximum value I place on the product ($1,000,000)
- John's alternative offer ($1,000,000)

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer as it would mean paying $1,000,000 more than the product's worth to me, and $1,000,000 more than John's price.

The logical choice is to buy from John.
