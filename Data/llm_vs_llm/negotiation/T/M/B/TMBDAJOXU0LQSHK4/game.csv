"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your proposal, but $9000 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know the product is worth $8000 to you, and I can actually purchase it from another seller, John, for $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I'm willing to offer $7200 for the product, which would still give you a good profit while allowing me to save a bit compared to my alternative option. What do you think?",7200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7200 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $8500 for this product. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8500 is still more than I can justify spending on this product. As I mentioned, I have an alternative option to purchase it for $8000, and that's really the maximum I would pay. To make it worth doing business with you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer $7500, which would give you a reasonable profit while giving me an incentive to buy from you rather than the other seller. Does that work for you?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $7500 is still too low for me. While I want to make a deal with you, I need to ensure I can cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $8200. This would give you a fair price and would allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal, what do you say?",8200.0,Alice,5,
