Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your proposal, but $9000 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know the product is worth $8000 to you, and I can actually purchase it from another seller, John, for $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I'm willing to offer $7200 for the product, which would still give you a good profit while allowing me to save a bit compared to my alternative option. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,200 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $8,500 for this product. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8500 is still more than I can justify spending on this product. As I mentioned, I have an alternative option to purchase it for $8000, and that's really the maximum I would pay. To make it worth doing business with you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer $7500, which would give you a reasonable profit while giving me an incentive to buy from you rather than the other seller. Does that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

Round 5

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is still too low for me. While I want to make a deal with you, I need to ensure I can cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $8,200.
