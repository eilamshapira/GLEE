"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $9,000, but I know the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me. Also, I have the option to buy from John for $8,000 at any time.

Since Alice's offer is higher than both my maximum value and John's price, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your proposal, but $9,000 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know the product is worth $8,000 to you, and I can actually purchase it from another seller, John, for $8,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I'm willing to offer $7,200 for the product, which would still give you a good profit while allowing me to save a bit compared to my alternative option. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7200}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7200 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $8500 for this product. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has come down from $9,000 to $8,500, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still higher than John's price of $8,000, and since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, I should not accept this offer.

I could buy from John for $8,000 now, but I'll try one more counteroffer with Alice to see if we can reach a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is still more than I can justify spending on this product. As I mentioned, I have an alternative option to purchase it for $8,000, and that's really the maximum I would pay. To make it worth doing business with you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer $7,500, which would give you a reasonable profit while giving me an incentive to buy from you rather than the other seller. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 7500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $7500 is still too low for me. While I want to make a deal with you, I need to ensure I can cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $8200. This would give you a fair price and would allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal, what do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her offer to $8,200, which is getting closer to John's price of $8,000. However, it's still $200 more than what I could pay to John, and since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, I shouldn't pay more than that.

At this point, I need to decide whether to continue negotiating or accept John's offer. Since Alice knows about my alternative and is still asking for above $8,000, I think it's best to go with John's offer.
