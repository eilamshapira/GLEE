"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay. I know that similar products are available in the market for much less. I'd like to offer $10000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering market conditions.",10000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on market prices, the value of this product to you is higher than your offer suggests. I'm willing to come down to $14000, which still represents a significant discount from the original price but reflects the true value of the product. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're still a bit apart on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $13000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and the initial discount I've already provided. What are your thoughts on this?",13000.0,Alice,3,
