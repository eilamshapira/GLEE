Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $15,000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-value item at a competitive rate. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay. I know that similar products are available in the market for much less. I'd like to offer $10000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on market prices, the value of this product to you is higher than your offer suggests. I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which still represents a significant discount from the original price but reflects the true value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I see we're still a bit apart on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $13,000.
