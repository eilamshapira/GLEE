"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $15000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-value item at a competitive rate. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price of $15,000 is above my maximum value of $12,000, and it's even higher than John's offer of $12,000. It wouldn't make sense to accept this offer. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay. I know that similar products are available in the market for much less. I'd like to offer $10,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering market conditions."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see we're still a bit apart on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $13000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and the initial discount I've already provided. What are your thoughts on this? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above John's price of $12,000, and Alice seems reluctant to go lower than $13,000, it makes more sense to take John's offer. There's no reason to continue negotiating when we have a guaranteed better price available."
