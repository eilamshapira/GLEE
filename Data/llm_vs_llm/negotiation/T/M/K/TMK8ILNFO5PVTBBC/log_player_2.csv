"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'll analyze the situation:

- The product is worth at most $12,000 to me (Bob)
- Alice's product costs her $8,000 (her reservation value)
- John offers the same product for $12,000 (my walk-away option)
- Alice is offering $10,000

Alice's offer of $10,000 is better than John's price of $12,000, which would save me $2,000. However, there might be room to negotiate further since Alice would still profit by $2,000 at her current offer.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This gives me the opportunity to potentially get an even better price while still having John's offer as a backup.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'll analyze the updated offer:

- Alice has reduced her price from $10,000 to $9,500
- This is still $2,500 better than John's offer of $12,000
- Alice's reservation value is $8,000, so she'd still make $1,500 profit
- There might be a bit more room to negotiate, but we're getting closer to a fair deal

Since Alice came down significantly from her initial price and we're making good progress in the negotiation, I'll accept this offer. At $9,500, I'm saving $2,500 compared to my alternative option with John.
