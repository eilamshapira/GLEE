"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1800000 is fair.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's initial offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and even Alice's own value ($1,200,000). This offer is clearly not reasonable as it's more than double what I'm willing to pay, and I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $800,000.

While I could try to negotiate with Alice, her opening offer is so high that it suggests she might not be realistic about pricing. Since I have John's offer as a reliable backup at exactly my maximum acceptable price of $800,000, it would be wise to use that option rather than risk a prolonged negotiation that might not reach an acceptable price.
