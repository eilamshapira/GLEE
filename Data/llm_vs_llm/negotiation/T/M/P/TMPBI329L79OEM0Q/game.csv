"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $150. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $80 is below my minimum selling price. I'm willing to come down to $120, considering your budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you!",120.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 was a bit high for you. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer the product for $110. This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer, so how about $90? I think this is a reasonable price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",90.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, $90 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to lower my price to $105, which is very close to your latest offer. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price!",105.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're getting closer to an agreement. How about we settle at $102? This is just a small step up from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",102.0,Alice,5,
