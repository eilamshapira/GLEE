Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand that $150 was a bit high for you. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer the product for $110. This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}"

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand we're getting closer to an agreement. How about we settle at $102? This is just a small step up from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 102}"
