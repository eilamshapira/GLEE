"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1500000 is significantly above market value for this product. Based on my market research, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000, which I believe is a fair price for this product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your perspective, $1000000 is below our minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1350000? This price reflects the true value of the product and is still a great deal for you.",1350000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm willing to lower the price to $1300000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and should align closely with the product's value. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, I know I can get this product elsewhere for $1200000. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer $1100000, which would be beneficial for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I hear your concerns and I'm keen on closing this deal with you. Considering your last offer and the value this product brings, I can go down to $1250000. This is very close to your desired price range and still fair for both of us. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close to finding a mutually beneficial price. To move forward, I'm willing to lower the price further to $1225000. This is my final offer before considering other options. Let's make this deal happen.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
