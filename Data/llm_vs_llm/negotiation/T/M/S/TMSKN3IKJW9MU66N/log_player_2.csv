"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $1500000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something of great value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer ($1,500,000) is higher than both the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000), I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's below my maximum price and John's price, leaving room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,500,000 is significantly above market value for this product. Based on my market research, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair price for this product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm willing to lower the price to $1300000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and should align closely with the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than John's price of $1,200,000. Since I can get the same product from John for $1,200,000, and Alice's price is still above that, it doesn't make sense to accept this offer. I should reject and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer slightly higher than my previous one but still below John's price, showing willingness to negotiate while maintaining a good deal.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, I know I can get this product elsewhere for $1,200,000. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer $1,100,000, which would be beneficial for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're close to finding a mutually beneficial price. To move forward, I'm willing to lower the price further to $1225000. This is my final offer before considering other options. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is still higher than John's price of $1,200,000. Since there's no advantage to paying more for the same product, and Alice calls this her ""final offer,"" it makes the most sense to buy from John at this point.
