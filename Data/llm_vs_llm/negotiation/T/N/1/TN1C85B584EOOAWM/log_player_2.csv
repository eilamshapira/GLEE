"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $145. This price reflects the product's true worth, and I believe it's a fair offer considering its value. Would you like to purchase it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $145 is close to your maximum budget, there's a chance you could get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, especially since she knows you have an alternative option."
