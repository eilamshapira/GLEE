Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Okay, given Bob's counteroffer of $60, I need to make a decision.

Considering my options:

*   **Accepting $60:** This is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. This is a loss for me.
*   **Rejecting and counter-offering:** This gives me another chance to get a better price, but risks losing the sale entirely.
*   **Selling to John for $150:** This guarantees me a profit of $0.

I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob since the chance of the next round might be better than selling to John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Okay, I'm facing another decision.

*   **Accepting $75:** Still below my minimum of $150, so this is a loss.
*   **Rejecting and counter-offering:** This gives me another chance, but risks losing the sale.
*   **Selling to John for $150:** This guarantees me a profit.

Given Bob's low offer and the fact that I can get $150 from John, I'm going to cut my losses and secure the sale with John.
