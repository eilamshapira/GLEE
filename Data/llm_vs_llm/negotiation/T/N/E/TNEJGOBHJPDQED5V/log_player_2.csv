"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is offering the product for her maximum price.  There's no benefit to accepting her offer over buying from John. By rejecting, I might incentivize her to offer a lower price."
