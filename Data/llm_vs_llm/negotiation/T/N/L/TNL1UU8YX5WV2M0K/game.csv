"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price of $2300000 is higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000, considering the product's value and market conditions.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $1000000 is significantly below the product's value. Given its quality and market position, I can offer it to you for $1900000, which is a substantial reduction from my initial offer. Would this price work for you?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate the reduction in price. However, $1900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value and my budget, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. This is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
