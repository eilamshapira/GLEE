Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price of $2300000 is higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000, considering the product's value and market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 (which I can get from John), but Bob's interest suggests there might be room for negotiation at a higher price.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $1,000,000 is significantly below the product's value.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate the reduction in price. However, $1900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value and my budget, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. This is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.

I'll sell to John since Bob's maximum offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. Continuing negotiations with Bob seems unlikely to yield a better result, especially since he stated this is his maximum offer."
