"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. The maximum I can go for this product is $650000, which I believe is a fair price considering the market conditions. I have an alternative option to purchase from another seller at $800000, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $650000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to lower the price to $850000, acknowledging the market dynamics you mentioned. This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and gives you a competitive advantage.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be transparent that I have a firm alternative offer from John at $800000. For me to choose your product over his, I would need a better price. My best offer is $720000, which saves me some money compared to my alternative while giving you a quick sale. This is a fair price that works within my budget constraints while still recognizing the value of your product.",720000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your transparency and understand your position.  While $720000 is closer to my desired price, I need to consider the value of the product and the potential for future opportunities.  I'm prepared to offer a final price of $780000, reflecting a significant discount from my initial offer and acknowledging your budget constraints.  This price is closer to John's offer and offers a substantial saving compared to my initial price.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",780000.0,Alice,5,
