Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. The maximum I can go for this product is $650,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the market conditions.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $650000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to lower the price to $850000, acknowledging the market dynamics you mentioned. This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and gives you a competitive advantage.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and reach an agreement.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has come down to $850,000, which is still $50,000 more than John's price of $800,000. Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, I should reject this offer and continue negotiating for a better price, or consider buying from John.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be transparent that I have a firm alternative offer from John at $800,000. For me to choose your product over his, I would need a better price. My best offer is $720,000, which saves me some money compared to my alternative while giving you a quick sale. This is a fair price that works within my budget constraints while still recognizing the value of your product."", ""product_price"": 720000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your transparency and understand your position.  While $720000 is closer to my desired price, I need to consider the value of the product and the potential for future opportunities.  I'm prepared to offer a final price of $780000, reflecting a significant discount from my initial offer and acknowledging your budget constraints.  This price is closer to John's offer and offers a substantial saving compared to my initial price.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has offered the product for $780,000, which is $20,000 less than John's price of $800,000. Since this price is below the maximum value of $800,000 that the product is worth to me, and it's less than my alternative option, this is a good deal.
