"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,199,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,199,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me think about this decision:

The product is worth at most $1,200,000 to me (Bob).
Alice is offering to sell it for $1,199,999.
If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $1,200,000.

Alice's offer is $1 cheaper than John's offer. While the savings is minimal, it's still a savings. Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, I should accept Alice's offer.
