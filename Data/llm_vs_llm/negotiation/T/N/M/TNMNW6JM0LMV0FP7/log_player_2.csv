"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I'm currently offering to you before exploring other opportunities. Based on my market research, this product is valued at $1200000. However, I'm willing to offer it to you at $850000, which represents a significant discount from the market value. This is a limited-time offer as I already have another interested buyer willing to pay $1000000. I wanted to give you the first opportunity since I believe this product would be particularly valuable for your needs. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
