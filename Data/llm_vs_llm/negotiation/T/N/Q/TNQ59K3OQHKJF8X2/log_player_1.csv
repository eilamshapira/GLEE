Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make an offer to Bob that maximizes my profit while being acceptable to him.

The product is worth $100 to Bob, so he should be willing to pay up to $100 for it.
I could sell the product to John for $80 if Bob rejects my offer.

If I offer the product to Bob at a price close to $100, he might reject it as there's little benefit for him. If I offer it at a price too close to $80, I'm not maximizing my profit.

A reasonable price would be somewhere between these values, perhaps closer to Bob's valuation to maximize my profit while still giving him some benefit. I'll offer $95, which gives Bob a $5 benefit while giving me $15 more than my alternative of selling to John.
