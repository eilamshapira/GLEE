"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to evaluate Alice's offer compared to my alternatives.

Alice's offer: $95
John's offer: $100
My maximum value for the product: $100

Since Alice's offer is $95, which is less than my maximum value and also less than John's price, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer. This will save me $5 compared to buying from John.
