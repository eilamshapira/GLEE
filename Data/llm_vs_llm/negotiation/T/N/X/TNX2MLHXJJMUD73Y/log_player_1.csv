Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 19000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he might get a ""deal"" if he counters. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer is also about gauging Bob's interest. If he immediately rejects a price of $19,000, it might indicate the product's value to him isn't significantly higher than your minimum.
* **Backup Plan:** You have the security of John's offer ($12,000). This allows you to be more ambitious in your initial offer to Bob."
