"Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $17000.  This is a great product and you won't find this price anywhere else.  Let me know if you're interested in this price.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $17000. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12000 to $14000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $13000 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $15000?  I'm sure you'll agree this is a fair price for a product of this quality.",15000.0,Alice,5,
