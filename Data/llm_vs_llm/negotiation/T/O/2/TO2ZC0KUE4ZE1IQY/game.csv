"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000, considering my budget and potential return on investment. Would you be willing to sell at this price?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $600000 is significantly below the product's true value. I understand budget constraints, but I cannot go that low. I can adjust my initial offer to $1000000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's quality and potential returns. Would you consider this revised offer?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your revised offer, but $1000000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your revised offer. I'd like to propose a price of $800000. However, I'd like to see if we can do better than that. Would you be willing to sell at $750000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
