Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000, considering my budget and potential return on investment. Would you be willing to sell at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. $600,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, as it's even lower than John's guaranteed offer. I need to negotiate for a better price.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $600,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I understand budget constraints, but I cannot go that low.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your revised offer, but $1000000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your revised offer. I'd like to propose a price of $800000. However, I'd like to see if we can do better than that. Would you be willing to sell at $750000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John. Bob's offer of $750,000 is still below John's guaranteed price of $800,000, and based on Bob's negotiation pattern, it seems unlikely he'll go significantly higher. It's more prudent to take the guaranteed higher amount from John rather than risk further negotiations that might not yield a better result."
