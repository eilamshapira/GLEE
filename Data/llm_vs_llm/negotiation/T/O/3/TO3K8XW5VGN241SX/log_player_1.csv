Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit significantly higher than my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to accept it. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,000,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still well above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'd prefer to get more, selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
