Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my offer to Bob. 

The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, which is his maximum valuation.
The product is worth at least $12,000 to me, and I can sell it to John for exactly $12,000 if Bob rejects my offer.

Since I already have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, and this amount meets my minimum valuation, there's no incentive for me to sell to Bob for less than $12,000. If I offer Bob any price above $10,000, he will reject it since it exceeds his valuation.

Therefore, I should offer Bob the product at exactly $12,000. While he will likely reject this offer (as it's above his valuation), I will then proceed to sell to John at the same price, maximizing my earnings.
