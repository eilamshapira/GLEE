"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its rarity and quality, I'm offering it to you at a special price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me
2. Alice is offering the product for $18,000
3. John is offering the same product for $10,000

The logical decision is to buy from John since:
- Alice's price ($18,000) is significantly higher than my maximum valuation ($10,000)
- John's price ($10,000) matches my maximum valuation
- Buying from Alice would result in an $8,000 loss compared to buying from John
