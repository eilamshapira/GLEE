"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is lower than my minimum acceptable price and also lower than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price from him.

My counteroffer will be $1,400,000.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my new offer is: 
{""product_price"": 1400000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1400000}"

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price and also lower than what I can get from John, but it's getting closer, I will reject Bob's offer again and try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price from him.

My counteroffer will be $1,350,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's last offer.
