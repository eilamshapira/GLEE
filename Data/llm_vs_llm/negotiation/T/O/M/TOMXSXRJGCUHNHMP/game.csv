"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2100000 is far above my budget and the current market value. I've done my research, and similar products are selling for much less. I can offer $700000 for the product, which I believe is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700000 is significantly below the product's true value. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, I need to be transparent - I have another buyer willing to pay $1500000. However, I'm willing to work with you if we can reach a reasonable price. I can reduce my initial ask to $1800000, which is still a fair price given the product's quality and market position. Would you consider this offer?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
