"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,100,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2100000 is far above my budget and the current market value. I've done my research, and similar products are selling for much less. I can offer $700000 for the product, which I believe is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I need to continue negotiating for a better price. Since I can still sell to John for $1,500,000, I have a strong backup option, but I'll try one more time with Bob to see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is significantly below the product's true value. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, I need to be transparent - I have another buyer willing to pay $1,500,000. However, I'm willing to work with you if we can reach a reasonable price. I can reduce my initial ask to $1,800,000, which is still a fair price given the product's quality and market position. Would you consider this offer?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
