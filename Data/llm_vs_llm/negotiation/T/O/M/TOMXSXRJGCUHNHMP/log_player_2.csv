"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2100000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and potential. Would you be interested in making this purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given that the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $2,100,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price, the best decision is to reject this offer. Alice's initial offer is more than 2.5 times what John is asking, and more importantly, it's well above my maximum value.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,100,000 is far above my budget and the current market value. I've done my research, and similar products are selling for much less. I can offer $700,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700000 is significantly below the product's true value. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, I need to be transparent - I have another buyer willing to pay $1500000. However, I'm willing to work with you if we can reach a reasonable price. I can reduce my initial ask to $1800000, which is still a fair price given the product's quality and market position. Would you consider this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,800,000 is still more than twice what John is asking ($800,000) and significantly above my maximum value. While Alice has reduced the price, it's still not close to a reasonable range for me. Additionally, Alice's mention of another buyer at $1,500,000 seems like a negotiation tactic, but even if true, it's still above my maximum value. Given that I can get the product from John for $800,000, which is within my value range, and Alice seems to be anchored at a much higher price point, it's best to end this negotiation.
