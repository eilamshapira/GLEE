"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $160. It's a great value and I think you'll be very happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $120 to me (maximum value I assign to it)
2. Alice is offering it for $160
3. John is willing to sell it for $120

Alice's offer ($160) is above my maximum value ($120), and it's also higher than John's price ($120). There's no reason to accept Alice's offer when:
a) It's above my maximum value
b) I can get the same product from John for less

The logical choice is to buy from John for $120.
