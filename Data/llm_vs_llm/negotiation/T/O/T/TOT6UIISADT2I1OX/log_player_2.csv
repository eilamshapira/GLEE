"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price of $12,000 is higher than both my maximum valuation ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000). It wouldn't make sense to accept this offer. I'll reject and make a counteroffer to Alice, knowing I can always fall back on John's $10,000 offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 8000}

I'll offer $8,000, which is below John's price of $10,000. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to John's offer. Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, there might be a chance she'll accept a price that still gives her some profit but is below John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's new offer of $11,000 is still above John's price of $10,000, it makes more sense to buy from John. Alice seems unwilling to go below John's price, and since John's price ($10,000) matches my maximum valuation, I'll take his offer rather than continue negotiating with Alice."
