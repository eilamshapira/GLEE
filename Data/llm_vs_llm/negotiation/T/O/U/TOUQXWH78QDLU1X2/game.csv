"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price.",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you considering my budget. While I recognize the product's value, $25000 is significantly outside my range. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford right now. Let me know if you're open to this price.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I must consider the product's value and the fact that I have another offer on the table. I'm willing to compromise, but $12000 is below my expectations. I can offer you a price of $22000, which is still a significant reduction from my initial offer.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $22000 is still a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $17000? This would allow me to purchase the product while staying within my financial constraints.",17000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. Meeting you halfway at $17000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I still believe the product's value warrants a slightly higher price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you a price of $20000. This is the lowest I'm comfortable going, considering the product's worth and the alternative offer I have.",20000.0,Alice,5,
