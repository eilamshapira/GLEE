Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. Meeting you halfway at $17000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I still believe the product's value warrants a slightly higher price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you a price of $20000. This is the lowest I'm comfortable going, considering the product's worth and the alternative offer I have.
