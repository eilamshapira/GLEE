"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since the product is worth no more than $150 to me, and Alice's offer of $200 is significantly higher than this value, it wouldn't be rational to accept her offer. Additionally, John is offering the product at $150, which matches my maximum valuation. Therefore, the best decision would be to buy from John.
