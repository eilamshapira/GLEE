"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Would you be willing to consider this price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is too low for the quality of this product. I understand $180 might be outside your budget, so I can offer it to you for $150. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and reflects the true value of the product. Would this work better for you?",150.0,Alice,3,
