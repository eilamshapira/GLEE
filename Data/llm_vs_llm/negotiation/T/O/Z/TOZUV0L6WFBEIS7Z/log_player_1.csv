"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $90 is too low as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is too low for the quality of this product. I understand $180 might be outside your budget, so I can offer it to you for $150. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and reflects the true value of the product. Would this work better for you?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my budget and reducing the price to $150. However, I'm still a bit short of that amount. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $100. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal at this amount. Would you be willing to consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and he hasn't shown willingness to approach this price point after multiple rounds of negotiation, I'll take the guaranteed offer from John at $120."
