"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product, and I believe it would be a great fit for you. Considering its value and the benefits it can bring, I'm willing to sell it to you for a price slightly lower than what I could get from another buyer. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Analyzing the situation:

1. The product is worth at most $10,000 to me (Bob).
2. Alice is offering it for $14,999, which is more than it's worth to me.
3. John is offering the same product for $10,000, which matches exactly what it's worth to me.

Given these facts, paying $14,999 would mean I'm paying $4,999 more than the product's value to me. The logical choice would be to buy from John at the fair price.
