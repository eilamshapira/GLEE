"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay ($1,200,000) and buying from John would cost the same, I might as well accept Alice's offer to avoid any potential hassle or difference in the product or service.
