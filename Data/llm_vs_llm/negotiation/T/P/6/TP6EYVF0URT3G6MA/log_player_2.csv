"Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'm considering Alice's offer of $145 for the product, which is worth no more than $150 to me.

If I reject Alice's offer, my alternative is to buy from John for $150. Since Alice's offer of $145 is $5 less than John's price, and still within my maximum value for the product, it makes financial sense to accept Alice's offer.
