"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Based on the given information:

1. The product is worth at most $10,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering the product for $12,000
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $10,000

Since Alice's offer ($12,000) exceeds the maximum value of the product to me ($10,000), and John's offer ($10,000) matches the maximum value, it makes economic sense to buy from John.
