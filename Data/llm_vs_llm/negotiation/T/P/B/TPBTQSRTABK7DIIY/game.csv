"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $17000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Let me know if we can work something out.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, the price of $9000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to lower my price further to $16000. Let's see if that works for you!",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to negotiate with me. I understand that $9000 was too low, but $16000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. How about $12500?",12500.0,Bob,6,
