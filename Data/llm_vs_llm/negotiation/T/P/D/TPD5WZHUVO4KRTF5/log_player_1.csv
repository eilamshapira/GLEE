Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price, I'll start with a higher offer to Bob to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I can still make a good profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and John's guaranteed offer, I will accept Bob's offer. This gives me a $200,000 premium over my alternative option of selling to John.
