"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1700000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1700000 is too high for me. The market value for similar products is significantly lower, and I know I can get this product elsewhere for $1500000. However, I'd like to work with you. I can offer $1300000 for the product. This is a fair offer that would benefit both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value. While I appreciate your offer, $1300000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it for $1600000.  Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I need to be transparent with you. I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $1500000. I would prefer to do business with you, but I can't justify paying more than what I can get elsewhere. I can offer you $1400000, which is still a reasonable price and would save me the hassle of going with another seller. What do you say?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split the difference. I'm offering you the product for $1450000.  This gives you a good price and still allows me to get a fair return on my investment.  What do you say?",1450000.0,Alice,5,
