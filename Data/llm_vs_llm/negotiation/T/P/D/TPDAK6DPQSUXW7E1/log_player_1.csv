Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1700000 is too high for me. The market value for similar products is significantly lower, and I know I can get this product elsewhere for $1500000. However, I'd like to work with you. I can offer $1300000 for the product. This is a fair offer that would benefit both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value. While I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it for $1,600,000.  Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I need to be transparent with you. I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $1500000. I would prefer to do business with you, but I can't justify paying more than what I can get elsewhere. I can offer you $1400000, which is still a reasonable price and would save me the hassle of going with another seller. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
