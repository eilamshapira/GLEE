"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1700000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll reject Alice's offer because $1,700,000 is more than both my maximum value ($1,500,000) and John's price ($1,500,000). Since Alice's initial offer is higher than both these amounts, I'll try to negotiate for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's below my maximum value and John's price, starting relatively low to leave room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,700,000 is too high for me. The market value for similar products is significantly lower, and I know I can get this product elsewhere for $1,500,000. However, I'd like to work with you. I can offer $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair offer that would benefit both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value. While I appreciate your offer, $1300000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it for $1600000.  Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still higher than John's price of $1,500,000, and John's price is a guaranteed option, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer. I'll reject and try one more counteroffer, but if Alice doesn't come down to a price below $1,500,000, I should buy from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I need to be transparent with you. I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $1,500,000. I would prefer to do business with you, but I can't justify paying more than what I can get elsewhere. I can offer you $1,400,000, which is still a reasonable price and would save me the hassle of going with another seller. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split the difference. I'm offering you the product for $1450000.  This gives you a good price and still allows me to get a fair return on my investment.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is now below John's price of $1,500,000, and it's also below my maximum value. This is a good deal that would save me $50,000 compared to buying from John. I should accept this offer.
