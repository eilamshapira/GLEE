"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, $15000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I should mention that another seller, John, is offering the same product for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $8500 for the product. This gives you a quick sale while giving me some savings compared to my alternative option. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $8,500 is still lower than my initial expectation, but I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. My next offer will be $12,000. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your point about the alternative option from John, but I believe my product has unique value that justifies a higher price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. I'd like to offer the product to you for $12,000. This is still a competitive price considering the product's worth, and I'm showing flexibility by not starting from my initial offer. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to continue negotiating.""}"
