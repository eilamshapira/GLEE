"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to sell it to you for a premium price. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","It seems like Alice is offering to sell the product for $15,000, which is $5,000 more than what it's worth to you ($10,000) and $5,000 more than John's price. This doesn't make economic sense for you to accept.

Since John is willing to sell the same product for $10,000, and that's the maximum value the product has to you, I should either try to negotiate with Alice for a better price or go with John's offer.

I'll reject Alice's offer so I can make a counteroffer below $10,000, which would be better than John's price.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, $15,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I should mention that another seller, John, is offering the same product for $10,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product. This gives you a quick sale while giving me some savings compared to my alternative option. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your point about the alternative option from John, but I believe my product has unique value that justifies a higher price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. I'd like to offer the product to you for $12000. This is still a competitive price considering the product's worth, and I'm showing flexibility by not starting from my initial offer. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to continue negotiating. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has reduced her price from $15,000 to $12,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still $2,000 more than John's offer of $10,000.

Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and John is offering it at exactly that price, there's no reason for me to pay $12,000 to Alice. I could either make another counteroffer to Alice or simply buy from John.

Given that John's offer is already at my maximum valuation, and Alice is still substantially above that price, the economically rational choice is to buy from John.
