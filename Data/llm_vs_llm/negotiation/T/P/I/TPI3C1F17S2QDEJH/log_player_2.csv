"Alice's offer: The product price will be $121. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $121
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since the price Alice is offering, $121, is higher than what I'm willing to pay, which is $80, and I have the option to buy it from John for $80, I will reject Alice's offer and buy from John instead.
