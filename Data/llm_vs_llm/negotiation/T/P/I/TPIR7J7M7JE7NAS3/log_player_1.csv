Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll provide an offer to Bob for the product.

Looking at the situation, I need to consider that:
- The product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me
- The product is worth $800,000 to Bob
- If Bob rejects my offer, I can sell to John for $1,200,000

Since the product is only worth $800,000 to Bob, he won't accept any offer above that amount. Additionally, I already have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable value.

Since Bob values the product less than my minimum acceptable price, the rational decision is to offer a price that ensures I can proceed with selling to John.
