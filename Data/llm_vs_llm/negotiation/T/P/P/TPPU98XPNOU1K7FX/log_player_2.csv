"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it at $180, which is a competitive price considering its quality and features. Would you like to purchase it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $180
3. John is willing to sell it for $100

The rational decision would be to buy from John since:
- Alice's price ($180) is significantly higher than my maximum valuation ($100)
- John's price ($100) matches my maximum valuation
- There's no reason to accept Alice's higher price when I can get the same product at a lower price
