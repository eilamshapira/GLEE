"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to consider the options carefully to maximize my value.

The product is worth no more than $120 to me.
- Alice offers it for $115
- John offers it for $120

If I reject Alice's offer, my only other option is to buy from John at $120, which would cost me $5 more than Alice's price.

Since Alice's offer of $115 is below my maximum valuation of $120 and is cheaper than John's alternative, I should accept Alice's offer.
