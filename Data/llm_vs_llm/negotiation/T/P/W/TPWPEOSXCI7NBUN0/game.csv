"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it for $120. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Let me know if you're interested.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice, but $120 is too high for me. I'm looking to spend no more than $50 on your product. Would you be willing to sell it for this price?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking to spend $50, I need to let you know that this product is worth at least $80 to me, and I have another buyer, John, willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Could you meet me at $95? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents good value for this quality product.",95.0,Alice,3,
