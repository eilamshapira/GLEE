Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice, but $120 is too high for me. I'm looking to spend no more than $50 on your product. Would you be willing to sell it for this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

While I understand you're looking to spend $50, I need to let you know that this product is worth at least $80 to me, and I have another buyer, John, willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Could you meet me at $95? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents good value for this quality product."", ""product_price"": 95}"
