Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking to spend $50, I need to let you know that this product is worth at least $80 to me, and I have another buyer, John, willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Could you meet me at $95? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents good value for this quality product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.
