"Hello Bob, I'm glad you're interested in the product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'm starting with a price of $14000, which I think is a fair value considering its worth to both of us.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product to me. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11000, considering the product's value to both of us. I believe this is a fair price and I'm willing to make a deal at this amount.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm glad we can continue negotiating. However, I was thinking that $11000 is a bit low considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I can offer the product to you for $12500, which I believe is a more reasonable price.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I was thinking that $12500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to both of us, I'd like to propose a price of $11750. I believe this is a fair compromise and I'm willing to make a deal at this amount.",11750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I still believe that $11750 is a bit below the product's true value. I'm willing to make a small concession to meet you closer to your target price. I can offer the product to you for $12000, which I think is a reasonable compromise considering the product's worth to both of us.",12000.0,Alice,5,
