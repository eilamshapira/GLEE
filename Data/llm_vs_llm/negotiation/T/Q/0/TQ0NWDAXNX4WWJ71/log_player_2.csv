(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(Let's see if Alice can lower her price. The product is worth only $100 to me, so I won't accept the $240 offer. I also don't want to buy it from John yet because I might be able to get a better deal from Alice.)

My counteroffer to Alice: I am willing to pay $80 for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 80}"
