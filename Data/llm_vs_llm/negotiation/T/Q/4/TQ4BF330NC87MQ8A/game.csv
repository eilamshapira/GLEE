"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has tremendous value, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that reflects its worth. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer.",5000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $5000000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1000000. Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $5000000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product has more value than $1000000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. How about we meet in the middle at $3000000?",3000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $3000000 is still too high for me. I can stretch my budget a bit and offer $1250000. This is my best offer at the moment. Let me know if you can accept this.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget to $1250000. However, I'm still convinced that the product's value lies closer to my initial assessment. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to get at least $2000000 for it. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about we meet at $2000000?",2000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $2000000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $1400000 as my final offer. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your final offer of $1400000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and increase your offer. Although it's still lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to make a concession to try to reach an agreement. I'll meet you halfway between your final offer and my previous counteroffer. How about we settle at $1700000?",1700000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle, but $1700000 is still a bit high for me. I can go up to $1500000, which is the absolute maximum I can spend. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to look elsewhere. Please let me know if you can accept this offer.",1500000.0,Bob,8,
