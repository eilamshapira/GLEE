Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $5000000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1000000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer because I believe the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to him, and I want to try to get a better price. Since selling to John for $1,000,000 is an option that doesn't provide any additional value over Bob's offer, I'll proceed with making a counteroffer to Bob."

I understand that $5,000,000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product has more value than $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $3000000 is still too high for me. I can stretch my budget a bit and offer $1250000. This is my best offer at the moment. Let me know if you can accept this.

I reject Bob's offer because I believe the product is still worth more than $1,250,000. Since Bob is willing to stretch his budget, I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll make another counteroffer to try to get a better price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is not attractive at this point since Bob's offer is already higher than that."

Bob's offer:

I reject Bob's offer because I believe the product is still worth more than $1,400,000. Although Bob has stated that this is his final offer, I'm not convinced that he's unable to go any higher. I'll make another counteroffer to try to get a better price. Since Bob has mentioned considering other options, I'll try to meet him closer to his final offer while still aiming for a higher price.

Bob's offer:

I accept Bob's offer of $1,500,000. At this point, Bob has stated that this is his absolute maximum, and I don't think I can get a significantly better offer from him. Additionally, the offer is 50% higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($1,000,000), which is a good outcome. Continuing to negotiate may risk losing the sale altogether, so I'll accept the offer and close the deal."
