(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $5,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, I will reject his offer. I will also not sell the product to John yet, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob. So, I will proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $7,250 is still below John's offer of $8,000, and I've been trying to get a better price from Bob, I think it's time to consider selling to John. Bob's offers have been increasing, but slowly, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John if I keep negotiating and Bob decides to walk away.
