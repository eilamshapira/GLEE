Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this.

I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at this price. Since I don't know Bob's maximum willingness to pay, but I want to maximize my earnings, I should set a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.

I'll set the price at $1,200,000, which is a 50% premium over my minimum price. If Bob's valuation is higher than this, he'll accept. If he rejects, I still have my guaranteed $800,000 from John.
