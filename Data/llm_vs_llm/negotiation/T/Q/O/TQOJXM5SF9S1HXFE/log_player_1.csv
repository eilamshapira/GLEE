Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly higher price than your minimum allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a much higher profit. If Bob finds this price unreasonable, he has the opportunity to counter-offer, initiating the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation.  His immediate jump to your minimum suggests he might be willing to pay more. Rejecting his offer and presenting a counter-offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to explore the possibility of a higher selling price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:** I am lowering my price significantly from the initial offer, but still staying well above Bob's offer and my absolute minimum. This signals a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a high potential profit."
