"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given that Alice's offer is $1,200,000, which is exactly the same as John's price, and also equal to my maximum valuation, there's no advantage in accepting Alice's offer over buying from John. However, by rejecting and making a counteroffer, there's a possibility to negotiate a better price with Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a significantly lower offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to be unreasonable.

{""product_price"": 800000}

This offer is about 33% lower than Alice's initial price. It's a reasonable starting point that shows I'm serious about purchasing but also trying to get a better deal. If Alice rejects this, we can still negotiate upward while staying below the $1,200,000 ceiling."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced her price by $100,000 from her initial offer, which shows she's willing to negotiate. Since her new offer of $1,100,000 is $100,000 less than both my maximum valuation and John's price, this is a good deal. I could try to negotiate further, but there's a risk Alice might withdraw this offer, and I'm already saving $100,000 compared to my alternatives.
