"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth a premium price, and I'm willing to let it go for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be able to go up to $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $85. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not quite comfortable selling it for that price. I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $110. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  I'm confident this price is fair, considering the value to both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $95. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $105. This is the lowest I'm comfortable going, considering the product's value to me.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have to make a profit, but $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending.  Let's try $98. This is a good compromise, and I believe we can both be happy with this price.",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $98. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. I'm willing to make one more small concession and offer it to you for $100. This is the absolute lowest I'm comfortable going, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",100.0,Alice,7,
