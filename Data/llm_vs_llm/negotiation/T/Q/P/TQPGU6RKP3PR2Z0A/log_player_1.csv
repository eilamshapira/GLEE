"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth a premium price, and I'm willing to let it go for $120."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be able to go up to $85.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, trying to get closer to my target price while still being open to negotiations. Selling to John is an option, but I want to try to get a better deal with Bob first. Accepting Bob's offer of $85 is too low for me, as I believe the product is worth more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $85. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not quite comfortable selling it for that price. I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $110. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $110 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  I'm confident this price is fair, considering the value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make another counteroffer to Bob in the next round. While $95 is closer to my target price, I believe I can still get a better deal. Meeting in the middle doesn't necessarily mean the price is fair, considering the product's value to me is $100. I'll try to get closer to $100 while still being open to negotiations. Selling to John is an option, but I want to try to get a better deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $95. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $105. This is the lowest I'm comfortable going, considering the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have to make a profit, but $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending.  Let's try $98. This is a good compromise, and I believe we can both be happy with this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make another counteroffer to Bob in the next round, but I'm getting close to selling to John. While $98 is a good compromise, I believe I can still get a better deal. Since Bob is only $2 away from my alternative option with John, I'll try to get him to meet me at $100 or very close to it. If not, I'll consider selling to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $98. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. I'm willing to make one more small concession and offer it to you for $100. This is the absolute lowest I'm comfortable going, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}"
