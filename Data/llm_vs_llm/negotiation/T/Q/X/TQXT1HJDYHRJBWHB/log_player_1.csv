Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and John's offer of $15,000, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

My counteroffer for Round 2 is: $14,000

I hope this will bring Bob closer to my target price.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $8,500 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price. Since I have a better offer from John for $15,000, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I will try to negotiate further to see if Bob is willing to increase his offer.

My counteroffer for Round 4 is: $13,500

This is a slightly lower price than my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's current offer.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $9,000 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price, but it's getting closer. However, I still have a better offer from John for $15,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's current offer.

At this point, I don't think Bob is willing to meet my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with John. Therefore, I will stop negotiating with Bob and sell the product to John for $15,000.
