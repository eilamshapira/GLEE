"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given the information, Alice's asking price of $15,000 exceeds what the product is worth to me (maximum $10,000). John is offering the product at exactly what it's worth to me ($10,000).

Since Alice is asking $15,000 which is substantially higher than John's price, and given that I can always fall back on John's offer, I'll reject Alice's initial offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.
