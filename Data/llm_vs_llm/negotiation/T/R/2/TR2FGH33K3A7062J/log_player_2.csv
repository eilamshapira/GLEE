"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer for $120, reject it, or buy from John for $80.

Since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $80, I should not pay $120 to Alice. That would be $40 more than the product's value to me.

The rational choice is to buy from John for $80, as this matches the maximum value I place on the product.
