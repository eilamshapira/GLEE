"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $17000. It's a great deal, and I think it's well worth the value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's offer of $17,000 is above the maximum value of $12,000 that the product is worth to me. It's also significantly higher than John's price of $12,000. There's no reason to accept this offer.

I could make a counteroffer, but since John is already offering the product at exactly my maximum valuation, I should consider if negotiating with Alice will likely result in a better deal.

Given that Alice values the product at $15,000, it's unlikely she'll go below that price, which is already above my maximum.
