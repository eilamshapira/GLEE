"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1900000 is significantly above my budget. While I'm interested in the product, I can only offer $1100000 at this time. This is a fair offer considering current market conditions.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

Given the unique value of this product, my absolute lowest acceptable price is $1700000.
