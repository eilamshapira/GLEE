"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1,900,000. I'm confident you'll see the immense benefit of this acquisition."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1900000 is significantly above my budget. While I'm interested in the product, I can only offer $1100000 at this time. This is a fair offer considering current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $1,100,000, which is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, I must reject it. I believe I can get a better price, and I am not willing to give up on the deal so early.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're aiming for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider. Given the unique value of this product, my absolute lowest acceptable price is $1,700,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of the product, considering its scarcity and potential."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
