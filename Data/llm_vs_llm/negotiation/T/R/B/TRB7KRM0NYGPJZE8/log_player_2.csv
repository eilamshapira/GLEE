"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1900000. I'm confident you'll see the immense benefit of this acquisition. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,900,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum budget ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept this offer. Given that I can always fall back on John's offer, I can try to negotiate with Alice first.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's well below my maximum but leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,900,000 is significantly above my budget. While I'm interested in the product, I can only offer $1,100,000 at this time. This is a fair offer considering current market conditions."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're aiming for a good deal, but $1100000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider. Given the unique value of this product, my absolute lowest acceptable price is $1700000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of the product, considering its scarcity and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,700,000 is still well above both my maximum budget ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000). Since Alice stated her ""absolute lowest acceptable price is $1,700,000"" which is significantly above my maximum budget, and we have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $1,200,000, it makes the most sense to take John's offer rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to succeed.
