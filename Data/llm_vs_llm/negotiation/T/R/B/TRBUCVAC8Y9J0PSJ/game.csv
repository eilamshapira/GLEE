"Hello Bob, I believe this product could be incredibly valuable to you.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing an initial offer of $2300000.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2.3 million is well above what I'm willing to pay for this product. I have other options available at much lower prices. I value this product at $700000, which would be my offer to you.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700000 is significantly below the value this product represents. I'm willing to come down to $1900000. This is a testament to my desire to reach a fair deal with you, while acknowledging the product's true worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $1.9 million is still far above my budget and market value. I should mention that I have another seller offering this product for $1 million. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a reasonable price. I can increase my offer to $850000, which I believe is fair considering the market conditions.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial price.  However, I need to be transparent â€“ selling this product below $1700000 would not be strategically sound for me.  If you're serious about purchasing, this is my final offer.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
