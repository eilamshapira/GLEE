Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2.3 million is well above what I'm willing to pay for this product. I have other options available at much lower prices. I value this product at $700000, which would be my offer to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below the value this product represents. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a testament to my desire to reach a fair deal with you, while acknowledging the product's true worth."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

We've chosen a price significantly higher than both Bob's offer and our minimum, aiming to gauge his flexibility and leave room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $1.9 million is still far above my budget and market value. I should mention that I have another seller offering this product for $1 million. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a reasonable price. I can increase my offer to $850000, which I believe is fair considering the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is moving in the right direction, we're still far from our minimum acceptable price.  We'll continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more agreeable figure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial price.  However, I need to be transparent â€“ selling this product below $1,700,000 would not be strategically sound for me.  If you're serious about purchasing, this is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Strong stance:**  We're communicating that we're firm on our price floor.
* **Sense of urgency:** By stating it's our final offer, we encourage Bob to be more decisive.
* **Open to negotiation:** While firm, we're not entirely shutting down the possibility of him countering."
