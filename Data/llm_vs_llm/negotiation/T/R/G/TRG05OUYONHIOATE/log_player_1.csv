*   **My Target:** I want to maximize my profit, aiming for as close to Bob's valuation as possible while still being above my minimum.
*   **Bob's Offer:** $10,000 is better than selling to John immediately, but still leaves room for negotiation.

*   **Rounds Remaining:** We're only at Round 4, so still plenty of time to try and extract a better price.
*   **John's offer:** $15,000 is a good baseline.
