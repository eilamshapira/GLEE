This is a competitive price considering the product's market worth of $1500000 to you, which would give you a $150000 gain in value. While I have another buyer, John, already willing to purchase at $800000, I wanted to give you the first opportunity as I believe this product aligns perfectly with your needs. I look forward to your decision.
