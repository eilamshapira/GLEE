"Hello Bob, I have a great product to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $95. This is a fair price considering the product's worth.",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $95 is a bit high for me. Given that I can find similar products in the market for lower prices, I would like to offer $70 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is too low for this product. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but my cost base is higher than that. I can offer it to you for $88, which is already a reduction from my initial price and represents good value.",88.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, I know I can get this product elsewhere for $80. I'd like to do business with you, so I'm willing to offer $75. This would still give you a good return while giving me a reason to choose you over other sellers.",75.0,Bob,4,
