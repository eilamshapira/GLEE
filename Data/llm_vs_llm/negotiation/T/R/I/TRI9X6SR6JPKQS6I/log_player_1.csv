"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a great product to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $95. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $95 is a bit high for me. Given that I can find similar products in the market for lower prices, I would like to offer $70 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer since $70 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80, and I want to try negotiating for a better price before settling for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is too low for this product. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but my cost base is higher than that. I can offer it to you for $88, which is already a reduction from my initial price and represents good value."", ""product_price"": 88}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, I know I can get this product elsewhere for $80. I'd like to do business with you, so I'm willing to offer $75. This would still give you a good return while giving me a reason to choose you over other sellers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob has revealed he knows the market price is $80 and is still offering below my minimum acceptable price, and we're already in round 4, it makes more sense to take John's guaranteed offer of $80 rather than continue negotiating. This ensures I get my minimum price and saves time."
