"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $95. This is a fair price considering the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $80 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $95, which is $15 more than my maximum value
3. John is offering it for $80, which is exactly my maximum value
4. Alice's initial offer is clearly too high

Since Alice's offer is significantly above my maximum value ($80), and even above John's price, it makes sense to reject it and make a counteroffer. While I could go directly to John, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first to potentially get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably below my maximum value to leave room for negotiation while still being fair to Alice.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $95 is a bit high for me. Given that I can find similar products in the market for lower prices, I would like to offer $70 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is too low for this product. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but my cost base is higher than that. I can offer it to you for $88, which is already a reduction from my initial price and represents good value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze the updated situation:

1. Alice has come down significantly from $95 to $88
2. However, $88 is still above both:
   - My maximum value ($80)
   - John's fixed price ($80)
3. There's no reason to accept a price higher than John's offer

Since Alice's price is still above both my maximum value and John's price, there's no reason to accept this offer. However, since Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing her price significantly, it's worth making one more counteroffer before potentially going to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has shown flexibility by coming down to $88, and we know her costs are a concern, I'll make a more reasonable counteroffer that's closer to my target while still leaving room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, I know I can get this product elsewhere for $80. I'd like to do business with you, so I'm willing to offer $75. This would still give you a good return while giving me a reason to choose you over other sellers."", ""product_price"": 75}"
