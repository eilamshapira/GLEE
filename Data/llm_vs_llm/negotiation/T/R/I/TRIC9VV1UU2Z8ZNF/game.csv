"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $9500 is quite close to market price. Given that I'm looking to make a direct purchase, I'd like to offer $8500, which I believe is a fair price that would still provide you with a good profit margin.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $8500. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, my product has proven quality and value. I can come down to $9000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer and is still below the market value of $10000. This would give you a healthy margin while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price. You make a fair point about the product's quality, and I acknowledge the value you're offering. To meet you in the middle, I'm willing to increase my offer to $8750. This represents a significant profit over your cost while still giving me some savings compared to the market price. Would you consider this as a fair compromise?",8750.0,Bob,4,
