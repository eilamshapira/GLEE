"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to test Bob's willingness to pay and leave room for negotiation while ensuring I stay well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.

{""product_price"": 2,000,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $500,000 as it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Since John is willing to pay $1,200,000, there's no reason to accept anything lower than that. I'll make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still maintain a price well above my minimum to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 1,800,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer of $600,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and he's only increased his offer by a small amount. Given that we've gone through several rounds already and Bob's offers are still far below my minimum, plus I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $1,200,000, I'll choose to sell to John now.
