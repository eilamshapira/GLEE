"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer ($12,000) is higher than both my maximum valuation ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000), it wouldn't be rational to accept Alice's offer. John's offer provides the same product at a lower price.
