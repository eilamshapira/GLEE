"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $12000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to pressure me into accepting her offer by mentioning another buyer and a lower price.  While she *might* have another buyer, her tactic makes me suspicious. Since I can get the product for $15,000 from John without the pressure tactics, I'll reject Alice's offer and see if she's willing to come down."
