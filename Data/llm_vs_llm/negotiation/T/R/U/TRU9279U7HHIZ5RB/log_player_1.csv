"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I don't go below my minimum acceptable price of $120.

{""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $80 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $120, I would be better off rejecting Bob's low offer.

Additionally, since Bob's initial offer is exactly equal to his known value for the product ($80), it suggests he might not be willing to go much higher. Rather than continuing negotiations that might not lead anywhere, I'll take the guaranteed $120 from John.
