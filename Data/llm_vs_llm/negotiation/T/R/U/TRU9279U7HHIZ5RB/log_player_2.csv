This product is worth $80 to me, and Alice is offering it for $160. It's way too expensive. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}

I'm offering the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. I'm hoping Alice will see that it's a fair price, considering it's worth $120 to her."
