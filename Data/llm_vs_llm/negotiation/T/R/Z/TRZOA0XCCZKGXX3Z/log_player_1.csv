"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Based on its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm offering it to you for $25,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $25000 is way above what I'm willing to pay. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $12000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a tough one. Bob's offer is significantly below my floor. I need to try to get more, but I also don't want to risk losing the sale entirely.

I'm going to **Reject Bob's offer** and make a counteroffer. My reasoning is that I still have several rounds to negotiate and I believe there's room to find a price that is good for both of us.

Therefore, my decision is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I can't go as low as $12,000. Considering the product's value, the lowest I can go is $22,000. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $22000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $17000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Okay, this is getting closer. $17,000 is better than my floor, but I still think I can get a bit more. I'm going to **Reject Bob's offer** and counter again.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle and settle at $19,500? That's the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 19500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about $18000? I'm really hoping we can find common ground and get this deal done.   
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Okay, $18,000. This is a tough decision. I've been negotiating and I'm above my floor, but I still feel like I *could* get a bit more. However, I'm starting to get worried about losing the deal entirely. I have a few rounds left, but I'm also seeing a good profit here. I believe $18,000 is a good enough deal and I do not want to risk losing the deal.

I will **Accept Bob's offer**.
