"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product, but $150 is more than I'm looking to spend. The product is worth about $100 to me. Additionally, I've found the same product from another seller for $120. I'd like to offer you $100 for it. Would that work for you?",100.0,Bob,2,
