Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product, but $150 is more than I'm looking to spend. The product is worth about $100 to me. Additionally, I've found the same product from another seller for $120. I'd like to offer you $100 for it. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
