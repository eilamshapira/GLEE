"Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Looking at the options, I need to consider which choice is most beneficial for me.

Alice is offering the product for $16,000, which is $1,000 more than the product's maximum worth to me ($15,000).

John is offering the product for $15,000, which is exactly at my maximum valuation.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and John's offer is lower than Alice's, I should choose to buy from John.
