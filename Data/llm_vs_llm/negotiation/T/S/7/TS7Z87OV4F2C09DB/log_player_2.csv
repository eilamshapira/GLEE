"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Okay, let's analyze the situation.

*   **My Value:** $120 (Maximum I'm willing to pay)
*   **Alice's Value:** Unknown, but I know it's at least $80 (she's willing to sell)
*   **Alice's Offer:** $100
*   **John's Offer:** $120

I want to pay as little as possible, and I'd ideally like to pay less than $100.

Since the offer is at $100, and I can get the product for $120 from John. It's better to take the offer.

Therefore, my decision is:

```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```"
