"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer of $12,000 is more than the $10,000 John is asking for the same product, and also more than the maximum worth to me ($10,000), it makes no economic sense to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $11,000 is still higher than John's price of $10,000 and still exceeds what the product is worth to me (max $10,000). Since I have the guaranteed option to buy from John at $10,000, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer.
