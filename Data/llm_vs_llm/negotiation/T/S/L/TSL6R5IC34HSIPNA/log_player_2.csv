Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1800000. What do you say?

# Explanation: By incrementing your offer slightly, you show Alice that you're willing to negotiate but still want to stay within a reasonable budget. This approach might encourage Alice to lower her price further, helping you find a middle ground that saves you more money. If Alice rejects this offer, you can still consider buying from John for $1,000,000, but trying to negotiate further with Alice could potentially result in a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but I believe this product's value is well worth the investment. I'm willing to lower the price to $1500000. What are your thoughts on this? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

# Explanation: Alice's latest offer is still significantly higher than John's price of $1,000,000. Since your goal is to save as much money as possible and you have the option to buy the product from John for a lower price, it makes sense to choose that option instead of continuing to negotiate with Alice. By buying from John, you ensure that you stay within your budget and secure the product at a better price."
