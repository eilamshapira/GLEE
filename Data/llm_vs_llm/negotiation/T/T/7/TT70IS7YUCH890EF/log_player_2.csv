"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to make a decision based on the offers available to me. 

Alice is offering the product for $150, which is significantly above what the product is worth to me (no more than $80).

John is offering the same product for $80, which is exactly at my maximum valuation.

Since I want to save as much money as possible while still getting the product, and Alice's offer exceeds my maximum valuation by a large margin, the most rational choice is to buy from John.
