"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny of $100, considering its quality and value. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point.",100.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks great, $100 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $100 might be a bit steep, but $65 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious concession. How about we settle at $90? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we split the difference again and settle at $75? I think that's a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your willingness to split the difference again. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $75 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering we're getting close, I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $82.50? This is as low as I can go while still feeling like I'm getting a fair deal for the product.",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While that's closer, I'm aiming to keep this under $80.  Would you consider $78?",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your latest offer. I see we're really close now. Considering you're aiming to keep it under $80 and I'm trying to meet you as closely as possible, I'm willing to make a small adjustment. How about we settle at $79.50? This is the lowest I'm comfortable going, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the product's value.",79.5,Alice,7,
