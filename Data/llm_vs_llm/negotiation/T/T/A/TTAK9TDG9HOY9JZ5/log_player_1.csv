"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny of $100, considering its quality and value. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks great, $100 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $65 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob or sell it to John for $80 if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $100 might be a bit steep, but $65 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious concession. How about we settle at $90? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we split the difference again and settle at $75? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Although $75 is getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, it's still below my minimum of $80, and I think I can get a better deal from Bob or sell it to John for $80 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your willingness to split the difference again. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $75 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering we're getting close, I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $82.50? This is as low as I can go while still feeling like I'm getting a fair deal for the product."", ""product_price"": 82.50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While that's closer, I'm aiming to keep this under $80.  Would you consider $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Since $78 is very close to my minimum acceptable price and Bob's target price of under $80, I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to meet him closer to his target while ensuring I get at least my minimum."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your latest offer. I see we're really close now. Considering you're aiming to keep it under $80 and I'm trying to meet you as closely as possible, I'm willing to make a small adjustment. How about we settle at $79.50? This is the lowest I'm comfortable going, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the product's value."", ""product_price"": 79.50}"
