Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your willingness to split the difference again. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $75 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering we're getting close, I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $82.50?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your latest offer. I see we're really close now. Considering you're aiming to keep it under $80 and I'm trying to meet you as closely as possible, I'm willing to make a small adjustment. How about we settle at $79.50? This is the lowest I'm comfortable going, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79.5

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice is getting closer to my price, it's not worth the risk of continued negotiation.  It's better to secure the product from John at $80 and avoid potentially missing out altogether."
