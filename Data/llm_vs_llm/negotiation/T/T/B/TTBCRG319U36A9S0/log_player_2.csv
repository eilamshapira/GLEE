"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to make a decision based on my goal to buy the product while saving as much money as possible.

Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which is $3,000 more than what the product is worth to me ($12,000). 

I have the option to buy from John for $12,000, which matches exactly what the product is worth to me. However, through negotiation with Alice, I might be able to get a better price.

Since we have 10 rounds of negotiation available, I'll reject Alice's initial offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This gives me a chance to potentially save money compared to John's fixed price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice that's below John's price, giving me room to negotiate.

{""product_price"": $9,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has lowered her price from $15,000 to $14,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still $2,000 more than John's price of $12,000, which is also the maximum value the product has to me.

I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating, as we still have several rounds left and Alice seems to be moving in the right direction.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer slightly to show I'm negotiating in good faith, but still aim to get a price below John's $12,000.

{""product_price"": $10,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has lowered her price again to $13,500, which shows continued willingness to negotiate. However, this is still $1,500 more than John's price of $12,000. 

Since the product is only worth $12,000 to me, paying $13,500 would mean I'm losing value on the transaction. John's offer of $12,000 is still better.

I'll reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating, as we still have several rounds left and Alice has been consistently lowering her price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly again to show I'm moving toward a compromise, while still keeping below John's price.

{""product_price"": $11,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has lowered her price to $13,000, which is still $1,000 above John's price of $12,000. 

Since the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and John offers it at exactly $12,000, Alice's offer still doesn't make financial sense for me.

At this point, I'll reject and continue negotiating since Alice has been consistently lowering her price, and we still have a few rounds left.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make one more attempt to reach a deal with Alice that would benefit me more than John's offer. Since we're in round 8 of 10, I'll move closer to my maximum price while still leaving room to save money compared to John's offer.

{""product_price"": $11,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has lowered her price to $12,750, but this is still $750 more than John's price of $12,000.

Since the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me and John offers it at exactly that price, Alice's offer is not better than my alternative option.

We're now in round 9 of 10, and Alice's offers remain above John's price. Given that John's price matches the maximum value the product has to me, I'll choose to buy from John.
