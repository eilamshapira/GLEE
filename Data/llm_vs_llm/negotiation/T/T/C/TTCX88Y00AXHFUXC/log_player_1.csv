Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price to offer to Bob. Let me think about this strategically:

- The product is worth $8,000 to Bob
- The product is worth at least $12,000 to me
- If Bob rejects my offer, I can sell to John for $12,000

Since Bob values the product at $8,000, he won't accept any offer above that amount. And since I can sell to John for $12,000, and the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, I have no incentive to sell to Bob for less than $12,000.

Given these constraints, Bob will reject any offer I make, and I'll end up selling to John for $12,000. The rational choice is to make an offer that Bob will reject.
