Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider this carefully. The product is worth $1,200,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price. The product is only worth $800,000 to Bob, so he won't purchase it for more than that amount.

Since I can already sell to John for $1,200,000 (which is my minimum acceptable value), and Bob values it less than this amount, it doesn't make sense for me to offer Bob a price below $1,200,000. If I did that, I'd be losing money compared to my guaranteed option with John.
