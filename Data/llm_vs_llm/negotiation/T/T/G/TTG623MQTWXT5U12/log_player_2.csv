"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since Alice's offer of $9,999 is higher than my maximum value of $8,000, and John is offering the product at exactly $8,000, I should buy from John to save money.
