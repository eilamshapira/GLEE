"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000}

I'll start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I get at least my minimum desired amount of $1,000,000. This initial offer is 50% above the known value to Bob, which allows for potential back-and-forth negotiation while maintaining a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $700,000 because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. In fact, I can sell to John for $1,000,000, so there's no reason to accept anything less than that from Bob. In the next round, I'll make a more moderate counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement, but I won't go below $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'm lowering my asking price from the initial $1,500,000 to $1,200,000 to show willingness to negotiate, while still maintaining a price above my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. This is a 20% reduction from my initial offer, which signals good faith in the negotiation. However, if Bob continues to offer below $1,000,000, I always have the option to sell to John at $1,000,000, which serves as my BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $800,000. While it's higher than his previous offer of $700,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Since I have John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000, there's no reason to accept anything less. However, I'll make one more attempt with a lower counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement, but it will still need to be above $1,000,000 to be worthwhile for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm lowering my asking price again to $1,100,000, showing further willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price above my minimum threshold. This is now only 10% above my guaranteed option with John. If Bob continues to offer below $1,000,000, I will likely choose to sell to John instead of continuing negotiations, as we're already halfway through our available rounds and Bob's offers are still significantly below my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll end the negotiation with Bob and sell to John. Here's why:

1. Bob's offers have only incrementally increased ($700k → $800k → $900k), suggesting he's unlikely to reach or exceed $1M
2. We're already 6 rounds into the negotiation
3. John's guaranteed offer of $1M is better than Bob's current offer
4. The product is worth $1M to Bob, so he's unlikely to pay significantly more than that
5. Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of running out of rounds without a better deal

It's most rational to take the guaranteed $1M from John rather than continue negotiating with Bob, who seems unwilling to meet my minimum acceptable price."
