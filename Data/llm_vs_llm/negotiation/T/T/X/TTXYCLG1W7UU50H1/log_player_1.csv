(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I still think I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

While this offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not convinced it's the best I can get.  I'll counter again, but I'm starting to think John might be the better option."
