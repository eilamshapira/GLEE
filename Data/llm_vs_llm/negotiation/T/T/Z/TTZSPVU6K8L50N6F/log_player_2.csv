"Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price offered by Alice ($250) is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($120) and John's alternative offer ($120). It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer, as there's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. If the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory price, I can always fall back on John's offer of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 80}

I'm offering $80, which is significantly lower than both John's price ($120) and Alice's initial offer ($250). This gives room for negotiation while potentially allowing me to save money compared to John's price. If Alice rejects this offer, we can continue negotiating, and I still have the option to buy from John at $120 if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $220. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $220
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $220 is still well above both my maximum valuation ($120) and John's price ($120). While Alice has reduced her price from the initial $250, it's still not competitive with John's offer. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, as there's still room for negotiation. If we can't reach a better price, I can always take John's offer of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 90}

I'm offering $90, which is a slight increase from my previous offer of $80. This shows some willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price well below John's offer of $120. This gives Alice room to counter while maintaining my potential savings. If Alice doesn't accept or come back with a reasonable counter, I still have the option to buy from John at $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $190. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $190
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's latest offer of $190 is still significantly above John's price of $120. Although Alice has been lowering her price throughout the negotiation (from $250 to $220 to $190), she's still not close to matching John's price. Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and Alice seems unlikely to match or beat John's price in the near future, it's most rational to end the negotiation and buy from John at $120."
