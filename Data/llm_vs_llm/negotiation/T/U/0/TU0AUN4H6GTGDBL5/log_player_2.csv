"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $15,000 is significantly above both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000). It would be better to either negotiate for a lower price or buy from John. Let's try negotiating with Alice first to see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 8000}

I'll start with a lower counteroffer of $8,000. This is strategically below my maximum value of $10,000, leaving room for negotiation. Since I know the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, and I have John's $10,000 offer as a backup, this gives us room to potentially find a price that works for both parties. If Alice rejects this, we can still negotiate upward while staying under my $10,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice only reduced her price by $1,000, from $15,000 to $14,000, which is still well above both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000). The offer remains unacceptable. I'll continue negotiating since we still have several rounds left, but if Alice doesn't make more significant price reductions, we can always fall back on John's offer of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm increasing my offer to $9,000, which is still below my maximum value of $10,000 and John's price. This $1,000 increase from my previous offer shows willingness to negotiate while keeping room for further negotiation. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, she's still taking a loss at this price, but it's getting closer to her cost. If she doesn't accept this or come back with a reasonable counter, we can always go with John's offer of $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John now for $10,000. Here's why:

1. Alice's latest offer ($13,000) is still well above my maximum value ($10,000)
2. While Alice is showing some movement in price (from $15,000 to $13,000), she's still far from reaching a price that would be acceptable to me
3. The product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so it's unlikely she'll go below that price
4. We've gone through 5 rounds already, and the gap is still too large
5. John's offer of $10,000 exactly matches my maximum value

It's better to secure the deal with John now rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to result in a better price than $10,000."
