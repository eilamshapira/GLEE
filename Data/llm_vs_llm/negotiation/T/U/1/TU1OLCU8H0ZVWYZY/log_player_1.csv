Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this. Since I know the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $12,000, I can afford to make a higher offer to Bob. I'll set a significantly higher price to maximize my potential profit, while still keeping it within a reasonable range that Bob might accept.
