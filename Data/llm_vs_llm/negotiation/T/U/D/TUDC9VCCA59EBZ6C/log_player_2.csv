"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a fair price.  How about $100? This is a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth up to $120 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering it for $100
3. John is selling it for $120

Given these options:
- If I accept Alice's offer, I'll pay $100 and save $20 compared to John's price
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can still try to negotiate a better price with her
- Buying from John for $120 is the worst option as it's the highest price

Since $100 is below my maximum value ($120) and it's better than John's price, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer. Even though Alice is making a profit (since it's worth $80 to her), I'm still getting a good deal compared to my alternatives.
