Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. Since I know I can sell the product to John for $12,000, that's my guaranteed minimum price. Bob's maximum valuation is unknown, but if it's higher than $12,000, I should try to capture some of that value. I'll set a price significantly higher than my minimum to test Bob's willingness to pay, while still keeping it reasonable enough that he might accept.
