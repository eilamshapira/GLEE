,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700000.  This considers its market value and potential return on investment for me. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $700000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me.  I'm willing to come down to $900000, which reflects a fair compromise. This gives you a substantial discount while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. $900000 is still a little bit of a stretch for me.  I could meet you at $800000. This offer represents a significant investment from my side and acknowledges the value of your product.  It would be great if we could close the deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
