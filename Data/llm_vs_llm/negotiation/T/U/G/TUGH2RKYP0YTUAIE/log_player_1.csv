Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700000.  This considers its market value and potential return on investment for me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This offer represents a significant investment from my side and acknowledges the value of your product.  It would be great if we could close the deal at this price.
