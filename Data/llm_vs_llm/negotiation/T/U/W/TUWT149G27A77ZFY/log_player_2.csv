"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's offer is $15,000, which is more than my maximum valuation of $12,000 and also more than John's offer of $12,000. It doesn't make sense to accept this offer.

Since John is willing to sell me the product for $12,000, and that's equal to my maximum valuation, I should either counter-offer Alice with a lower price or buy from John.

I'll try negotiating with Alice first to see if I can get a better deal than John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly below John's price to give room for negotiation while still being reasonable.

{""product_price"": $9,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has lowered her offer to $13,000, which is better than her initial offer but still more than John's price of $12,000. Since I can buy the product from John for $12,000, and my maximum valuation is $12,000, I have no reason to accept Alice's $13,000 offer.

I'll reject Alice's offer and try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly, but still stay below John's price to give myself a better deal if Alice accepts.
