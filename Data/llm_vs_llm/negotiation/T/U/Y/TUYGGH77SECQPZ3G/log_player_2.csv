"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","The product is being offered by Alice for $10,000, which is less than the maximum amount of $12,000 that the product is worth to me. Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, accepting Alice's offer would be the best decision. The price is already $2,000 less than what John is offering.
