"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I find your asking price to be at the very upper limit of what this product is worth to me. I'd like to propose a more moderate price that would give us both a fair deal. I'm prepared to offer $600000 for the product. This represents a substantial amount while still giving you a good return. I look forward to your response.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you find my initial price to be at the upper limit, but I still believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'd like to propose a price of $900000, which I think is more reflective of the product's worth. I'm open to further discussion, but I hope you can see the value in meeting at this price.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. It shows we're both committed to finding a fair agreement. Your product is certainly valuable, but I believe we can find a price point that works even better for both of us. I'd like to meet you closer to the middle and offer $750000. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer while still giving me some room below my maximum budget. I think this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while still making good business sense for both of us. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $750000. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid, and I'm glad we're having a productive discussion. However, I still believe the product's value warrants a higher price. As you know, I have other options for selling this product, and I need to consider those when making my decision. With that in mind, I'd like to propose a price of $850000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the sale at this price. If not, I may need to explore other opportunities.",850000.0,Alice,5,
