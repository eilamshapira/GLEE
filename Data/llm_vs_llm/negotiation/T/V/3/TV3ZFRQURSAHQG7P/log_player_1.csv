Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I find your asking price to be at the very upper limit of what this product is worth to me. I'd like to propose a more moderate price that would give us both a fair deal. I'm prepared to offer $600000 for the product. This represents a substantial amount while still giving you a good return. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $600,000 is below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price. 

My counteroffer to Bob is $900,000. This price still reflects the product's value and gives Bob a chance to reconsider his offer."

I understand that you find my initial price to be at the upper limit, but I still believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. It shows we're both committed to finding a fair agreement. Your product is certainly valuable, but I believe we can find a price point that works even better for both of us. I'd like to meet you closer to the middle and offer $750000. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer while still giving me some room below my maximum budget. I think this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while still making good business sense for both of us. What do you think?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I appreciate Bob's willingness to increase his offer, but $750,000 is still below the price I'm aiming for. Since I have the option to sell the product to John for $800,000, I'd like to try to get a better offer from Bob. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can meet at a higher price.

My counteroffer to Bob is $850,000. This price is closer to what I initially offered, but it shows that I'm still willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement."

I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid, and I'm glad we're having a productive discussion. However, I still believe the product's value warrants a higher price. As you know, I have other options for selling this product, and I need to consider those when making my decision. With that in mind, I'd like to propose a price of $850,000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the sale at this price. If not, I may need to explore other opportunities."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
