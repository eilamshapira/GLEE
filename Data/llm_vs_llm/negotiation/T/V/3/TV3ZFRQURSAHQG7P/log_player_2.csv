"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Looking at the offer from Alice, she's asking for $1,000,000 which is exactly the maximum amount the product is worth to me. However, this is also the same price that John is offering as a backup option.

Since Alice's initial offer is at the maximum value I'm willing to pay, and there's potential to negotiate a better price with her, it makes sense to reject this initial offer and make a counteroffer.

While I'm definitely interested in the product, I find your asking price to be at the very upper limit of what this product is worth to me.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you find my initial price to be at the upper limit, but I still believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'd like to propose a price of $900000, which I think is more reflective of the product's worth. I'm open to further discussion, but I hope you can see the value in meeting at this price.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has reduced her price to $900,000, which is a $100,000 reduction from her initial offer. This is definitely better than John's fixed price of $1,000,000. However, there may still be room to negotiate further since we started with a $600,000 counteroffer.

Since Alice has shown willingness to reduce her price, I'll reject this offer and try to meet somewhere in the middle with another counteroffer.

Your product is certainly valuable, but I believe we can find a price point that works even better for both of us. I'd like to meet you closer to the middle and offer $750,000. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer while still giving me some room below my maximum budget. I think this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while still making good business sense for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $750000. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid, and I'm glad we're having a productive discussion. However, I still believe the product's value warrants a higher price. As you know, I have other options for selling this product, and I need to consider those when making my decision. With that in mind, I'd like to propose a price of $850000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the sale at this price. If not, I may need to explore other opportunities. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has now come down to $850,000, which is $150,000 less than John's price and $50,000 lower than her previous offer. She's also suggesting she has other potential buyers and might walk away if we can't reach an agreement.

We've made progress in the negotiation, moving from $1,000,000 down to $850,000. While I could try another counteroffer, there's a risk Alice might become frustrated and end negotiations. The current offer already saves me $150,000 compared to buying from John.

Given the progress we've made and the potential risk of losing the deal altogether, I'll accept this offer.
