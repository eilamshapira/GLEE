"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than that, especially considering the benefits it will bring you. I'm willing to come down to $1150000.  This is my final offer.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $1150000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. Considering the product's value to me and the fact that I have an alternative option from John for $1500000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
