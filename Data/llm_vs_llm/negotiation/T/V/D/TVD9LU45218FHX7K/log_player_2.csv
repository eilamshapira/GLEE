"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $120 is a reasonable starting point, but there's room for negotiation. You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.  You're aiming for under $150, so there's a decent buffer to work with before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer aims to significantly lower the price from Alice's initial offer while still leaving room for further negotiation. It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate but also sets a more favorable price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is coming down, but slowly.  There's still a decent chance of getting the price closer to $100, which would be a great deal. We're not in a rush and John's price acts as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your last offer and her current one. It shows you're willing to compromise but holds a firm position on a good price point."
