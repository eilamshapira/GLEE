"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is higher than both:
1. My maximum valuation ($800,000)
2. John's alternative offer ($800,000)

It would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. I can save $200,000 by buying from John.
