# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. After careful consideration, I've decided on a price that I believe reflects its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1199999. This is an exceptional deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,199,999.
