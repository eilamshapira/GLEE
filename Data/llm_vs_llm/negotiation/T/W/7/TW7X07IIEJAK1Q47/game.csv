"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $2000000 is way out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, after careful consideration, I'm willing to lower my price to $1600000. This is a fair price for the value and quality of the product. I hope we can make a deal at this price.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1600000 is still a bit high for me.  While I understand the product's value, I'm really pushing my budget at $800000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
