"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer of $250 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80), I'll reject this offer. It's much higher than what I'm willing to pay, and I have the option to make a counteroffer or ultimately buy from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 70}

I'll offer $70, which is slightly below my maximum value of $80. This gives me some room for negotiation if Alice counteroffers, while still being a reasonable price considering the product is worth $150 to her. If Alice rejects this and subsequent negotiations don't work out, I can always fall back on John's offer at $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $220. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $220
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $220 is still way above my maximum value of $80. Even though she reduced the price from her initial offer of $250, it's still not close to what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer. If we can't reach an agreement soon, I always have the option to buy from John at $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 75}

I'll slightly increase my previous offer to $75. This shows some willingness to negotiate while still staying below my maximum value of $80. The price is also reasonable for Alice since it's still a decent margin above her cost of $150. However, if Alice continues to make high counteroffers, I can always fall back on John's offer of $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Here's why:
1. Alice's offers, while decreasing, are still far above my maximum value of $80
2. Alice has rejected my reasonable counteroffers of $70 and $75
3. The price gap between Alice's asks ($180) and my maximum value ($80) is still too large to bridge
4. We've already used half of our negotiation rounds, and progress is too slow
5. John's offer of $80 exactly matches my maximum value and is guaranteed

There's no point continuing negotiations when I can get the product at my maximum acceptable price right now from John."
