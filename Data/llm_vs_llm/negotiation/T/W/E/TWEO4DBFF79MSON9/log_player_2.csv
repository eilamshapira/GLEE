"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $130. I think it would be very valuable to you, and this is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is quite high. I have room to negotiate for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but that price is a little too high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significant but not unreasonable counteroffer. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well below Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $115 is still too high. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""It seems like we're getting closer, Alice. How about $100? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:** I am nudging the price closer to a reasonable point while still demonstrating willingness to negotiate.  Alice is likely to counter again, and this keeps the conversation moving."
