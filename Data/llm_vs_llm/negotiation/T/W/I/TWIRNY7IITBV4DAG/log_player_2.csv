"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its rarity and the significant benefits it offers, I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. I'm offering it to you today for $22000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering the product for $22,000
3. John is offering the same product for $15,000
4. If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John

This is a straightforward decision:
- Alice's offer ($22,000) is significantly higher than my maximum valuation ($15,000)
- John's offer ($15,000) matches my maximum valuation
- There's no reason to pay $7,000 more for the same product
