"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my premium product to you for $18,000. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a lower price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

# Explanation:
# I reject the offer because $12,000 is too low compared to my initial asking price of $18,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, so I want to counteroffer with a higher price to potentially increase my profit. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I think I can get more than $10,000 from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $15,000. This way, we both make some concessions."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
