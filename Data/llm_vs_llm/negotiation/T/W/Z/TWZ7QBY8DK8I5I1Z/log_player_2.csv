"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This price ($1,800,000) is above my maximum value of $1,500,000, and it's also higher than John's offer. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation, but not too low to be taken seriously.

{""product_price"": 1000000}

This offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer and John's price, giving room for negotiation while still being a reasonable starting point. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground that's below my maximum value of $1,500,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer of $1,500,000. Here's why:
1. It matches my maximum value of $1,500,000
2. It equals John's price, so there's no advantage in switching to John
3. Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer of $1,800,000
4. Further negotiation might risk losing the deal, and we're unlikely to get a significantly better price since we already reached my target price point."
