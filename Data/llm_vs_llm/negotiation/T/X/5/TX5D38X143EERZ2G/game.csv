"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its market value and potential returns, I'm offering it at $1300000. This price reflects the product's quality and long-term value.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point you've presented is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product. This offer reflects a fair price considering current market conditions.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must point out that this product's true value is significantly higher. I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down from my initial price, but $850000 is too close to my bottom line. I can offer it for $1150000, which I believe is a fair price considering the $1500000 value you'll be able to generate from it.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still interested in the product, but $1150000 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $975000?  This offer reflects a fair balance between its value and my investment capabilities.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your movement toward a middle ground, and I see we're making progress. However, considering the substantial value this product will generate for you, I believe we can find a more equitable price point. I'm willing to come down to $1075000, which still leaves you with significant upside potential given the product's value to your business.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for continuing this negotiation. I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with. To be completely transparent, I've set a maximum budget of $1000000 for this purchase.  If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
