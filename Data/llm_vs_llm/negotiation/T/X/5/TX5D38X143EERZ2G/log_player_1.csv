"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its market value and potential returns, I'm offering it at $1,300,000. This price reflects the product's quality and long-term value."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point you've presented is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product. This offer reflects a fair price considering current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer in the next round. $850,000 is too close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and I know the product is worth significantly more to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must point out that this product's true value is significantly higher. I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down from my initial price, but $850,000 is too close to my bottom line. I can offer it for $1,150,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the $1,500,000 value you'll be able to generate from it."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still interested in the product, but $1150000 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $975000?  This offer reflects a fair balance between its value and my investment capabilities. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make another counteroffer. While Bob's offer has improved significantly, there's still room for negotiation given that the product is worth $1,500,000 to him. $975,000 would leave too much value on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your movement toward a middle ground, and I see we're making progress. However, considering the substantial value this product will generate for you, I believe we can find a more equitable price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which still leaves you with significant upside potential given the product's value to your business."", ""product_price"": 1075000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for continuing this negotiation. I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with. To be completely transparent, I've set a maximum budget of $1000000 for this purchase.  If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,000,000. This represents a good compromise and a significant improvement from his initial offer. While it's not as high as I initially hoped, it's a 25% improvement over my minimum price of $800,000, and Bob has indicated this is his maximum budget. Given we're in round 6 of 10, and there's a risk of Bob walking away, this is a reasonable outcome for both parties."
