"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer ($20,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000), it would not be rational to accept this offer. Additionally, since I can guarantee getting the product from John for $10,000, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice when her opening offer is so high. The best decision would be to buy from John.
