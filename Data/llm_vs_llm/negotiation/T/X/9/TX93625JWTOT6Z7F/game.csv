"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to buy from you. However, $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to go down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $95 might be a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of meeting in the middle. How about we settle on $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
