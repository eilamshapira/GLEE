Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to buy from you. However, $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to go down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $85 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($80), but lower than my initial offer, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $95 might be a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of meeting in the middle. How about we settle on $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to split the difference with you at $87.50. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $87.50 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($80), and it's getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with, I'll choose to accept Bob's offer. It's a reasonable compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by pushing for a higher price.
