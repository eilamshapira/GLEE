Since I have John's guaranteed offer of $10,000, there's no reason to accept anything lower than that. However, I'll continue negotiating with Bob as there's still potential to get a better price than John's offer.

While Bob is gradually increasing his offers, we're past the halfway point in our negotiation rounds, and he's still far from matching John's offer. Given the limited remaining rounds and the large gap between Bob's current offer and John's guaranteed price, I'll take the secure option.
