"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully. She's asking for $18,000, which is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($8,000) and John's alternative offer ($8,000).

Since the product is only worth up to $8,000 to me, accepting Alice's $18,000 offer would be a poor decision as I'd be paying $10,000 more than the product's value to me.

John's offering the product at exactly my maximum valuation ($8,000), which means I'd get no consumer surplus by buying from him, but it's a guaranteed option.

It makes sense to try negotiating with Alice first to see if I can get a better deal than John's $8,000 offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives me room to negotiate while still being somewhat attractive to Alice.

{""product_price"": $4,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has lowered her offer from $18,000 to $15,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still significantly above both my maximum valuation ($8,000) and John's guaranteed offer ($8,000).

Since I'm looking for a product worth no more than $8,000 to me, paying $15,000 would be a poor decision - I'd be losing $7,000 of value. I'll continue negotiating since Alice has shown willingness to reduce her price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer a bit to show I'm negotiating in good faith, but I'll stay well below my maximum value since I have John's offer as a backup.

{""product_price"": $5,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her offer to $13,500, showing she's willing to continue negotiating. However, this is still $5,500 above my maximum valuation and John's offer.

Since I can buy the same product from John for $8,000, which is my maximum valuation, Alice's current offer isn't competitive. I'll continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price below John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer again to show I'm making progress in the negotiation, but I'll make sure to stay below John's price of $8,000.

{""product_price"": $6,500}"
