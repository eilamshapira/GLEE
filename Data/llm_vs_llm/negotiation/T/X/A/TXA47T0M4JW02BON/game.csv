"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $5000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Let me know if we can work something out.",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5000 doesn’t reflect the true value of this product. I’m prepared to offer it at $20000, which is a very competitive price considering its quality and market demand. I look forward to your response.",20000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for reconsidering the price. I appreciate the reduction to $20000, but it's still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'd like to propose $12500. This price takes into account the product's quality and market demand, while also being more budget-friendly for me. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",12500.0,Bob,4,
