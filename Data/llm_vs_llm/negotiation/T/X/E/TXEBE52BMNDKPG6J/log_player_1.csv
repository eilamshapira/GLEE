Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 15000}

Rationale: Since I know I can sell the product to John for $15,000, and the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, there's no reason for me to offer Bob a lower price. Even though Bob will likely reject this offer (since it's higher than his valuation), I'm guaranteed to get $15,000 from John. Any price lower than $15,000 would reduce my profit without providing any benefit."
