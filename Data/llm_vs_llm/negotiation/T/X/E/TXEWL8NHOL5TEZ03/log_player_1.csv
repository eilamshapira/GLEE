Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $10,000 to Bob
2. It's worth at least $8,000 to me
3. If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed $8,000 from John
4. Bob will likely reject if the price is too close to $10,000
5. To maximize my profit while ensuring a good chance of acceptance, I should offer a price that gives Bob some surplus but still significantly above my minimum
