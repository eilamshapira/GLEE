Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me start with a relatively high price to test Bob's willingness to pay, while leaving room for negotiation if needed.

{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $60 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $80, there's no reason to accept Bob's low offer. And since I can always fall back on John's offer, it's worth trying one more counteroffer with Bob before potentially selling to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from the initial $120, but still keep it above my minimum threshold of $80, trying to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Bob.

{""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer ($75) is still below what I can get from John ($80), and Bob's increases in price have been relatively small, it makes the most sense to take the guaranteed $80 from John rather than continue negotiating.
