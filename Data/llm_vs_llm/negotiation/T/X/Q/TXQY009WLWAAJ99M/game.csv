,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $25000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $5000. Would you be willing to consider that?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price. However, the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to lower it to $20000 as a special offer for you. What do you say?",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price to $20000, but it's still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about $12500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down further to $17500. This is a significant discount, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $17500. However, I'm still trying to stay within a tighter budget. Considering your last concession, I'd like to propose a price of $15000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",15000.0,Bob,6,
