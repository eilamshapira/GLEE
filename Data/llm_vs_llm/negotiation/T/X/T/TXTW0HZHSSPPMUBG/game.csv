"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity. This product is truly exceptional and I believe it will be a game-changer for you. Given its immense potential, I'm offering it to you for $2500000. I'm confident you'll see the value.",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I have to be frank - $2.5 million is far above market value for this product. I have another seller offering the same product for much less. However, I'd like to work with you if we can reach a reasonable price. I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product, which I believe is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the $800000 offer significantly undervalues the product. While I can't meet you there, I'm willing to come down from my initial price. How about $2200000?",2200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you reducing your price, but $2.2 million is still far above what I can justify for this product. I want to be transparent - I have a firm offer from another seller for $1.2 million. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a reasonable price. I can increase my offer to $1000000, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have another offer for $1.2 million. Knowing that, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet closer to the middle. How about $1800000?",1800000.0,Alice,5,
