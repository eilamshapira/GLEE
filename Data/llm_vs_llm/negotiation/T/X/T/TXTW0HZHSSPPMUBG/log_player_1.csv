Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I have to be frank - $2.5 million is far above market value for this product. I have another seller offering the same product for much less. However, I'd like to work with you if we can reach a reasonable price. I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product, which I believe is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you reducing your price, but $2.2 million is still far above what I can justify for this product. I want to be transparent - I have a firm offer from another seller for $1.2 million. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a reasonable price. I can increase my offer to $1000000, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
