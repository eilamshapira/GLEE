"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity. This product is truly exceptional and I believe it will be a game-changer for you. Given its immense potential, I'm offering it to you for $2500000. I'm confident you'll see the value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me
2. Alice's offer ($2,500,000) is more than twice my maximum value
3. John is offering the product for $1,200,000
4. While I could try to negotiate with Alice, her initial offer is extremely high

I will reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. There's room for negotiation, and since I have 10 rounds, it's worth trying to get a better deal than John's price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I have to be frank - $2.5 million is far above market value for this product. I have another seller offering the same product for much less. However, I'd like to work with you if we can reach a reasonable price. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the $800000 offer significantly undervalues the product. While I can't meet you there, I'm willing to come down from my initial price. How about $2200000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $2,200,000 is still significantly above my maximum value of $1,200,000 (which is also John's price). While Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing her price by $300,000, she's still far above what I'm willing to pay. Since we still have several rounds left for negotiation, I'll reject this offer and try another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice came down by $300,000, I'll increase my offer but still keep it well below my maximum value to leave room for further negotiation.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you reducing your price, but $2.2 million is still far above what I can justify for this product. I want to be transparent - I have a firm offer from another seller for $1.2 million. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a reasonable price. I can increase my offer to $1,000,000, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have another offer for $1.2 million. Knowing that, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet closer to the middle. How about $1800000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's offer of $1,800,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value and John's price of $1,200,000. While she's showing continued flexibility by reducing her price further, she's still asking for $600,000 more than my alternative option. At this point, I could continue negotiating, but since we've already gone through several rounds and Alice's price is still substantially above John's offer, it might be more prudent to accept John's guaranteed price of $1,200,000.
