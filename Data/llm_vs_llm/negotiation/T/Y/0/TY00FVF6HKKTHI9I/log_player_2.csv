"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2000000. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm open to negotiations if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer of $2,000,000 for the product. 

Let me analyze this situation:
- I'm looking for a product worth no more than $1,000,000 to me
- Alice is offering it for $2,000,000
- I have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000 guaranteed
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can make a counteroffer

Since Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is twice the maximum value the product has to me, and twice what John would sell it for, this offer doesn't make financial sense for me to accept.

I could reject and make a counteroffer, but given that I can buy from John for exactly the maximum value I place on the product, the most logical decision is to go with the guaranteed option.
