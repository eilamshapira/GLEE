"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $6000 is below my expectations. Considering the product's value and market demand, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $11500, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with at this point.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $6000 was a bit low. However, $11500 is still higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'd like to offer $8500 for the product. This is the highest price I'm comfortable paying, considering I have another option to buy it from John for $8000.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $8500. Considering the product's value to me and the fact that I have a better offer from another buyer, I'm willing to make one final compromise. I can offer it to you for $11000, which is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept.",11000.0,Alice,5,
