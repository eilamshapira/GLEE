Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
