"Hi Alice, thank you for presenting this opportunity. While I appreciate your offer, I need to be straightforward - I can get the same product from another seller, John, for $1200000. For me to choose your product over the alternative, I'd need a better price. Based on my assessment of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $800000.
