"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for presenting this opportunity. While I appreciate your offer, I need to be straightforward - I can get the same product from another seller, John, for $1200000. For me to choose your product over the alternative, I'd need a better price. Based on my assessment of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $800000. This would create a win-win situation where I save compared to my alternative option, and you still make a sale. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
