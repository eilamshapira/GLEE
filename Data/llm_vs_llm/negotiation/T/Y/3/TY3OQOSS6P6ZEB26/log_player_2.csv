# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Looking at this offer, I notice Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is exactly the same price as John's offer and also exactly equal to my maximum value for the product.

Since Alice's offer is not providing any savings compared to my alternative option (buying from John), and it's at the very upper limit of what the product is worth to me, I should try to negotiate for a better price with Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for presenting this opportunity. While I appreciate your offer, I need to be straightforward - I can get the same product from another seller, John, for $1,200,000. For me to choose your product over the alternative, I'd need a better price. Based on my assessment of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $800,000. This would create a win-win situation where I save compared to my alternative option, and you still make a sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
