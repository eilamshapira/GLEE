Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""product_price"": 25000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Considering the situation, I have to make a strategic decision. Selling to John guarantees $15,000, which is more than Bob's current offer, but I also have the potential to get a higher price from Bob, especially if he values the product more than my initial minimum value.

Given that I have 8 rounds left and my goal is to maximize profit, I will reject Bob's offer.
