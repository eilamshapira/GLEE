"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'll analyze this situation:

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and John is offering it for exactly $12,000.
Alice's initial offer of $25,000 is more than twice what the product is worth to me.
I should either negotiate with Alice to get a better price or buy from John if negotiation seems unlikely to succeed.

Given that Alice's initial offer is so high, and I have a guaranteed option to buy at $12,000, I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $7,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I see that Alice has only slightly reduced her price from $25,000 to $22,000, which is still significantly higher than the maximum value of $12,000 that the product is worth to me. Given that John is offering the product at exactly $12,000, and Alice's counteroffer remains well above this price, I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $9,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice is still offering the product at $20,000, which is significantly above the $12,000 maximum value to me and John's guaranteed price. Her price reductions are small (from $25,000 to $22,000 to $20,000), suggesting she may not come down to a price below John's offer within our remaining rounds.

Since John's offer of $12,000 is equal to the maximum value I place on the product, and Alice doesn't seem willing to offer a competitive price, I'll buy from John.
