"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the product you're offering, but $25000 is well beyond my budget and the product's value to me. The maximum value this product has to me is $8000, which happens to be the same price John is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. I'm willing to offer $5500 for it. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to your competitor.",5500.0,Bob,2,
