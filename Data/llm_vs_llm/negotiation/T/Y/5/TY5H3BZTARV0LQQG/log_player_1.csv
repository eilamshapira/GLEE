"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I hope you're doing well. I’m offering you my premium product, and it’s available for $25,000. I believe you’ll appreciate its quality and value. I look forward to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the product you're offering, but $25000 is well beyond my budget and the product's value to me. The maximum value this product has to me is $8000, which happens to be the same price John is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. I'm willing to offer $5500 for it. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to your competitor. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
