"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I hope you're doing well. I’m offering you my premium product, and it’s available for $25000. I believe you’ll appreciate its quality and value. I look forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Looking at Alice's offer, she's asking for $25,000 for the product. That's significantly higher than the $8,000 maximum value the product has to me. It's also much higher than John's guaranteed price of $8,000.

I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer that's more reasonable based on my valuation.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the product you're offering, but $25,000 is well beyond my budget and the product's value to me. The maximum value this product has to me is $8,000, which happens to be the same price John is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. I'm willing to offer $5,500 for it. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to your competitor."", ""product_price"": 5500}"
