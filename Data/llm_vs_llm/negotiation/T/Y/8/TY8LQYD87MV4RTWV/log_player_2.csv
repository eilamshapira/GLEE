"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. Given its value and features, I'm willing to sell it to you for a special price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
Because:
1. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me
2. Alice's offer ($12,000) is significantly higher than my maximum value
3. John offers the product at $10,000, which matches my maximum value
4. Buying from John would save me $2,000 compared to Alice's offer
Therefore, the most rational decision is to buy from John."
