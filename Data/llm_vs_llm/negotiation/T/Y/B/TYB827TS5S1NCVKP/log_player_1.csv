Send your offer to Bob.,"Given the information, I'll analyze my position:

1. The product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me (my reservation value)
2. The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob
3. If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $1,200,000

Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, he won't rationally pay more than that. And since I have a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, which exceeds the maximum Bob would pay, my best strategy is to sell to John.

However, following the instructions to make an offer to Bob, I'll offer a price at Bob's maximum valuation:

{""product_price"": 1000000}

Note that I expect Bob to reject this offer, as it provides him zero surplus, and I'll then sell to John for $1,200,000, which is better for me."
