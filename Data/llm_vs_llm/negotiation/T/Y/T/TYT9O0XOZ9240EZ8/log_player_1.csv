"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is lower than the minimum value of $12,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $12,000, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I am willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

My counteroffer is $18,000.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is still lower than my previous counteroffer, but closer to the minimum value that I'm willing to accept ($12,000), I will reject Bob's offer again. However, I will also try to be more realistic in my expectations, considering that Bob is not willing to meet my previous counteroffer.

My next counteroffer will be $15,000.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my new counteroffer is: {""product_price"": 15000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

However, I will try to meet Bob halfway and make a more reasonable counteroffer.

My next counteroffer will be $12,500.

So, my decision is:

And my new counteroffer is: {""product_price"": 12500}"
