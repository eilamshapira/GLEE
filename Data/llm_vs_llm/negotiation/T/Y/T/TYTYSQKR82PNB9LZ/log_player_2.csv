"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value is $1,200,000
2. Alice's offer is $1,100,000, which is below my maximum
3. John's fixed price is $1,200,000
4. Alice's cost is $800,000, so there's room for negotiation

Since Alice's offer is already $100,000 less than John's price, it's a decent starting point. However, given that Alice's cost is $800,000, there's potentially room to negotiate for a better price. It's only the first round, so I should try to negotiate for a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice's cost is $800,000 and my maximum is $1,200,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial $1,100,000 offer, but still provides her with a reasonable profit margin.

I'll propose a price of $900,000, which would give Alice a $100,000 profit while saving me $300,000 compared to John's price. This leaves room for negotiation if Alice counters.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let's analyze Alice's new offer:

1. Alice has reduced her price from $1,100,000 to $1,000,000
2. This is a $200,000 savings compared to John's price
3. Alice has moved $100,000 down from her initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate
4. We're only in round 3 of 10, so there's still room for negotiation
5. However, $1,000,000 is a significant improvement and represents a reasonable middle ground (giving Alice $200,000 profit while saving me $200,000)

While we could continue negotiating, Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is quite reasonable. She's shown good faith by making a substantial reduction, and the price point gives both parties a fair deal. Further negotiation might risk losing this good offer, and we might not get a significantly better price.
