"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $1,200,000
2. John's price is $1,200,000
3. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me

Since Alice's offer ($1,200,000) is equal to both:
- The maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,200,000)
- John's alternative price ($1,200,000)

There's no financial advantage in choosing one option over another. All options will cost me the same amount. In this case, I might as well accept Alice's offer since it's already on the table.
