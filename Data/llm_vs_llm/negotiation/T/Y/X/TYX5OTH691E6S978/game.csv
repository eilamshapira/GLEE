"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I know this product is available from John for $150. I'd prefer to buy from you, but I can't pay more than what I can get elsewhere. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product, which would save me some money while still giving you a sale. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is too low for me. I understand you're on a budget, how about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. However, I still can't justify paying $160 when John is offering the same product for $150. If you can beat that price and sell it to me for $140, I'd be happy to buy from you instead of going to John.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price for this product. $150 is my absolute lowest price.  I'd much rather sell it to you than deal with another buyer, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",150.0,Alice,5,
