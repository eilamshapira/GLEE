# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice is offering the product for $200, which is more than the $150 it's worth to me, and I can buy the exact same product from John for $150, I should not accept this offer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that gives Alice an incentive to sell to me rather than losing the sale entirely.

You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's offer of $160 is still higher than John's price of $150. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible while buying the product, and John's price is $10 cheaper, I should not accept this offer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. However, I still can't justify paying $160 when John is offering the same product for $150.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price for this product. $150 is my absolute lowest price.  I'd much rather sell it to you than deal with another buyer, but I'm not willing to go any lower.

You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice is now offering the product for $150, which is the same price that John is offering. Since both options would cost me the same amount, and there's no monetary advantage to buying from either seller, I'll accept Alice's offer.
