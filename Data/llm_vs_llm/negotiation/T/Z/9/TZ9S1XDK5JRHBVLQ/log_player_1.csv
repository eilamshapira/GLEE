Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price to offer Bob. Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll need to balance between setting a price high enough to maximize my profit, but not so high that Bob rejects the offer.

If Bob rejects my offer, I still have John's guaranteed $800,000. This means my offer to Bob should be above $800,000 to ensure I make more than my fallback option.

I'll set the price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value, but still at a level that could be reasonable for a valuable product.
