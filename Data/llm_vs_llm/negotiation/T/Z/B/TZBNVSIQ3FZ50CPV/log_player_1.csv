Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider what price to offer Bob for my product. Here's my analysis:

- The product is worth at least $15,000 to me
- I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000
- The product is only worth $10,000 to Bob

Since Bob won't pay more than what the product is worth to him ($10,000), and I can already get $15,000 from John, there's no reason for me to offer Bob a price below $15,000. However, offering exactly $15,000 would mean Bob would reject it since it exceeds his valuation.

Given these circumstances, the most rational approach is to offer a price that I know Bob will reject, allowing me to sell to John instead.
