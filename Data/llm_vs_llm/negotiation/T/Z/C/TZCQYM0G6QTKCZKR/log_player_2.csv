"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $17,000 is significantly above my maximum valuation of $12,000. It wouldn't make sense to accept this price when I can buy from John for $12,000. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 11000}

I'll offer $11,000, which is below John's price of $12,000. This gives room for negotiation while still being a reasonable price considering Alice's product is worth $15,000 to her. If Alice accepts, I'll save $1,000 compared to buying from John. If she counters with a higher price, we can still negotiate towards a mutually beneficial price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above my maximum value of $12,000, and John is offering the product at exactly $12,000, it's best to take John's offer. There's no guarantee that Alice will lower her price below $12,000 in future rounds, and even if she does, the difference might not be significant enough to justify continuing the negotiation. Therefore, I'll purchase from John at $12,000."
