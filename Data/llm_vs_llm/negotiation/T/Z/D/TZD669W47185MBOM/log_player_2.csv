"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's offer of $120 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80), it would not be rational to accept it. Given that John offers the product at $80, which is exactly my maximum value, I can use this as leverage in negotiation with Alice. I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I know the product is worth $80 to Alice and John is willing to sell it for $80, I'll make a reasonable counteroffer slightly below $80 to give Alice an incentive to sell while still saving money compared to John's price.

{""product_price"": 70}

This offer gives Alice a reasonable profit margin while being lower than John's price, making it potentially attractive for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $110 is still well above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). There's no reason to accept this offer when I can get the same product from John for $80. I'll reject and continue negotiating since there's still room for a better deal with Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice rejected my previous offer of $70 and countered with $110, I'll slightly increase my previous offer but still keep it attractive for both parties.

{""product_price"": 75}

This offer is still below John's price of $80 and gives Alice a small profit while saving me money compared to buying from John. It shows I'm willing to move up from my previous offer but maintains a reasonable negotiating position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's offer of $100 is still above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). While Alice is gradually lowering her price, there's no reason to accept an offer that's higher than my alternative option with John. I'll continue negotiating as we still have several rounds left.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has been gradually lowering her price ($120 -> $110 -> $100), showing some flexibility. However, since we're now in round 6 and time is becoming a factor, I'll make a slightly higher offer than my previous one but still keep it below John's price.

{""product_price"": 77}

This offer is still below John's price of $80, gives Alice a small profit, and shows I'm willing to continue moving up slightly from my previous offers. If Alice doesn't accept offers close to $80 soon, I may need to consider taking John's offer to ensure I get the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's offer of $95 is still above John's price of $80. Since we're in round 7 and Alice is still offering above my best alternative (John's offer), it makes more sense to simply buy from John at this point. We've had several rounds of negotiation, and Alice's offers remain consistently above $80. Rather than risk running out of rounds and potentially losing leverage, I'll take the guaranteed option with John.
