"Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offered price of $175 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $100, and it's also higher than John's price of $100. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to Alice, knowing I can always fall back to John's offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 80}

I'll offer $80, which is below my maximum value of $100. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially allowing me to save money compared to John's price of $100. Since the product is worth $150 to Alice, there might be room to find a mutually beneficial price between $80 and $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's new offer of $165 is still significantly above my maximum value of $100, and she has only reduced the price by a small amount from her initial offer of $175. Given that John is offering the product at $100 (which equals my maximum value), and Alice seems unlikely to reduce her price below $100 based on her negotiation pattern, it's best to end the negotiation and buy from John."
