Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Okay, considering my options and aiming to maximize profit, I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 9200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Okay, this is a crucial point. I need to weigh the risk/reward. Bob is still offering above what I'm guaranteed with John ($8,000), but I want to push for more. However, the longer I negotiate, the more likely Bob is to walk away, and I'll be stuck with the $8,000 from John.

I'll take the deal.
