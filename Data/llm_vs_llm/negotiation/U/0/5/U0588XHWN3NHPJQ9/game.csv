"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer but I'm afraid $15000 is too high for me. I know that John is selling the same product for $10000, so I could get it from him instead. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider selling it for $9500? This would save me some money compared to John's price while giving you a sale that you might otherwise lose.",9500.0,Bob,2,
