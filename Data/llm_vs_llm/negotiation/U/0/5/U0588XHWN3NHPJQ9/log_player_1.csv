Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $15,000. Let me know if you'd like to move forward."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer but I'm afraid $15000 is too high for me. I know that John is selling the same product for $10000, so I could get it from him instead. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider selling it for $9500? This would save me some money compared to John's price while giving you a sale that you might otherwise lose. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
