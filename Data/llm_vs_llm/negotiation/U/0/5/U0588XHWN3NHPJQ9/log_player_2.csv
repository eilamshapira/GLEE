"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $15000. Let me know if you'd like to move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Based on the information provided, I shouldn't accept Alice's offer of $15,000 because:

1. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me
2. I have an alternative option to buy the exact same product from John for $10,000

Alice is asking for $5,000 more than what the product is worth to me and $5,000 more than what I would pay to John. There's no reason to pay this premium.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer but I'm afraid $15,000 is too high for me. I know that John is selling the same product for $10,000, so I could get it from him instead. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider selling it for $9,500? This would save me some money compared to John's price while giving you a sale that you might otherwise lose."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
