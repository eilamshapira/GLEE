"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000 and even higher than John's fixed price. It would be better to either negotiate for a lower price or buy from John if we can't reach a reasonable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than John's price to give room for negotiation, but still reasonable.

{""product_price"": 6000}

I'm offering $6,000 because:
1. It's below my maximum value of $8,000
2. It's lower than John's price of $8,000, giving me potential savings
3. It leaves room for negotiation if Alice counters
4. If Alice rejects, I still have the option to go to John"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still well above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000). While Alice has reduced the price significantly from her initial offer, it's still not competitive with my alternative option. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, but if we can't get closer to a reasonable price, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 7000}

I'm offering $7,000 because:
1. It's a meaningful increase from my previous offer of $6,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. It's still below both my maximum value and John's price of $8,000
3. If Alice rejects this, I still have the option to go to John
4. It demonstrates I'm willing to move up in price, but not to the extent Alice is asking"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John for $8,000 because:
1. Alice's offers are consistently remaining well above John's price of $8,000
2. While Alice is reducing her price, the rate of reduction suggests we're unlikely to reach a price below $8,000 within the remaining rounds
3. My maximum value is $8,000, and John's offer exactly matches this
4. There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will result in a better deal
5. We've already used half of our available rounds, and Alice hasn't come close to a competitive offer

It's more prudent to take the guaranteed option with John rather than continue negotiations that may not lead to a better outcome."
