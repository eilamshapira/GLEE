"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $150
2. The product is worth $150 to me (maximum I'm willing to pay)
3. John's fixed price is $150
4. My goal is to save money

Since all prices are exactly $150, and there's no opportunity to save money with any option, I might as well accept Alice's offer since it's equivalent to the other options.
