"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering $140
2. My maximum value is $150
3. John's price is $150
4. I have 10 rounds to negotiate
5. The product is worth $100 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation

Since Alice's initial offer ($140) is already better than John's price ($150), and I still have 9 rounds to potentially negotiate an even better price, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product costs Alice $100, and I know I can always get it for $150 from John, I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's above Alice's cost but significantly below her initial offer of $140.

{""product_price"": 115}

This offer gives Alice a $15 profit margin while saving me a significant amount compared to both her initial offer ($140) and John's price ($150). It's also a reasonable starting point that leaves room for negotiation if Alice counter-offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the situation:
1. Alice has lowered her price from $140 to $130, showing willingness to negotiate
2. This is $20 less than John's price
3. We still have 7 rounds left for negotiation
4. Alice's cost is $100, so there's still room for negotiation
5. She moved down $10 from her initial offer, suggesting some flexibility

Since we still have several rounds left and Alice has shown willingness to reduce the price, I should reject this offer and try to negotiate further down.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice moved down $10 from her initial offer, so I should also show some flexibility by moving up from my initial counteroffer of $115. I'll split the difference between my last offer ($115) and her current offer ($130) to show good faith in the negotiation.

{""product_price"": 122}

This offer:
1. Shows I'm willing to move up from my initial position
2. Still gives me a good saving compared to John's price
3. Provides Alice with a $22 profit margin
4. Leaves room for further negotiation if needed
5. Demonstrates a reasonable middle ground"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let's analyze this situation:
1. Alice has come down from $130 to $127
2. The gap between our last positions has narrowed significantly ($127 vs my $122)
3. This is $23 less than John's price
4. We're now at round 5, halfway through our negotiation rounds
5. Alice is making smaller price reductions, suggesting we're getting close to her bottom line

Given that:
- The gap is now only $5 between our positions
- We're getting a significant savings compared to John's price
- Alice's movements are getting smaller
- We've already gone through half our negotiation rounds
- The risk of losing the deal might not be worth the small additional savings

I'll accept this offer.
