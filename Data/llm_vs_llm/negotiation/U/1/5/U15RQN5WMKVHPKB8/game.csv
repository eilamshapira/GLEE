"Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I understand the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. This price still reflects a significant investment on my part, but it's more in line with my budget. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $900000 is too low. I am willing to come down to $1100000. This is a substantial reduction and represents a fair price for both of us, considering the value you will receive.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and reduce the price to $1100000. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. This price is still a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value I'll receive from the product. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you are trying to get the best possible price, and I appreciate your interest. However, I can't go that low. My bottom line is $1050000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and still feel like I'm getting a fair return on my investment. If you can agree to this, we have a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your transparency about your bottom line. I'm willing to meet you closer to your target price, but I still need to feel like I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to offer $1000000, which is a significant investment for me. If you're willing to accept this price, I'm ready to close the deal today.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
