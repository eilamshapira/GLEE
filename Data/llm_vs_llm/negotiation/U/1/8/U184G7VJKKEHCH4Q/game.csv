"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  The product sounds interesting, but $1200000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer of $900000, but that's still quite below what the product is worth. I've had significant interest in this item, and John has already offered $800000. Given the product's quality and market value, I can come down to $1100000. This is a fair price that reflects its true value while still giving you room to benefit from your investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1100000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for the product. That's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can make this happen.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
