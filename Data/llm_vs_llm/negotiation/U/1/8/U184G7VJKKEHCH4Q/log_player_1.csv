Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer of $900,000, but that's still quite below what the product is worth. I've had significant interest in this item, and John has already offered $800,000. Given the product's quality and market value, I can come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects its true value while still giving you room to benefit from your investment."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
