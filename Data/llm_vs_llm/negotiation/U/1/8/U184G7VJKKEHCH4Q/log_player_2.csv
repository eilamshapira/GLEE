I'm going to reject Alice's offer. While it's at my maximum budget, I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price. There's no harm in trying to get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer of $900000, but that's still quite below what the product is worth. I've had significant interest in this item, and John has already offered $800000. Given the product's quality and market value, I can come down to $1100000. This is a fair price that reflects its true value while still giving you room to benefit from your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice is clearly trying to play me against John. While $1,100,000 is better than her initial offer, I'm still not happy with the price. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can come to an agreement."
