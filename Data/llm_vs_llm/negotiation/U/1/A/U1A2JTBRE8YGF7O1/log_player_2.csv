"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this fantastic product for sale! It's truly a top-quality item. I'm confident you'll love it. My initial offer is: 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice is offering the product for $120, which is $40 more than what it's worth to me ($80). Since John is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $80, which matches my maximum value, there's no reason to accept Alice's higher price. I could make a counteroffer to Alice, but since John's price already matches the maximum I'm willing to pay, I'll go with the guaranteed option.
