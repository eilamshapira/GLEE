"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $14,000 is well above both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's alternative price ($10,000). It would not be rational to accept this offer when I have a better alternative. I'll reject and make a counteroffer to see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice, knowing I always have John's $10,000 offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 8000}

I'll offer $8,000, which is below my maximum value of $10,000 and leaves room for negotiation. Since I know the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, this opening offer might be low, but it gives room for negotiation while still potentially allowing both parties to benefit if we meet somewhere in between. If Alice doesn't accept, we can continue negotiating, and I always have the option to go with John's $10,000 offer if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's alternative price ($10,000). While Alice has come down from her initial offer, there's no reason to continue negotiating or accept this offer when I have a guaranteed better option with John. I'll take John's offer of $10,000, which is at my maximum value point and better than Alice's current offer."
