Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this offer:

1. My minimum acceptable price is $100
2. Bob's value is unknown, but he might value it higher
3. If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed $100 from John
4. I should set a price higher than $100 to maximize potential profit
5. Setting it too high risks rejection, but I have John as a backup
6. A reasonable markup would be 50% above my minimum
