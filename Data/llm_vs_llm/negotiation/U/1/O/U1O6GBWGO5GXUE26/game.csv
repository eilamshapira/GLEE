"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I think $140 is a bit high. Given the market conditions, I would be comfortable paying $130 for the product. This would still give you a good profit margin while being a more attractive price point for me. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I need to consider my costs as well. I can come down to $135, which I think is a fair compromise between your offer and my initial price. This still gives you a good value for a product that's worth $150 to you, while allowing me to make a reasonable profit.",135.0,Alice,3,
