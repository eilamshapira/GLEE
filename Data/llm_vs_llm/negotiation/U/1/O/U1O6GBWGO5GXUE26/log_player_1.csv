Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of value to you. I'm offering it at $140, which I believe is a fair price given the quality and utility of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I think $140 is a bit high. Given the market conditions, I would be comfortable paying $130 for the product. This would still give you a good profit margin while being a more attractive price point for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I need to consider my costs as well. I can come down to $135, which I think is a fair compromise between your offer and my initial price.
