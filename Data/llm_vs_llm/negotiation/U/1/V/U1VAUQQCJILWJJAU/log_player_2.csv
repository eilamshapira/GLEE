"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: $1,100,000
2. Buy from John: $1,200,000
3. Reject and try to negotiate further

Since my goal is to save money while getting the product, and:
- Alice's offer ($1,100,000) is lower than John's price ($1,200,000)
- The price is below my maximum value ($1,200,000)
- I'll save $100,000 by accepting Alice's offer compared to buying from John
