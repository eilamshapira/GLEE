"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be of great value to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $22500. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you like to proceed with the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Based on the information provided, Alice is offering the product for $22,500, which is significantly more than what it's worth to me ($8,000) and also much more than John's offer of $8,000.

Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and I can buy it from John for exactly $8,000, the logical choice would be to buy from John.
