"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to consider that?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in the product, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of meeting in the middle between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I believe the product is worth more than $100, and I'm willing to compromise.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering I can buy the product from John for $120, I'd like to offer $115. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",115.0,Bob,4,
