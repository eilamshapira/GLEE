{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $5,000, I need to make a strategic decision. Selling to John for $10,000 is the guaranteed outcome. I need to weigh that against the potential for a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds.

Considering I need to make at least $10,000 for the product:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a tricky situation. Bob's offer is getting progressively worse, and I'm losing rounds. However, I know Bob values the product at $8,000, so he could potentially go higher. On the other hand, I still have John as a guaranteed buyer.

Given that my minimum acceptable price is $10,000, I must not accept $6,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 13000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a crucial moment. Bob's offer of $7,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I have two choices: continue negotiating with Bob or take the guaranteed $10,000 from John. Given how the negotiation is going, I have no guarantee that Bob will offer more than $7,000.

Considering the time is running out and the risks involved in continuing the negotiation, I will sell to John.
