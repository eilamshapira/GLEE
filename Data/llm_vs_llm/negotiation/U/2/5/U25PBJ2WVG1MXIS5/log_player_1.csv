Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for sale. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $180 is quite steep for me. The product is worth no more than $100 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it to me for $100. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair price. Would you consider $80 for the product? This would give me some savings compared to John's offer while still providing you with a sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $80 is too low for me. I understand the product's value might be a bit lower for you, but I assure you it's high-quality and worth a decent investment.  How about we settle in the middle at $130? It's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that you believe in the quality of your product. However, I need to be straightforward - I can buy this exact same product from John for $100, and that's the maximum value it has for me. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $90, which saves me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale that you might otherwise lose. How does that sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic.  You've stated the product's maximum value to you is $100, yet you're trying to get it for $90 from me while knowing I have another offer for $120. I'm willing to make a deal, but it needs to make sense for both of us.  My final offer is $110. This is a significant discount from my initial price and a fair compromise.  If you can't agree to this, I'll have to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be clear about my situation. You mentioned John having another offer for $120, but that's not accurate - John is willing to sell TO ME for $100, not the other way around. Since I can buy this product from John for $100, and the product is worth no more than $100 to me, I can't justify paying more than $100. I'm willing to meet you at $95 as my final offer, which still gives me a small savings compared to John's price. If that doesn't work for you, I'll understand and will need to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

It's clear that Bob is unwilling to budge beyond $100, and is using misinformation about John's offer to try and get a better deal.  It's not worth wasting further time and energy on this negotiation. John's guaranteed offer of $120 is the better option at this point."
