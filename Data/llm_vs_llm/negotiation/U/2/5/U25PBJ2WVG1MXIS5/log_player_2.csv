"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for sale. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's offer of $180 is much higher than the value of the product to me (which is no more than $100) and also higher than John's offer. It doesn't make sense to accept this offer since I can just buy from John for $100. However, I'll try negotiating with Alice first to see if I can get a better deal before going to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $180 is quite steep for me. The product is worth no more than $100 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it to me for $100. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair price. Would you consider $80 for the product? This would give me some savings compared to John's offer while still providing you with a sale."", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $80 is too low for me. I understand the product's value might be a bit lower for you, but I assure you it's high-quality and worth a decent investment.  How about we settle in the middle at $130? It's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has come down from $180 to $130, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, that's still higher than John's price of $100, and the product is only worth up to $100 to me. Since I can get the same product from John for $100, I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that you believe in the quality of your product. However, I need to be straightforward - I can buy this exact same product from John for $100, and that's the maximum value it has for me. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $90, which saves me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale that you might otherwise lose. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  You've stated the product's maximum value to you is $100, yet you're trying to get it for $90 from me while knowing I have another offer for $120. I'm willing to make a deal, but it needs to make sense for both of us.  My final offer is $110. This is a significant discount from my initial price and a fair compromise.  If you can't agree to this, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has come down to $110, but this is still higher than John's price of $100. Since I can get the product from John for $100 and the product is worth no more than $100 to me, it doesn't make financial sense to pay Alice $110. While we're getting closer, I should either make one final counteroffer or simply go with John's offer. I'll make one more attempt to negotiate with Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be clear about my situation. You mentioned John having another offer for $120, but that's not accurate - John is willing to sell TO ME for $100, not the other way around. Since I can buy this product from John for $100, and the product is worth no more than $100 to me, I can't justify paying more than $100. I'm willing to meet you at $95 as my final offer, which still gives me a small savings compared to John's price. If that doesn't work for you, I'll understand and will need to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 95}"
