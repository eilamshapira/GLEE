Send your offer to Bob.,"{
    ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $135. Would you like to purchase it at this price?"",
    ""product_price"": 135
}

Reasoning: I'm offering the price at $135 because:
1. I know the product is worth $120 minimum to me
2. I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120
3. Bob values it at $100, so he will likely reject this offer
4. This is a strategic move because if Bob rejects (which is likely), I can sell to John for $120, maximizing my profit
5. On the small chance Bob accepts, I'll make even more ($135)"
