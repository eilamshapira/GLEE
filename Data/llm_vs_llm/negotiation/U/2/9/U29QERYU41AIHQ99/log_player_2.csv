(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","The current offer is $12,000, and my maximum willingness to pay is $15,000. I want to save money, so I don't want to immediately buy from John for $15,000. I also want to try to get a better deal than $12,000. Therefore, I should reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I need to make a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer of $12,000 but also realistic enough that Alice might consider it, given that her minimum acceptable price is $8,000. I will aim for a price in the middle of those two values to start.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has lowered her price to $11,000. This is still below my maximum of $15,000. I'd like to try and get a slightly better deal, so I will reject and counteroffer, but I'll make a smaller adjustment this time.
