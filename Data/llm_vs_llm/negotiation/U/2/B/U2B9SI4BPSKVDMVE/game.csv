"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2500000 is significantly above my budget. While I appreciate the product's quality and features, I have alternative options available at much lower prices. I would be willing to offer $900000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering current market conditions.",900000.0,Bob,2,
