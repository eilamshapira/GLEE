Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2500000 is significantly above my budget. While I appreciate the product's quality and features, I have alternative options available at much lower prices. I would be willing to offer $900000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John instead. Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and the large gap between our prices suggests we're unlikely to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. Since John is offering $1,500,000, which meets my minimum price requirement, it's more profitable to take his guaranteed offer rather than continue negotiations with Bob."
