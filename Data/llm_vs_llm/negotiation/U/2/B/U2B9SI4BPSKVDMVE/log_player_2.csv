"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its unique features and market value, I'm offering it for $2500000. This is a competitive price considering the product's quality and potential value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I reject Alice's offer of $2,500,000 because:
1. It's significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,200,000
2. I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $1,200,000
3. I can try to negotiate with Alice for a better price, and if unsuccessful, I can still buy from John

I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a more reasonable price, but I won't pay more than my maximum value of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2,500,000 is significantly above my budget. While I appreciate the product's quality and features, I have alternative options available at much lower prices. I would be willing to offer $900,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering current market conditions."", ""product_price"": 900000}

The rationale for my counteroffer:
1. I'm starting well below my maximum price of $1,200,000 to leave room for negotiation
2. My offer of $900,000 is a significant reduction but still represents a substantial amount
3. I've mentioned alternative options (without specifically mentioning John) to indicate I have other choices
4. I've kept the tone professional and respectful while emphasizing market conditions
5. If Alice rejects this, I still have room to increase my offer while staying under my maximum of $1,200,000"
