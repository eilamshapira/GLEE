Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider what price to offer Bob. The product is worth $150 to Bob, and I can sell it to John for $150 if Bob rejects. Since Bob and I have the same valuation for the product, I should offer a price at $150 - this gives Bob no surplus but doesn't leave him worse off either. If I price higher, Bob would reject the offer.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'd like to offer you this product for $150. This is a fair market price for the item, and I believe it provides good value at this price point. Would you like to purchase it?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
