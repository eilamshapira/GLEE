"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. The product is worth significantly more due to its quality and features. I understand budget constraints, but I need to ensure I'm getting fair value. I can come down to $13500, which is already a substantial discount from my initial offer.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, $13500 is still too high for me. I can go up to $8000, but that's my absolute maximum. This is the best I can do.",8000.0,Bob,4,
