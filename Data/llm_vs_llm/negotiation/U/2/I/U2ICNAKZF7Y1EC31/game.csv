"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Based on its features and market value, I'm offering it to you for $18500. This product has excellent value and I believe this is a fair price. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?",18500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $18500 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $6000 at this time. Please let me know if that's something you'd consider.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $6000 is significantly below the product's value and what I can accept. The product is worth at least $12000 to me (I have another buyer willing to pay that). However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can come down to $16000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have another potential buyer, but $16000 is still well outside my budget. My maximum is $8000, and I can buy a similar product from another seller, John, at that price. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if we can reach an agreement. Would you consider $7000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $7000 is still well below what I can accept, especially when I have a guaranteed buyer at $12000. I understand you're working with a budget, but I need to be fair to myself as well. I can come down to $14000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. This is a quality product that will serve you well. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,5,
