Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $6000 is significantly below the product's value and what I can accept. The product is worth at least $12000 to me (I have another buyer willing to pay that). However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can come down to $16000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $7000 is still well below what I can accept, especially when I have a guaranteed buyer at $12000. I understand you're working with a budget, but I need to be fair to myself as well. I can come down to $14000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. This is a quality product that will serve you well. What do you say?
