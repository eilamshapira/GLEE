"Thank you, Alice, for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this price better reflects the product's value to me, and I'm willing to negotiate from here.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $900000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe it undervalues some of the product's key benefits. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1100000.  I think this price point accurately reflects its value and potential for return.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for reconsidering and coming down to $1100000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To meet in the middle, I'd like to propose $1000000.
