"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique nature and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1200000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is below my maximum budget of $1,500,000, I'm interested in exploring the possibility of getting a better deal. Given that Alice mentions being open to discussing further, it suggests there might be some room for negotiation. Therefore, I'll choose to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the hopes of securing a more favorable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range, considering my maximum budget. This approach allows for a broader negotiation space.

{""message"": ""Thank you, Alice, for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price better reflects the product's value to me, and I'm willing to negotiate from here."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $900000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe it undervalues some of the product's key benefits. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1100000.  I think this price point accurately reflects its value and potential for return. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $1,100,000 is closer to my initial counteroffer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. However, it's still $200,000 above my counteroffer of $900,000. Given that Alice has come down by $100,000 from her initial offer, it suggests flexibility in the pricing. My goal is to save as much money as possible while still acquiring the product.

Considering Alice's movement and my budget constraint of $1,500,000, I'll make another counteroffer that splits the difference between my previous offer and Alice's new offer, aiming to find a mutually acceptable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I'll send a new counteroffer: 

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for reconsidering and coming down to $1,100,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To meet in the middle, I'd like to propose $1,000,000. This price takes into account the product's value and potential return, as you've mentioned, while also considering my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
