Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a price to offer Bob that maximizes my expected profit while considering my fallback option of selling to John for $1,000,000.

Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'll need to make a reasonable offer that:
1) Has a chance of being accepted by Bob
2) Is higher than my guaranteed $1,000,000 from John
3) Isn't so high that Bob will almost certainly reject it

Given that my product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price, I should set a price significantly higher than $1,000,000 when offering to Bob. This way, if Bob accepts, I make more than my guaranteed amount.
