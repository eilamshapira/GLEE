"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $2000000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $2,000,000 against my maximum valuation of $800,000 and John's offer of $800,000.

Since Alice is offering the product for $2,000,000, which is significantly more than my maximum valuation ($800,000) and more than John's offer ($800,000), the best decision is clear.
