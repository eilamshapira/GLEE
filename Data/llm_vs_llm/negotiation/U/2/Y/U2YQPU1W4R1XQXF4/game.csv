"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650000.  What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, I cannot accept $650000 as it's significantly below the product's value. I can reduce my initial asking price to $875000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Would this work for you?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, that price is still a little outside my budget.  Would you consider $725000?  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,
