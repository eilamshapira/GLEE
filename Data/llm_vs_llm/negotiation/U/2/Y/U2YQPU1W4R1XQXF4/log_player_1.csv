Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $950,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I reject Bob's offer of $650,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'll make a new counteroffer.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, I cannot accept $650,000 as it's significantly below the product's value. I can reduce my initial asking price to $875,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 875000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, that price is still a little outside my budget.  Would you consider $725000?  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.

I'll sell to John for $800,000. Bob's offer of $725,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and since John is willing to pay $800,000, that's the better option for me. There's no guarantee that continued negotiation with Bob will result in a price above $800,000, so it's best to take the guaranteed higher amount from John."
