"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and John is offering it at exactly $800,000, while Alice's offer is higher at $900,000, the most rational decision would be to buy from John.
