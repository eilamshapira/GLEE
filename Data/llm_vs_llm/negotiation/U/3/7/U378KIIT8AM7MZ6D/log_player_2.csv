"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer at $10,000
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John at $12,000

Since:
- The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
- Alice's offer ($10,000) is $2,000 less than John's price ($12,000)
- Alice's offer is below my maximum value

The best decision would be to accept Alice's offer as it saves me $2,000 compared to buying from John.
