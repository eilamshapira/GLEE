Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its value."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. I'm interested in the product, but I need to consider my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us. My counteroffer will be $1,100,000. This price is still below what the product is worth to Bob, but higher than his initial counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but also aware of the product's value."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a lower price point, but I also need to consider the product's value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I think we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial price. However, I'd like to make another counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle. I'm thinking of a price that's slightly higher than my previous offer but still lower than yours. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Since Bob's latest counteroffer matches the price I can get from selling to John, and I've already negotiated down to this point, accepting this offer seems like the most reasonable choice. It allows me to conclude the negotiation with Bob on a mutually agreeable term without potentially losing the sale by pushing for a higher price that Bob might not be willing to pay."
