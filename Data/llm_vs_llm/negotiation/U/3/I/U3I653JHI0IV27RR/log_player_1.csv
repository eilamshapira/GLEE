I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering with $17,500. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but a compromise from my initial offer.  I'm hoping this shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm choosing to sell to John for $15,000.  This is a guaranteed sale at a price I'm comfortable with, and I'm not sure Bob will go higher. I'm willing to take the safe option and secure the deal."
