"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $950,000 is below my maximum budget of $1,200,000, I have room to potentially negotiate a better price. Given that this is the first round and I don't know the minimum price Alice is willing to accept, I'll reject the offer to see if I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a conservative counteroffer. Since Alice's initial offer was $950,000, I'll offer a price that is lower but still reasonable, to test Alice's flexibility.

{""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $920,000 is closer to my initial budget limit of $1,200,000, but still below it. Since she rejected my previous counteroffer of $850,000 and increased the price, it suggests she might not be willing to go as low as I initially thought. However, there's still room for negotiation.

I'll reject this offer and try to find a middle ground, hoping to get a better price than $920,000 but closer to my desired range.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice's last offer was $920,000 and she rejected my offer of $850,000, I'll try to meet her halfway. A reasonable counteroffer would be somewhere between $850,000 and $920,000. I'll aim for a price that shows I'm willing to compromise but still looking for a good deal.

{""product_price"": 885000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $900,000 is getting closer to what might be a reasonable compromise, considering she's coming down from $920,000. Since I offered $885,000 and she rejected it, offering $900,000 suggests she's trying to find a middle ground as well.

Given that $900,000 is still below my maximum budget of $1,200,000 and considering the back-and-forth negotiations, I might be close to the best price I can get from Alice. However, I'll think about making one more attempt to see if I can shave off a bit more, but I need to weigh the risk of losing this deal if I push too hard.

For now, I'll reject the offer and make another counteroffer, trying to split the difference between my last offer and Alice's current offer.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $900,000 and my previous offer was $885,000, I'll try to split the difference to see if we can meet in the middle. The midpoint between $885,000 and $900,000 is $892,500. I'll offer this price to see if Alice is willing to accept it, as it's a compromise and shows I'm willing to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
