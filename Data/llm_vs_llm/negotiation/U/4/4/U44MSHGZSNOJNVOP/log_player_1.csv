Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob and $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'll start with a high offer to leave room for negotiation while trying to maximize my profit.

{""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob's offer of $10,000 is better than John's $8,000
2. However, since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's still room for negotiation
3. Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate and has moved significantly from my initial offer

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I believe we can reach a better price point.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob moved from my initial $13,500 to $10,000, I'll also show some flexibility but still try to maximize my profit. I'll split the difference between his offer ($10,000) and my previous offer ($13,500), moving closer to a middle ground.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze the situation:
1. Bob has moved up only $500 from his previous offer
2. The pace of increase in his offers is quite small
3. We're still far from the product's value to him ($15,000)
4. His current offer of $10,500 is better than John's $8,000
5. There's still room for negotiation, but we need to be careful not to push too hard

I'll give it one more try with a counteroffer, as I believe we can still achieve a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob only moved up $500 in his last offer, I'll show a similar level of flexibility to keep the negotiation moving. I'll reduce my previous offer of $11,750 by a comparable margin to demonstrate willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good profit.
