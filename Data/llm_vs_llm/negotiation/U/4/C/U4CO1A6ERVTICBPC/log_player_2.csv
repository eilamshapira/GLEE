"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer ($120) is above my maximum value ($100) and higher than John's price ($100), I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. There's no reason to accept a price that's higher than both my maximum value and my alternative option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 80}

I'll start with a relatively low offer of $80. This gives room for negotiation while still being a reasonable price that's below my maximum value of $100. If Alice rejects this, we can potentially meet somewhere in the middle that's still below my maximum value and potentially below John's price of $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice only reduced her price by $2 (from $120 to $118), which is still well above both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). There's no reason to accept this offer, so I'll reject it and make another counteroffer. If Alice continues to make only minimal concessions, I can always fall back on John's offer of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 85}

I'll increase my previous offer by $5 to show some willingness to negotiate, but still maintain a good position. At $85, this is well below both my maximum value and John's price, leaving room for further negotiation. If Alice continues to make only small concessions, I still have the option to go with John's offer of $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is still offering a price ($115) that's higher than both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). While she's showing some movement in price, the concessions are too small and the price is still not competitive. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer. If we can't reach a reasonable agreement soon, I'll need to consider taking John's offer of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 90}

I'll increase my offer to $90, showing continued willingness to negotiate while still staying well below both my maximum value and John's price. We're now in round 6 of 10, so we're past the halfway point. If Alice doesn't start making more significant concessions soon, I may need to either take John's offer or make a final higher offer closer to $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, it's clear that Alice is unlikely to offer a price at or below $100 (John's price). We're in round 7 of 10, and Alice's offers have only come down from $120 to $112, still well above both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). Rather than continue this negotiation which doesn't seem to be converging to an acceptable price, I'll take the guaranteed option of buying from John at $100."
