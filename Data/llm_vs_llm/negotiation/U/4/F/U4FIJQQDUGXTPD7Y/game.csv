"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12500 is quite high for my budget. I know of similar products available for $10000, but I'd like to work with you if possible. Would you consider $9500? This would help me justify choosing your product over other options.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $9500. I appreciate your willingness to work with me, and I'm glad you see the value in my product. However, I need to get a bit closer to my target price. Considering your mention of similar products at $10000 and your offer, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $11250? This is the lowest I can go while still feeling confident in the product's worth.",11250.0,Alice,3,
