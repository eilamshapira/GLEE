Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12500 is quite high for my budget. I know of similar products available for $10000, but I'd like to work with you if possible. Would you consider $9500? This would help me justify choosing your product over other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to try to get closer to my target price. Since Bob is willing to pay $9,500 and has mentioned similar products are available for $10,000, I'll try to meet him in the middle while still being mindful of my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. My next offer will be $11,250, which is a compromise and shows I'm willing to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $9,500. I appreciate your willingness to work with me, and I'm glad you see the value in my product. However, I need to get a bit closer to my target price. Considering your mention of similar products at $10,000 and your offer, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This is the lowest I can go while still feeling confident in the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 11250}"
