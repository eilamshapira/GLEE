"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'm looking for $12500, which I think is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price offered by Alice ($12,500) is above both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000). It would not be rational to accept this offer. I'll reject and make a counteroffer, as there might be room for negotiation with Alice before potentially going with John's option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12,500 is quite high for my budget. I know of similar products available for $10,000, but I'd like to work with you if possible. Would you consider $9,500? This would help me justify choosing your product over other options."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $9500. I appreciate your willingness to work with me, and I'm glad you see the value in my product. However, I need to get a bit closer to my target price. Considering your mention of similar products at $10000 and your offer, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $11250? This is the lowest I can go while still feeling confident in the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's new offer of $11,250 is still above both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000), it makes the most economic sense to buy from John. While I appreciate Alice's attempt to negotiate and lower the price, I would still be paying $1,250 more than necessary if I accepted her offer. John's price of $10,000 matches my maximum value and is the better deal."
