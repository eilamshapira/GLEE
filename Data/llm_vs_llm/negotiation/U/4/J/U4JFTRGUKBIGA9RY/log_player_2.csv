Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, I'll start with a low counteroffer to see how flexible Alice is.

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $250 is way above my budget. I'm interested, but I can only offer $30."", ""product_price"": 30}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $30 is far too low for this product's value. Given its quality and market value, I cannot go below $200. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's offer is still way too high. I will reject and make a counteroffer.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, Alice is dropping her price, but not nearly enough. Let's try to meet somewhere in the middle, but still prioritizing my budget.

```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value the product, but $200 is still outside my budget. The most I can realistically offer is $50."", ""product_price"": 50}
```"
