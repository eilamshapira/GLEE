"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $11500 is a bit outside my price range. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. Would you be open to that?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate you engaging in the negotiation. While $10500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit over budget at $11000.  I'm willing to go up to $10750.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close! $10750 is tempting. I'm finding it hard to go below $11000, but I value closing this deal with you. Let's split the difference one last time. How about $10875?",10875.0,Alice,5,
