"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its unique value and benefits, I'm confident it will be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $11500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, I can likely get a better price by counter-offering. I want to save as much money as possible, and there are still 9 rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $11,500 is a bit outside my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate you engaging in the negotiation. While $10500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $11000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but there is still room for negotiation.  I'm going to try to get her down to $10,750.  I have 7 rounds left to negotiate, so there's no need to rush."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit over budget at $11,000.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  Let's see if we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close! $10750 is tempting. I'm finding it hard to go below $11000, but I value closing this deal with you. Let's split the difference one last time. How about $10875? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly and is now within my budget. While I could potentially try for a lower price, I risk losing the deal altogether. With only 5 rounds remaining, it's a good time to close the deal and secure a good price."
