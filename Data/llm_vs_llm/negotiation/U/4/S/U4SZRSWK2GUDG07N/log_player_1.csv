"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $130. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob knows the product is worth $150 to him, and my minimum is $80, there's room for a better deal. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still above $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $100 is a bit low for the quality of this product, I can come down to $120. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents good value given the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we split the difference and settle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $110. It's a reasonable compromise that gives both of us a good deal. At $110, I'm making $30 more than what John would pay ($80), and Bob is still getting $40 of value ($150 - $110). Further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether."
