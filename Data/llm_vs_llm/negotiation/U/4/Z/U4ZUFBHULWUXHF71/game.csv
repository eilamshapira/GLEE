"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand budget considerations are important, but I need to emphasize that this product has a significantly higher value than $500000. My bottom line is $800000, which is actually the same price another buyer, John, is ready to pay right now. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Given the premium quality and competitive advantage this product offers, I believe $950000 represents a fair compromise. This is substantially lower than my initial offer and reflects my genuine interest in doing business with you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
"Hi Alice, thanks for your counter. I appreciate the flexibility and understand the value you're highlighting.

I hope we can work together on this basis.",800000.0,Bob,4,
