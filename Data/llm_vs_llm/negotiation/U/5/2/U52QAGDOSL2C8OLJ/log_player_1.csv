"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny of $150, considering its quality and value. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about we settle on $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to spend less, but I'm afraid $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we settle on $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}"
