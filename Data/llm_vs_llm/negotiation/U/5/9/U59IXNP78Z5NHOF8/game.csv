"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $6000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget is a concern. However, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $18000 is still a bit high for me. How about $7000? I think that's a fair price considering my budget constraints.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to reach an agreement. I understand your budget, but I'm also not willing to undervalue the product. Look, I'll offer you a final price of $16000. That's the best I can do.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $16000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7500 as my final offer. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,6,
