Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product I think you'll be very interested in. I'm looking to get $20,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $6000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget is a concern. However, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $18000 is still a bit high for me. How about $7000? I think that's a fair price considering my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I still think I can get more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter again.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to reach an agreement. I understand your budget, but I'm also not willing to undervalue the product. Look, I'll offer you a final price of $16,000. That's the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $16000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7500 as my final offer. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","This is getting tough. $7,500 is still way below what I'm hoping for, and I don't want to waste any more time if I can't get a reasonable price. At this point, I need to consider the opportunity cost of continuing to negotiate versus selling to John for $12,000. I think $12,000 is the better choice.
