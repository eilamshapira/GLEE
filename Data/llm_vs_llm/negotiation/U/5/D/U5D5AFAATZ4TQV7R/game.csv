"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I know the product is worth $1000000 to you, and while I understand you need to make a profit, I think we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1050000, which would give you a reasonable profit while also giving me some savings compared to other options in the market.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price. Your counteroffer shows we're making progress, but I think we can find an even better middle ground. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000. This gives you a substantial $100000 profit while still allowing me some savings. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your continued interest and increased offer. I genuinely value our discussions and am optimistic we can arrive at a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering what the product brings to both of us, I'm willing to meet you partway with a counteroffer of $1130000. This reflects a significant concession on my end while still ensuring the value is acknowledged. I hope this can work for both sides.",1130000.0,Alice,5,
