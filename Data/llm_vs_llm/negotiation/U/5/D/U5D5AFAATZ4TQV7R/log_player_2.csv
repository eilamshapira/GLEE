"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product I believe will add significant value to you. Considering its worth and the potential benefits it brings, I'm offering it to you for $1200000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer because Alice is asking for $1,200,000, which is the same price as John's offer. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, there should be room for negotiation to get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try to save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and while I understand you need to make a profit, I think we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000, which would give you a reasonable profit while also giving me some savings compared to other options in the market."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. I understand your perspective, and while your offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1150000. This price reflects the value I believe the product will bring to you and ensures a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer. While Alice has come down from her initial price of $1,200,000 to $1,150,000, there's still room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to her, and my initial offer was $1,050,000, we might be able to meet somewhere in the middle. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price. Your counteroffer shows we're making progress, but I think we can find an even better middle ground. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This gives you a substantial $100,000 profit while still allowing me some savings. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your continued interest and increased offer. I genuinely value our discussions and am optimistic we can arrive at a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering what the product brings to both of us, I'm willing to meet you partway with a counteroffer of $1130000. This reflects a significant concession on my end while still ensuring the value is acknowledged. I hope this can work for both sides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,130,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,130,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer of $1,130,000. While there might still be some room for negotiation, this is a good deal for several reasons:
1. It's $70,000 less than John's price of $1,200,000
2. Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by coming down significantly from her initial price
3. With five rounds already used, continuing to negotiate further risks the possibility of not reaching a deal within the 10-round limit
4. The price gives Alice a reasonable profit while still providing me with meaningful savings"
