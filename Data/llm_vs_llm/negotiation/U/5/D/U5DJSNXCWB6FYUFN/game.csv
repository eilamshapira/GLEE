"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. The product is actually worth about $80 to me, which is the same price I can get it from another seller right now. I'd be willing to buy it from you for $70 to make it worth switching from my alternative option. What do you think?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I can't go as low as $70. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $90. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. However, I can still get this exact product from John for $80, and that's really the maximum value for me. If you can beat that price and offer $75, I'll purchase from you right now instead of going with the alternative.",75.0,Bob,4,
