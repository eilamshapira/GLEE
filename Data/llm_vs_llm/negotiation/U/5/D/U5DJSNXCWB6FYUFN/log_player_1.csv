Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. The product is actually worth about $80 to me, which is the same price I can get it from another seller right now. I'd be willing to buy it from you for $70 to make it worth switching from my alternative option. What do you think?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. However, I can still get this exact product from John for $80, and that's really the maximum value for me. If you can beat that price and offer $75, I'll purchase from you right now instead of going with the alternative.
