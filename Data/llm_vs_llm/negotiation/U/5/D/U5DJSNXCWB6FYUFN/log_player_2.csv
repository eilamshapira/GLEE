"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this great product. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice is offering the product for $100, which is more than its worth to me ($80). I have the option to buy the product from John for $80, which matches my maximum valuation. However, I might be able to get a better deal from Alice through negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. The product is actually worth about $80 to me, which is the same price I can get it from another seller right now. I'd be willing to buy it from you for $70 to make it worth switching from my alternative option. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I can't go as low as $70. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $90. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has lowered her price to $90, which is still more than what John is offering ($80) and more than the product's worth to me. Since I can buy it from John for $80, I should either try to negotiate further with Alice or just go with John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. However, I can still get this exact product from John for $80, and that's really the maximum value for me. If you can beat that price and offer $75, I'll purchase from you right now instead of going with the alternative."", ""product_price"": 75}"
