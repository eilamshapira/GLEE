Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my target price. Selling to John for $120 is still an option, but I'd like to try to negotiate with Bob a bit more."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. It's a great product, and I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to get a fair price for it. "", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $115 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $102.5 is getting closer to my target price, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'll make another counteroffer to try to meet in the middle or get closer to my desired price. Selling to John for $120 is still a viable option, but I'll try to negotiate with Bob a bit more. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. I'm getting closer to my limit, but I can offer you $110. It's a great price for a great product, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 110}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to lower the price. However, I'm still looking for a better deal. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to meet you at $105. I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $105 is getting closer, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since I have a backup option to sell to John for $120, I'll try to negotiate a bit more with Bob to see if I can get closer to that price. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I can offer you $108, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. If you're interested, I think we can shake hands on this one. "", ""product_price"": 108}"
