"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I know would be a great asset for you. Given its market value and potential returns, I'm offering it at $1150000. This price represents excellent value for a product of this caliber.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1150000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at the moment. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking for a more competitive price. Would you consider $1050000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand you're looking for a more competitive price, $1050000 is too close to my minimum threshold. Given the product's value and potential returns, I can offer it at $1120000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price represents a fair middle ground that would benefit both parties.",1120000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand your position. However, I'm operating within a specific budget. I can offer $1075000. This is my best offer at this time. I believe this price is fair considering the market conditions.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $1075000. This shows we're making progress in our negotiation. However, considering the true value and potential of this product, I can come down to $1100000. This is a very competitive price point that still allows you to realize significant value from your investment. I believe this represents a fair compromise between our positions.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
