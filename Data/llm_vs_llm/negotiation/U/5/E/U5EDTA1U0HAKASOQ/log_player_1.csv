"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I know would be a great asset for you. Given its market value and potential returns, I'm offering it at $1,150,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1150000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at the moment. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking for a more competitive price. Would you consider $1050000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let me send a counteroffer. The current offer from Bob is too close to my minimum acceptable price, and I know the product is worth more to him. There's still room for negotiation to find a better middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand you're looking for a more competitive price, $1,050,000 is too close to my minimum threshold. Given the product's value and potential returns, I can offer it at $1,120,000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price represents a fair middle ground that would benefit both parties."", ""product_price"": 1120000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. However, I'm operating within a specific budget. I can offer $1075000. This is my best offer at this time. I believe this price is fair considering the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make another counteroffer. Bob has increased his offer, showing he has room to negotiate, and the product is worth $1,200,000 to him. We can still find a better middle ground that's more beneficial for both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $1,075,000. This shows we're making progress in our negotiation.

This is a very competitive price point that still allows you to realize significant value from your investment. I believe this represents a fair compromise between our positions."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
