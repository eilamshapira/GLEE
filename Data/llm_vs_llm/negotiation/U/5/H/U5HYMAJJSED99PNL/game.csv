"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8000, considering the market value and my budget. I believe this is a fair price for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget, $8000 is far too low for this item. Considering its unique qualities, I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go that low. How about $18000?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about $10000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
