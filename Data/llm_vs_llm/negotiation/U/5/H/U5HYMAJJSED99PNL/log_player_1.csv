"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. Considering its rarity and the value it brings, I'm offering it to you for $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8000, considering the market value and my budget. I believe this is a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $8,000, which is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, I have to reject it.

Therefore, my decision is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget, $8,000 is far too low for this item. Considering its unique qualities, I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go that low. How about $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's new offer of $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I need to make a decision.

I could try to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm already in the fourth round, and the gap between our prices is still substantial. I risk ending up with a price below $12,000.

Therefore, I'll choose to sell to John.
