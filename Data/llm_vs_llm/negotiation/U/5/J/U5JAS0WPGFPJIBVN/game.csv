Hi Bob! I have an exclusive product that I'm sure you will find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $15000. Let me know what you think!,15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out, but $15000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I actually have another seller, John, who's offering the same product for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a better agreement. I can offer you $8000 for the product. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob! While I understand your position, $8000 is quite a bit lower than my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer you the product for $12000. Let me know if that works for you!",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you bringing your price down, but $12000 is still more than what I can justify paying. John is offering the identical product for $10000, which is actually the maximum value this product has for me based on my needs. To make it worth choosing you over John, I'd need a better price. I can offer $9000, which would save me $1000 compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. Does that work for you?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your understanding, Bob! While I appreciate your offer of $9000, I still can't go that low. How about I offer you the product for $11000? I believe this price reflects the value of the product while being a step closer to your budget. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I see we're getting closer! I appreciate you coming down to $11000. However, I need to be completely transparent - John is offering this exact product for $10000, which is actually the maximum value I've budgeted for this purchase. To make it worth my while to choose you over John, I would need a price below $10000. My final offer is $9500. This gives you a sale and saves me $500 compared to my alternative. Can we make a deal at this price?",9500.0,Bob,6,
