Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out, but $15000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I actually have another seller, John, who's offering the same product for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a better agreement. I can offer you $8000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob! While I understand your position, $8,000 is quite a bit lower than my minimum acceptable price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you bringing your price down, but $12000 is still more than what I can justify paying. John is offering the identical product for $10000, which is actually the maximum value this product has for me based on my needs. To make it worth choosing you over John, I'd need a better price. I can offer $9000, which would save me $1000 compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. Does that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your understanding, Bob! While I appreciate your offer of $9,000, I still can't go that low. How about I offer you the product for $11,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I see we're getting closer! I appreciate you coming down to $11000. However, I need to be completely transparent - John is offering this exact product for $10000, which is actually the maximum value I've budgeted for this purchase. To make it worth my while to choose you over John, I would need a price below $10000. My final offer is $9500. This gives you a sale and saves me $500 compared to my alternative. Can we make a deal at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.
