Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about we settle at $900000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $900,000 is still lower than what I'm aiming for, and I believe the product is worth more to Bob. Selling to John for $800,000 is also not ideal, as it's the minimum value I'm willing to accept, and I think I can get a better deal with Bob."

I'll make another counteroffer. While $850,000 is closer to my target, it's still lower than what I'm aiming for. Since Bob is willing to negotiate, I'll try to meet him halfway again. Selling to John for $800,000 is still not ideal, as Bob's offer is higher, and I think we can reach a better agreement. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer of $1,000,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer, and also takes into account that the product is worth $1,500,000 to him.

I'll make another counteroffer. While $860,000 is higher than Bob's previous offers, it's still lower than what I'm aiming for. Since we're running out of rounds, I'll try to make a more aggressive counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. Selling to John for $800,000 is still not ideal, as Bob's offer is higher, and I think we can reach a better agreement.
