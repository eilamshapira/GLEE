Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a premium product that I believe would be perfect for you.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $25000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can offer $5000 for it. Let me know if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer to Bob. $5,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but since Bob showed interest, I'll try to negotiate to find a middle ground.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your interest, Bob. However, $5,000 is too low for this product's value. I can offer it to you for $20,000, which is a reduction from my initial price. Would this work better for you?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the discount, Alice, but $20000 is still more than I am willing to spend. I can increase my offer to $6000. Let me know if we can reach an agreement.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

I will sell to John for $15,000. Bob's offers ($5,000 and $6,000) are well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and his small increase in offer ($1,000) suggests he's not likely to reach a price point that would be acceptable to me. John's guaranteed offer of $15,000 is the better business decision."
