"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Given the situation, I will **Reject Bob's offer**. My floor is $1,000,000, and his offer is below that.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","This is a tough one! Bob is now offering my minimum acceptable price. I need to consider a few things:

*   **Risk:** Continuing the negotiation runs the risk that Bob will lower his offer, or that he will get fed up and walk away.
*   **Reward:** There's a chance I could get a higher price from Bob if I push further, but it's not guaranteed.
*   **Certainty:** Selling to John guarantees $1,000,000 right now.

Since the offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price, and the risk of getting less is greater than the potential reward, I will **Accept Bob's offer**.
