"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,200,000 (which is also John's price). It would be better to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. Even if negotiations with Alice fail, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 900000}

I'll start with a relatively low counteroffer of $900,000. This gives room for negotiation while being significantly below both John's price ($1,200,000) and Alice's initial offer ($1,500,000). This way, even if Alice counters with a higher price, we might be able to meet somewhere in the middle at a price that's better than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice only reduced her price by $100,000, and $1,400,000 is still significantly above John's price of $1,200,000. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer. Since Alice didn't come down much from her initial price, I'll need to continue negotiating. Even if negotiations don't work out, I still have John's offer as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'll increase my previous offer by $100,000 to show some flexibility in negotiation, but still maintain a price point well below John's price. This gives Alice room to counter while keeping the negotiation moving in a constructive direction. If Alice is willing to negotiate reasonably, we might be able to reach a price that's better than John's $1,200,000 offer. If not, I still have several rounds left and can always fall back on John's offer."
