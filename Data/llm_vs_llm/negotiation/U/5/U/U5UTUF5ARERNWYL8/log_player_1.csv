Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. 

Since I know:
1. The product is worth $15,000 to Bob
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $15,000
3. Bob can only accept or reject my offer

I can try to get more than $15,000 from Bob, since that's what he values it at. Even if he rejects it, I won't lose anything as I have John's guaranteed offer.
