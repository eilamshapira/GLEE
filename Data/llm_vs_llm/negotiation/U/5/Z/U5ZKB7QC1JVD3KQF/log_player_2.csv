"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think about this:
1. Alice offers $140
2. The product is worth $150 to me
3. I can always buy from John at $150
4. I still have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Alice
5. Since Alice's cost is $120, there's room for negotiation

The current offer of $140 is better than John's $150, but I believe I can get a better deal from Alice. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice's cost is $120 and the product is worth $150 to me, I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's closer to Alice's cost but still gives her some profit. I'll start with a lower price to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 125}

This offer would give Alice a $5 profit while saving me $25 compared to John's price. Even if Alice rejects this, we can negotiate towards a middle ground that's still better than $140."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice has lowered her price from $140 to $135
2. This shows she's willing to negotiate
3. $135 is $15 less than John's price
4. However, since her cost is $120, there might still be room for a better deal
5. We still have 7 more rounds to negotiate

While $135 is a decent offer, I think there's still potential to get a slightly better price. I'll reject and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice came down $5 from her initial offer, showing she's willing to negotiate. I'll raise my previous offer of $125 to show good faith in the negotiation, but still try to get a better deal than $135.

{""product_price"": 130}

This offer splits the difference between her cost ($120) and her last offer ($135). It would give her a $10 profit while still saving me $20 compared to John's price. It's a fair compromise that should be attractive to both parties."
