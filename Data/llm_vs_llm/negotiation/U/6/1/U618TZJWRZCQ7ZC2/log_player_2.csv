Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but I'm afraid $9000 is too low for this product. Its value to me is at least $12000, which is what another buyer, John, is currently willing to pay. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can offer it to you for $15000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. Would this work with your budget?
