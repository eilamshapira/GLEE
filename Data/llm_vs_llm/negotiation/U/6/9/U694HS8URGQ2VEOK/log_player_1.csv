Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   I'm starting high, above both my minimum acceptable price ($120) and Bob's perceived value ($80).
*   This allows me room to negotiate downwards if necessary, while still aiming for a significant profit.
*   If Bob immediately accepts, I've secured a great deal.
*   If he rejects, I can gauge his willingness to negotiate and adjust my strategy accordingly.
*   I need to keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $120. So my offers cannot allow me to earn less than $120."
