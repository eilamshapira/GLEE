"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer ($15,000) is higher than both the maximum value I'm willing to pay ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000), it wouldn't be rational to accept this offer. Between options 2 and 3, buying from John guarantees me the product at my maximum acceptable price, while making a counteroffer to Alice might lead to a better deal but carries the risk of continued negotiation without certainty. Given that John's price equals my maximum value, the most logical choice is to buy from John.
