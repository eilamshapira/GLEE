"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm pricing it at $13,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth and the benefits it will bring to you."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is too high for me. I am willing to pay $9000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $9,000 is lower than what the product is worth to him ($10,000) and significantly lower than what it's worth to me ($12,000), I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I believe the product's value justifies this price. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the counteroffer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I can go up to $9500, but that's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Although Bob claims that $9,500 is his final offer, I'm not convinced that he won't consider a slightly higher price, especially since the product is worth $10,000 to him. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round to try to get closer to the product's value. If that doesn't work, I can always sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $9,500. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a more significant concession. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is a serious compromise, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
