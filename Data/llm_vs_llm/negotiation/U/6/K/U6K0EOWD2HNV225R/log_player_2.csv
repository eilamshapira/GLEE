"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional quality and the value it can bring to you, I'm confident that it's worth $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000
2. My maximum value for the product is $1,500,000
3. John's fixed price is $1,500,000

Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than both my maximum value and John's price. However, since this is just the first round and I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, I should try to get an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice opened with $1,000,000, which is already a reasonable price, I should make a counteroffer that's not too aggressive but still tries to get a better deal. I'll try to negotiate down by 20%.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, I believe $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget. I would be comfortable paying $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's value is higher than what you've offered. Let's meet in the middle at $900000. This way, we both gain from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The negotiation is progressing well:
   - Alice started at $1,000,000
   - I countered with $800,000
   - Alice has now come down to $900,000

2. Alice is showing willingness to negotiate and has made a significant reduction from her initial price.

3. $900,000 is:
   - $600,000 less than John's price
   - $600,000 less than my maximum value
   - Only $100,000 more than my last offer

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice's offer of $900,000 is already a very good deal. There's a risk that if I push too hard, Alice might become less flexible or raise the price again. Given that this price represents a significant saving compared to both my maximum value and John's price, it would be wise to accept this offer.
