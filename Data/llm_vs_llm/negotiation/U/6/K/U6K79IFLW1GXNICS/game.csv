"Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Considering its unique qualities and potential value to you, I'm willing to let it go for $1900000. This is a significant investment, but one that I believe will yield substantial returns for you.",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but I feel the price is a bit steep. I'm looking to spend no more than $1000000. Let's start the negotiation at $600000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600000 is significantly below what I can accept. Given the value and rarity of the product, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. I'm now prepared to sell it for $1800000. This represents a fair price that reflects its true worth.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I need to stick to my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700000 to meet you in the middle.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I recognize your budget constraints, but I still cannot go that low. To make things a bit more attractive, I'm willing to further reduce the price, but I must stay within a certain range. I'm now offering the product for $1700000. This is the lowest I can realistically go and still feel it's a fair deal.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to raise my offer to $800000 to find a middle ground that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
