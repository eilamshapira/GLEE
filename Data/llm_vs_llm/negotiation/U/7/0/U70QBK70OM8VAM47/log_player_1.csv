Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $2500000 is significantly above my budget and what I believe is the market value. The product is worth no more than $1500000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for exactly that amount. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still providing you with a fair sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for coming down on your price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1800000 is still more than I can justify spending, especially when I have John's offer at $1500000. Since you now know my alternative, there's no reason for me to pay more than that. In fact, to make it worth my while to choose you over John, I need some savings. I'm willing to offer you $1400000, which is a fair price that still gives you a substantial sale while providing me with some benefit for choosing to work with you instead of my alternative option.
