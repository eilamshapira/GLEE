"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique and valuable product that I believe would be a great opportunity for you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2500000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential and features. Would you be interested in making this investment? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000

While I appreciate the quality of your product, $2,500,000 is significantly above my budget and what I believe is the market value. The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for exactly that amount. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still providing you with a fair sale."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your position. However, given that you mentioned the product is worth $1500000 to you, and you have another option at that price point, I believe we can find a middle ground that benefits both of us. I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price significantly and offer the product for $1800000. This price point still provides you with value while reflecting the product's true worth.

However, $1,800,000 is still more than I can justify spending, especially when I have John's offer at $1,500,000. Since you now know my alternative, there's no reason for me to pay more than that. In fact, to make it worth my while to choose you over John, I need some savings. I'm willing to offer you $1,400,000, which is a fair price that still gives you a substantial sale while providing me with some benefit for choosing to work with you instead of my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
