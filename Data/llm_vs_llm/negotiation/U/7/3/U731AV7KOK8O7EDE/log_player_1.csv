Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that the product is worth $1,200,000 to me and $1,000,000 to Bob, I'll start with a high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I don't go below my minimum value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Given that:
1. Bob's offer ($800,000) is significantly below my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000)
2. John is willing to buy the product for $1,200,000, which meets my minimum value
3. Continuing negotiations with Bob is risky as he's starting with a very low offer

The most rational decision is to sell to John, guaranteeing my minimum acceptable value.
