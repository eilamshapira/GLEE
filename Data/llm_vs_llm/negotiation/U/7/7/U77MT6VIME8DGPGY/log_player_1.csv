"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $1,500,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something of great value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $1500000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $800000 to me, which is the price John is offering as well. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $650000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without the need to find another buyer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest in doing business with me, $650,000 is below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 to make this work for both of us. What do you say?""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the value of this product justifies a higher investment. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and should be within a reasonable range for you. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $1250000 is still well above what makes economic sense for me. The product is only worth $800000 to me, which happens to be exactly what John is offering. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I need a better price. I can go up to $700000, which would give you a quick sale and still be $500000 below what the product is worth to you, based on our negotiations so far. This represents a fair middle ground where we both benefit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. However, $700,000 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product at $1,200,000. This is my bottom line, and it ensures that we both get a fair deal. Let me know if you can work with this price.""}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here. Given the value of the product and the urgency of the sale, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,200,000. This is the best I can do, and it matches the offer I have from another buyer. I hope you can see the value in this deal and agree to it."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
