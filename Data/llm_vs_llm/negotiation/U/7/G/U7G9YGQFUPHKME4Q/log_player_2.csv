# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you the product for $11000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it can provide. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering.  You have room to negotiate or move to John's offer."
