"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $900000 is certainly a respectable figure, the true value of this product goes beyond that. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1050000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your enthusiasm. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short of being comfortable with the price. I'd like to propose a compromise of $980000. I believe this is a reasonable price that takes into account the product's value and my budget constraints. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",980000.0,Bob,4,
