Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider this negotiation carefully. My goal is to maximize my earnings, and I know the product is worth at least $12,000 to me. I also have John's offer of $12,000 as a backup.

Since Bob values the product at $8,000, there's no overlap in our valuations that would make a deal mutually beneficial. Any price below $12,000 would be worse for me than selling to John, and any price above $8,000 would not be rational for Bob to accept.

Given this information, I'll start with an offer at the higher end to see if there's any flexibility in Bob's valuation.
