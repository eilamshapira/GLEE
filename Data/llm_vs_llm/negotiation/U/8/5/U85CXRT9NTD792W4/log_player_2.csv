"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive product. Based on its quality and unique features, I'm asking $25000 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Based on the information provided:

1. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to you
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $25,000
3. John will sell you the same product for $10,000

Alice's offer ($25,000) is significantly higher than both the product's value to you and John's price. The rational decision would be to buy from John at the lower price.
