"Hello Bob, I have a wonderful product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $25000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, that price is beyond my budget. I would like to make a counteroffer of $5000 for the product.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $5000 is far too low for this product's value. I can reduce my initial asking price to $22000, which is a substantial discount. Would you consider this more reasonable offer?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the reduction, Alice, but $22000 is still too high for my budget. I would like to make a counteroffer of $8000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you increasing your offer, Bob, but $8000 is still significantly below the product's value. I can come down to $19000, which represents a substantial reduction from my initial asking price. How does this sound?",19000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $19000 is still beyond my means. I would like to counter with a price of $9000 for the product.",9000.0,Bob,6,
