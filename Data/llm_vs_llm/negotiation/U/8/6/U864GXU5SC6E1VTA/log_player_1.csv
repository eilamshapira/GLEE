"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a wonderful product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $25,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, that price is beyond my budget. I would like to make a counteroffer of $5000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll send a counteroffer because $5,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Since Bob came in very low, I'll adjust my price downward but still maintain a strong position.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $5,000 is far too low for this product's value. I can reduce my initial asking price to $22,000, which is a substantial discount. Would you consider this more reasonable offer?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $5,000 is far too low for this product's value. I can reduce my initial asking price to $22,000, which is a substantial discount. Would you consider this more reasonable offer?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the reduction, Alice, but $22000 is still too high for my budget. I would like to make a counteroffer of $8000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob has increased his offer from $5,000 to $8,000, there might be room for further negotiation. However, we're still well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll make another counteroffer with a more significant price reduction to show flexibility.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you increasing your offer, Bob, but $8,000 is still significantly below the product's value. I can come down to $19,000, which represents a substantial reduction from my initial asking price. How does this sound?"", ""product_price"": 19000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you increasing your offer, Bob, but $8,000 is still significantly below the product's value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $19000 is still beyond my means. I would like to counter with a price of $9000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John because:
1. Bob's offers have only increased by small increments ($5k -> $8k -> $9k), suggesting he's unlikely to reach my minimum price of $15k
2. We've already used 6 of our 10 rounds, and the gap is still very large
3. John's offer of $15k is guaranteed and meets my minimum acceptable price
4. The risk of continuing negotiation with Bob isn't worth potentially losing John's certain offer"
