"Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Clearly, Alice's offer of $25,000 is much higher than both my maximum value for the product ($10,000) and John's alternative offer ($10,000). It would be unwise to accept Alice's offer or continue negotiations when I have a guaranteed option to buy at $10,000. Therefore, I'll buy from John."
