"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its market value and potential, I'm offering it at $1800000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and capabilities.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe $1800000 is above my budget for this product. Considering the market value and potential, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $900000 is significantly below the product's value. I have another buyer willing to pay $1200000, but I'm giving you priority as I believe you'd be an excellent client. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1500000, which is a substantial reduction from my first offer. This price better reflects the true value of the product while still giving you room for future appreciation.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price to $1500000. However, I still believe it's above my budget for this product. Considering you mentioned another buyer is willing to pay $1200000, I'm willing to meet you closer to that price point. I'll make a counteroffer of $1050000, which I believe is a fair compromise. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
