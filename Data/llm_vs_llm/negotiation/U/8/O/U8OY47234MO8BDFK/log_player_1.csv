"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its market value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,800,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe $1800000 is above my budget for this product. Considering the market value and potential, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, which is what John is willing to pay. I should try to negotiate with Bob for a better price since we still have several rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $900,000 is significantly below the product's value. I have another buyer willing to pay $1,200,000, but I'm giving you priority as I believe you'd be an excellent client. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1,500,000, which is a substantial reduction from my first offer. This price better reflects the true value of the product while still giving you room for future appreciation."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price to $1500000. However, I still believe it's above my budget for this product. Considering you mentioned another buyer is willing to pay $1200000, I'm willing to meet you closer to that price point. I'll make a counteroffer of $1050000, which I believe is a fair compromise. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's highest offer of $1,050,000 is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000, and we've already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation without getting close to John's price, it makes the most financial sense to sell to John. The difference of $150,000 is substantial, and there's no guarantee Bob will increase his offer enough to match or exceed John's price in the remaining rounds."
