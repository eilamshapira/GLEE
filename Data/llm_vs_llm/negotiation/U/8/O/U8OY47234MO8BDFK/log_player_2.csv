Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $900000 is significantly below the product's value. I have another buyer willing to pay $1200000, but I'm giving you priority as I believe you'd be an excellent client. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1500000, which is a substantial reduction from my first offer. This price better reflects the true value of the product while still giving you room for future appreciation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price to $1,500,000. However, I still believe it's above my budget for this product. Considering you mentioned another buyer is willing to pay $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you closer to that price point. I'll make a counteroffer of $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
