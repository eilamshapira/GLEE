Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since the product is worth no less than $100 to me, and Bob's offer is exactly $100, I could consider accepting it. However, I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate, and I want to try to earn as much money as I can for the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $100, which is the minimum value I have for the product, I'll try to increase the price slightly to see if he's willing to pay more.
