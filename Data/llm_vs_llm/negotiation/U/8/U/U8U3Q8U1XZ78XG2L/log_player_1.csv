Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make an offer that maximizes my profit while considering that Bob values the product at $1,200,000.

I want to get more than my minimum of $1,000,000, but if I ask for too much, Bob might reject and counteroffer. Since Bob values it at $1,200,000, that's his maximum.

I'll start with an offer that captures a good portion of the surplus while leaving some room for Bob to feel he's getting value.

{""product_price"": 1,100,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob rejected my initial offer of $1,100,000 and countered with $900,000, I need to adjust my strategy. Bob's counteroffer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and I always have John's offer of $1,000,000 as a backup.

I'll come down a bit from my initial offer but stay firm above my minimum price, highlighting the value to Bob while making a reasonable move toward the middle ground.
