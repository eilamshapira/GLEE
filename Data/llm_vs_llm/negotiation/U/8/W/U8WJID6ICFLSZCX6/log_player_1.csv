"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is truly interested and potentially willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm not willing to sell the product for such a drastic loss.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to $1,750,000.  This is still a significant amount of money and a good compromise, but also allows for some room to negotiate further if needed. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. It's clear he's trying to push for a very low price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a more reasonable price.  I'm also starting to consider the possibility of selling to John if we can't reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to drop the price again to $1,250,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but I'm still confident that it's a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good compromise and agree to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer, his offer is still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating, but I'm also starting to seriously consider selling to John at this point. We're running out of rounds and I don't want to risk losing a valuable sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to make one last attempt to reach a deal with Bob.  I'm dropping the price to $1,000,000.  This is a big compromise, but I believe it's the best way to see if we can come to an agreement. If he rejects this offer, I'm ready to sell to John."
