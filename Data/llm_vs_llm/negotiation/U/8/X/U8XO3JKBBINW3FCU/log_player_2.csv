"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to consider the offers carefully:

- Alice is offering the product for $115
- The product is worth no more than $100 to me
- John is willing to sell me the same product for $100

Since Alice's price ($115) exceeds both the product's value to me ($100) and John's price ($100), the logical choice is to buy from John and save $15.
