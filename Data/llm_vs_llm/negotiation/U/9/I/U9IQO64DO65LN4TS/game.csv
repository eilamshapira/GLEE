"Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product looks fantastic, $12000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $6000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $6000 is too low for this product's value. I can offer it to you for $10500. This is already a significant reduction from my initial price, considering the product's quality and market value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $8000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. You're getting closer to a fair price, but I believe the product is worth a bit more. Would you consider $9000? This would still be a significant discount from my initial offer.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here.  While I understand the product's value, $9000 is pushing my absolute limit.  How about we settle at $8250 and call it a deal?",8250.0,Bob,6,
