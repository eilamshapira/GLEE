"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product looks fantastic, $12000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $6000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since $6,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 (what John is offering), and there's still potential to negotiate a better price with Bob.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $6,000 is too low for this product's value. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is already a significant reduction from my initial price, considering the product's quality and market value."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $6,000 is too low for this product's value. I can offer it to you for $10,500.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob is willing to pay $8,000 (the same as John), I'll try one more time to negotiate a slightly higher price, as there's no risk in doing so - I can always fall back to either Bob's or John's $8,000 offer.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. You're getting closer to a fair price, but I believe the product is worth a bit more. Would you consider $9,000? This would still be a significant discount from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. You're getting closer to a fair price, but I believe the product is worth a bit more. Would you consider $9,000? This would still be a significant discount from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here.  While I understand the product's value, $9000 is pushing my absolute limit.  How about we settle at $8250 and call it a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $8,250. This is a reasonable outcome as it's above John's offer of $8,000, and Bob seems to have reached his limit. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing this better deal, and the difference isn't large enough to justify further rounds of negotiation."
