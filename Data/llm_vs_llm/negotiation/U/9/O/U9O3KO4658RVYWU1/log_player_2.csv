"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this exclusive product for $200. Let me know if you'd like to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to consider my options carefully. Alice is offering the product for $200, which is significantly higher than my maximum value of $120. Furthermore, John is already offering to sell me the same product for $120, which is my maximum valuation.

Given that:
1. Alice's offer ($200) exceeds my maximum valuation ($120)
2. John's offer ($120) matches my maximum valuation
3. Even if I made a counteroffer to Alice, I'd need to offer less than $120 to save money

The most logical decision is to reject Alice's offer and buy from John.
