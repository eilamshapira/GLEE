Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to spend less, but I need to be transparent that $900,000 is below my minimum threshold for this product. The product's intrinsic value to me is $1,000,000, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can reduce my asking price to $1,200,000, which still provides you with $300,000 in value based on what this product is worth to your business. This is a significant discount from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
