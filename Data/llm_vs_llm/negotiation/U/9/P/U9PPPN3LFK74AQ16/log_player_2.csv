Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to spend less, but I need to be transparent that $900000 is below my minimum threshold for this product. The product's intrinsic value to me is $1000000, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can reduce my asking price to $1200000, which still provides you with $300000 in value based on what this product is worth to your business. This is a significant discount from my initial offer.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
