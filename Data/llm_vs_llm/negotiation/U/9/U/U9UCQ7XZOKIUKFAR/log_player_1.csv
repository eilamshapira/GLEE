Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Okay, this is not ideal. I need to make a decision. Selling to John for $8,000 is a guaranteed profit, but I might be able to get more from Bob. However, Bob's initial counteroffer is *very* low.

Given the situation, I will:

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","This is a critical point. Bob is now offering $8,000. That's the same price John is offering. I need to make a decision.

I can:

*   Accept Bob's offer: This secures the sale, but I don't know if Bob might be willing to pay more.
*   Reject and Counteroffer: This could potentially lead to a higher price, but also risks Bob walking away.
*   Sell to John: This guarantees a sale at $8,000, and removes the uncertainty.

Since I don't know Bob's true valuation, I'm going to take the guaranteed $8,000.
