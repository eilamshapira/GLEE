(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $2,000,000, this exceeds my maximum value for the product ($1,200,000). Since I can buy the same product from John for exactly $1,200,000, Alice's current offer is not competitive at all.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I need to make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice. Since I know I can get the product from John for $1,200,000, I'll make an offer that's below that to leave room for negotiation.

However, this is still significantly higher than John's fixed price of $1,200,000. Since Alice's current offer still exceeds my maximum value and John's price, I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $2,000,000 to $1,800,000, I can see she's willing to negotiate but still far from John's price. I'll increase my previous offer somewhat but still keep it well below John's price to maintain room for negotiation.
