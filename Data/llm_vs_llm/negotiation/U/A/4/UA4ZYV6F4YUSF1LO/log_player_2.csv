"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer ($150) is higher than both my maximum valuation ($100) and John's price ($100), it would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. Given that John is offering the product at $100, which equals my maximum valuation, the best decision would be to buy from John.
