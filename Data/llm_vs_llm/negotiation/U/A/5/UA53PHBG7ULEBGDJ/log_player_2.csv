"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given the information provided, Alice is offering to sell the product for $12,000, which is $4,000 more than what it's worth to you ($8,000). Meanwhile, John is offering the same product for $8,000, which matches your maximum value for the product.

While you could reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price through a counteroffer, there's no guarantee that Alice will accept a price below $8,000 (which is what the product is worth to her). Since you already have an option to purchase the product at exactly your maximum value ($8,000) from John, that seems like the most prudent choice.
