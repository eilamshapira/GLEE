"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. If Bob rejects, we'll see what kind of counteroffer he makes and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price, and I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm reducing my price slightly but still aiming for a substantial profit. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is a bit higher than before, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'll try one more counteroffer, hoping to push him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm now willing to accept the minimum I'm willing to sell for, which is the price John is offering.  This should make the deal more attractive for Bob, as he's not losing out by accepting my offer."
