"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're interested in acquiring this product. Given its unique value, I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects its significance. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Considering the options:

*   **Accept Alice's offer:** This would cost $1,150,000.
*   **Buy from John:** This would cost $1,200,000.

Since $1,150,000 is less than $1,200,000, and also less than my maximum willingness to pay of $1,200,000, I should accept Alice's offer.
