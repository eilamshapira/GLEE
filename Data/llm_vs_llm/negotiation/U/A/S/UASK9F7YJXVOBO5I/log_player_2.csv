"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that might be of interest to you. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to make a deal. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Alice's offer of $100 is less than your $120 maximum and cheaper than buying from John.  You save $20!"
