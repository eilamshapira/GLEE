"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $30000 is out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12000 won’t do. I’m prepared to negotiate further if you’re willing to come closer to the product’s value.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your interest. I understand your budget concerns, but I can’t go below $17000. This reflects the product's quality and value, and frankly, I have another buyer ready at $15000. Let me know if you can meet this price, and we can proceed.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to consider my previous offer. However, $17000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $14500. If you're willing to accept this offer, I'm ready to make the purchase.",14500.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, given the product's value, I'm going to proceed with selling to John for $15000.",,Alice,4,SellToJhon
