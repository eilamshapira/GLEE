"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you my exclusive product for $30000. Please let me know if you'd like to proceed at that price or if you’d prefer to discuss a counteroffer. (Just so you know, I have another buyer ready to purchase at $15000.) 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $30,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $30,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer of $30,000 is twice my maximum budget of $15,000, and I know that I can buy the product from John for $15,000, it doesn't make sense to accept Alice's offer. Additionally, Alice mentioned that she has another buyer ready to purchase at $15,000, which suggests that she may be willing to sell at a lower price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I know that Alice has another buyer ready to purchase at $15,000, I'll start by making a counteroffer that's lower than that price to see how she responds. I'll offer $12,000, which is still a reasonable price and leaves some room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $30,000 is out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your interest. I understand your budget concerns, but I can’t go below $17000. This reflects the product's quality and value, and frankly, I have another buyer ready at $15000. Let me know if you can meet this price, and we can proceed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $17,000 is still above my maximum budget of $15,000. While she mentioned that she has another buyer ready at $15,000, her current offer is $2,000 higher than that. I'm not willing to pay more than $15,000 for the product, and since I have the option to buy it from John at that price, I don't see a reason to accept Alice's offer.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and consider my next move. Since I know that Alice is willing to sell to another buyer at $15,000, I could try to make another counteroffer or simply buy from John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice mentioned that she has another buyer ready to purchase at $15,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to that price. I'll offer $14,500, which is still slightly lower than the other buyer's offer, but shows that I'm willing to negotiate and serious about buying the product.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to consider my previous offer. However, $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $14,500. If you're willing to accept this offer, I'm ready to make the purchase."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
