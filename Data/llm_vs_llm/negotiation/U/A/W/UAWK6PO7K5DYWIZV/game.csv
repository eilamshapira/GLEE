"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $60 for the product. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is too low for this product's value. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I know the product is worth more. I can offer it to you for $130, which is already a reduction from my initial price.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but $130 is still above what I can afford. How about we settle at $70? This is a fair price considering my budget constraints.",70.0,Bob,4,
