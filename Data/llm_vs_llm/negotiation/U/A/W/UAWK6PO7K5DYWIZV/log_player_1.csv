"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $150. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $60 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and even below his own valuation of $80. There's room for negotiation to reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is too low for this product's value. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I know the product is worth more. I can offer it to you for $130, which is already a reduction from my initial price."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but $130 is still above what I can afford. How about we settle at $70? This is a fair price considering my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I choose to sell to John because:
1. Bob's offers ($60, $70) are well below my minimum acceptable price of $120
2. Bob seems unwilling to offer close to even his own valuation of $80
3. John's guaranteed offer of $120 matches my minimum acceptable price
4. After multiple rounds, the negotiation with Bob isn't moving toward a mutually acceptable price
5. There's no point continuing negotiations when I have a guaranteed buyer at my minimum acceptable price"
