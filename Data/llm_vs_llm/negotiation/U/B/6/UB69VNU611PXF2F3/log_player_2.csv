"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $140. This is a fair price considering the product's worth, and I believe it would be a beneficial deal for both of us. Would you like to proceed with the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $140 is lower than your maximum budget, there's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price further.  You're willing to risk buying from John at $150, so it makes sense to see if you can get a better deal from Alice."
