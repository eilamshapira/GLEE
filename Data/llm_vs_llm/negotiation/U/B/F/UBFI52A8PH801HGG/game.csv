"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $25000. What do you say?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $25000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $15000 to me, and I actually have another seller named John who's willing to sell me the same product for $15000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. I'd be willing to offer $10000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to the other seller.",10000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your position, I believe the product's value exceeds $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $17500. This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer while still recognizing the product's worth. Let me know what you think.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, considering your budget constraints and my need to maintain the product's value, I'm proposing a new offer of $16000. This price is a further reduction from my last offer and shows my willingness to work with you. What are your thoughts?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $16000 is getting closer, but I still have John's offer of $15000, and I can't justify paying more than that since the product is worth at most $15000 to me. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead of John, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $12500. This is a fair middle ground between my previous offer and your latest one, and it would save me the hassle of dealing with another seller.",12500.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I understand your position and the offer from John. However, I believe the product holds more value than $12500. I'm willing to lower my price further to $15000. This offer is a significant concession from my side and is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I've considered your situation and the competitive offer you have. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to further reduce the price to $14000. This is a substantial discount and reflects my desire to close the deal with you. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",14000.0,Alice,5,
