"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $25,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $25000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $15000 to me, and I actually have another seller named John who's willing to sell me the same product for $15000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. I'd be willing to offer $10000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to the other seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I appreciate your position, I believe the product's value exceeds $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $17,500. This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer while still recognizing the product's worth. Let me know what you think.""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, considering your budget constraints and my need to maintain the product's value, I'm proposing a new offer of $16,000. This price is a further reduction from my last offer and shows my willingness to work with you. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $16000 is getting closer, but I still have John's offer of $15000, and I can't justify paying more than that since the product is worth at most $15000 to me. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead of John, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $12500. This is a fair middle ground between my previous offer and your latest one, and it would save me the hassle of dealing with another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position and the offer from John. However, I believe the product holds more value than $12,500. I'm willing to lower my price further to $15,000. This offer is a significant concession from my side and is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you.""}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I've considered your situation and the competitive offer you have. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to further reduce the price to $14,000. This is a substantial discount and reflects my desire to close the deal with you. Please let me know if this is acceptable."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
