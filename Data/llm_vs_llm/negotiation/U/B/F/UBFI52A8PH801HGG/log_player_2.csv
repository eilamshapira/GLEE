"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $25000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","The offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than what the product is worth to me (no more than $15,000) and is also higher than John's price of $15,000. It makes no sense for me to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $25,000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, and I actually have another seller named John who's willing to sell me the same product for $15,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. I'd be willing to offer $10,000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to the other seller."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, considering your budget constraints and my need to maintain the product's value, I'm proposing a new offer of $16000. This price is a further reduction from my last offer and shows my willingness to work with you. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer of $25,000 to $16,000, which is much more reasonable. However, this is still $1,000 more than John's price of $15,000, and since the product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, it doesn't make sense to pay more than that.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $16,000 is getting closer, but I still have John's offer of $15,000, and I can't justify paying more than that since the product is worth at most $15,000 to me. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead of John, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $12,500. This is a fair middle ground between my previous offer and your latest one, and it would save me the hassle of dealing with another seller."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I've considered your situation and the competitive offer you have. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to further reduce the price to $14000. This is a substantial discount and reflects my desire to close the deal with you. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has now offered $14,000, which is $1,000 less than John's price of $15,000. Since the product is worth up to $15,000 to me, and Alice's offer is below that threshold, this is a good deal that saves me money compared to buying from John.
