While Alice's offer matches your maximum price, there's no harm in trying to negotiate a lower price.  I'll try to counteroffer with a lower amount to see if we can get a better deal."

Let's start by offering significantly less than our maximum. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a good discount."

This counteroffer splits the difference between our last offer and her current one. It shows we're willing to negotiate but still aiming for a significant discount."
