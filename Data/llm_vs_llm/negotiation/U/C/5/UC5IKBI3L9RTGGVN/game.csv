"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $11500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very beneficial.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While your product does interest me, $11500 is a bit steep for my budget. I know this product is available elsewhere for similar prices. I'm prepared to offer you $10500 for it, which I believe is fair and still gives you a good profit margin. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $11000? It's still a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still finding $11000 a bit high for my budget. I could go up to $10800 which would be a fair compromise between our positions. This gives you a good profit while helping me stay within my budget constraints. Does that work for you?",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10800 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference - $10900. I'm sure we can agree on this fair price, which still allows me to make a decent profit.",10900.0,Alice,5,
