Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While your product does interest me, $11500 is a bit steep for my budget. I know this product is available elsewhere for similar prices. I'm prepared to offer you $10500 for it, which I believe is fair and still gives you a good profit margin. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $11,000? It's still a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still finding $11000 a bit high for my budget. I could go up to $10800 which would be a fair compromise between our positions. This gives you a good profit while helping me stay within my budget constraints. Does that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800.
