"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $11500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very beneficial. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $11,500, I need to consider my options carefully. The product is worth up to $12,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for $12,000 as my backup option.

Alice's initial offer of $11,500 is already $500 less than John's price, which is good. However, since the product is only worth $10,000 to Alice, there's potentially room to negotiate an even better price.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. We have 10 rounds total, so there's still plenty of time to negotiate a better deal.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While your product does interest me, $11,500 is a bit steep for my budget. I know this product is available elsewhere for similar prices. I'm prepared to offer you $10,500 for it, which I believe is fair and still gives you a good profit margin. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $11000? It's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her price from $11,500 to $11,000, which is a good move in our negotiation. This price is now $1,000 less than John's offer of $12,000.

Since I know the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, there's still room for her to go lower while making a profit. However, her current offer of $11,000 is already getting more attractive.

I'll try one more round of negotiation to see if we can meet closer to the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still finding $11,000 a bit high for my budget. I could go up to $10,800 which would be a fair compromise between our positions. This gives you a good profit while helping me stay within my budget constraints. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 10800}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10800 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference - $10900. I'm sure we can agree on this fair price, which still allows me to make a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has now offered $10,900, which is a very good price - it's $1,100 less than John's alternative offer of $12,000. 

Alice has moved from $11,500 → $11,000 → $10,900, and we've moved from $10,500 → $10,800. We're only $100 apart now. Alice is offering a fair price that's close to what I've been aiming for, and it's clear she's willing to negotiate reasonably.

Since we're just $100 apart and the current offer is already significantly better than the alternative with John, I'll accept this offer.
