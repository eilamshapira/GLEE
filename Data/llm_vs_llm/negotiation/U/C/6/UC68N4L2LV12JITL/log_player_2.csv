"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Here's my reasoning:

*   **I value the product at a maximum of $15,000.**
*   **Alice's offer is $12,000.** This is significantly below my maximum valuation.

Therefore, I should accept Alice's offer.
