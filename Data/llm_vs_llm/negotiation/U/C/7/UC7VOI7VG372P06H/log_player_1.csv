Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider the situation carefully. I need to sell this product for at least $15,000 since that's its minimum value to me. Bob values it at only $12,000, which means any price I offer above $12,000 will be rejected by Bob.

If Bob rejects my offer, I can sell to John for $15,000. Since Bob won't pay more than $12,000 and I won't accept less than $15,000, it makes most sense to offer a price that ensures I get my minimum value.
