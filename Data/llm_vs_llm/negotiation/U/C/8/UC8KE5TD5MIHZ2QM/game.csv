"Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product.  Given its immense value, I'm proposing a starting price of $950000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $950000 is quite steep for this product. Given market conditions and comparable products, I believe a more reasonable price would be $850000. This still provides you with a healthy profit margin while being more aligned with market value.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $850000 is certainly attractive, this product offers significant long-term value that justifies a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925000. This represents a fair compromise and still reflects the exceptional quality of this product.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $925000 is still considerably higher than what I'm prepared to pay. I understand the product's value, but I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. I can raise my offer to $875000, which represents a significant premium over market value and ensures a profitable transaction for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $900000. This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your movement on the price and understand your position about this being your final offer. However, I've done extensive market research and have other options available. I'm prepared to meet you very close to the middle at $885000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and represents a very fair price for both parties. I'm ready to close this deal immediately at this price.",885000.0,Bob,6,
