Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $950000 is quite steep for this product. Given market conditions and comparable products, I believe a more reasonable price would be $850000. This still provides you with a healthy profit margin while being more aligned with market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $850,000 is certainly attractive, this product offers significant long-term value that justifies a higher price point.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $925000 is still considerably higher than what I'm prepared to pay. I understand the product's value, but I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. I can raise my offer to $875000, which represents a significant premium over market value and ensures a profitable transaction for both of us.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your movement on the price and understand your position about this being your final offer. However, I've done extensive market research and have other options available. I'm prepared to meet you very close to the middle at $885000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and represents a very fair price for both parties. I'm ready to close this deal immediately at this price.
