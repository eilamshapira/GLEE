You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","This offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and even below what John is willing to pay. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-offer, lowering my initial price but still maintaining room for negotiation.

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer of $7,000 is still well below John's guaranteed offer of $12,000, which is also my minimum acceptable price. While Bob has increased his offer, the gap is still too large, and we're already in round 4. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, and Bob's offers are still far below this, I'll choose to sell to John.
