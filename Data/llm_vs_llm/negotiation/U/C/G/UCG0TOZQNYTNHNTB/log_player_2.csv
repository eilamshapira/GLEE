"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since John is offering the product for $800,000, which is not only within my budget but also significantly cheaper than Alice's offer of $2,000,000, the logical choice is to buy from John. This will save me $1,200,000 compared to Alice's offer."
