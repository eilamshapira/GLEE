"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a incredible offer for you. I'm willing to sell my premium product to you for a great price of $900000. This product is in high demand, and I have another buyer willing to pay top dollar for it. Don't miss out on this opportunity! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to consider my options here. 

The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me.
Alice is offering to sell it for $900,000.
John is willing to sell the same product to me for $800,000.

If I accept Alice's offer, I'd be paying $100,000 more than the product is worth to me.
If I buy from John, I'd pay exactly what the product is worth to me.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, the clear choice is to buy from John.
