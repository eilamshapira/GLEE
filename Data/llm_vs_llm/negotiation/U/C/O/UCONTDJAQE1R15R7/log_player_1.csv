"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit.

{""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer ($70) is below my minimum acceptable price ($80) and even below John's guaranteed offer ($80), I will reject this offer. Moreover, since I still have 8 rounds left for negotiation, I'll try to negotiate further with Bob rather than immediately selling to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still keep it well above my minimum threshold.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer ($75) is still below my minimum acceptable price ($80) and below John's guaranteed offer ($80). While Bob is increasing his offers, they're still not reaching my minimum threshold. Since John's offer is better than Bob's current offer, and Bob's increases are quite small, I'll choose to sell to John.
