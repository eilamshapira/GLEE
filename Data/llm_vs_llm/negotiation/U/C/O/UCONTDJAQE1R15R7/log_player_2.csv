Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice. $95 is a bit too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
``` 

Let's start with a significantly lower offer to see how much room for negotiation we have."

We're making progress!  Alice came down $5. Let's keep negotiating."

Meeting Alice halfway between her last offer ($90) and our previous offer ($70) seems like a reasonable next step."
