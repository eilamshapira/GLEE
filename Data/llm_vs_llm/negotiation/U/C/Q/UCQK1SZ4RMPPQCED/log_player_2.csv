"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($15,000) and John's alternative offer ($15,000). It would be irrational to accept this offer when I have a better alternative. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 12000}

Rationale: Since Alice values the product at $15,000 and I know there's a backup option to buy from John at $15,000, I'll start with a lower offer of $12,000. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially allowing Alice to make a profit. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground that's below $15,000, which would benefit both of us compared to my alternative option with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: Alice has reduced her price from $20,000 to $18,000, showing some willingness to negotiate, but it's still above both my maximum valuation and John's offer of $15,000. There's no reason to accept this offer when I have a guaranteed better option with John. I'll continue negotiating with another counteroffer to try to get a price below $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 13500}

Rationale: I'm raising my offer from $12,000 to $13,500, which shows I'm willing to negotiate upward. This price point is strategically chosen because:
1. It's still below John's price of $15,000
2. It could be profitable for Alice (since her cost is $15,000, she might prefer taking a small loss rather than no sale)
3. It shows significant movement from my previous offer, demonstrating good faith in negotiations
4. If Alice rejects this, I still have several rounds left and can either increase my offer slightly or switch to John's option"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Rationale: At this point, it's clear that Alice is still trying to sell above $15,000, which is both my maximum valuation and John's offering price. While Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, her current price of $16,500 is still $1,500 more than what I can get from John. Since there's no indication that Alice will go below $15,000 (especially since that's her own cost), it makes the most economic sense to take John's offer of $15,000 rather than continue negotiations or accept a higher price."
