"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $140 is a bit high for me. Given the market value of this product, I think $115 would be a fair price. This would still give you a good profit margin. What do you think?",115.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your perspective, $115 is lower than what I'm looking to get for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about we settle at $130? This should still be a great deal for you while allowing me to maintain a reasonable profit margin. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price. Let's meet in the middle. How about $125? This price reflects a good value for you and a fair return for me. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,
