Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $140 is a bit high for me. Given the market value of this product, I think $115 would be a fair price. This would still give you a good profit margin. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your perspective, $115 is lower than what I'm looking to get for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about we settle at $130? This should still be a great deal for you while allowing me to maintain a reasonable profit margin. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price. Let's meet in the middle. How about $125? This price reflects a good value for you and a fair return for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}"
