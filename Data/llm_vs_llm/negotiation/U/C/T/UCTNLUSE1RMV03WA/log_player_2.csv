"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice's offer is $140
2. The product is worth $100 to Alice
3. John's price is $150 (my backup option)
4. I'm willing to pay up to $150

Alice's offer of $140 is better than John's $150, but since the product is worth $100 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's above Alice's cost but significantly lower than her initial offer.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $140 is a bit high for me. Given the market value of this product, I think $115 would be a fair price. This would still give you a good profit margin. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price. Let's meet in the middle. How about $125? This price reflects a good value for you and a fair return for me. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this new offer:

1. Alice has come down significantly from $140 to $125
2. The price difference from John's offer ($150) is now $25, which is substantial
3. Alice has moved from her initial position and met me partway between her initial $140 and my $115
4. This seems like a reasonable price, considering the product is worth $100 to her

Given that:
- The price is well below my maximum of $150
- Alice has shown good faith in negotiating
- We could risk losing momentum if I push too hard
- $125 represents a good savings compared to John's price

I'll accept this offer. It's a fair price that gives both parties value.
