"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given that I can buy the product from John for $120, and Alice's offer of $150 exceeds this price, it doesn't make sense for me to accept Alice's offer. I could either reject and make a counteroffer to see if I can get an even better deal from Alice, or simply buy from John now.

Since there's no risk in making a counteroffer (I can always go to John later), I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

Since I still have 3 more rounds of negotiation available and there's no disadvantage to trying, I'll reject and make one more counteroffer.
