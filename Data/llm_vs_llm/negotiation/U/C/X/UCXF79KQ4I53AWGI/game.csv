"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe it has value, but $2500000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $1000000 is below what I'm looking for given the product's value. I understand my initial ask was high, so I'm willing to come down significantly to $1800000. This price better reflects the product's true market value and potential return on investment. Would you consider this revised offer?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for revising your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1800000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1400000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value and market conditions.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
