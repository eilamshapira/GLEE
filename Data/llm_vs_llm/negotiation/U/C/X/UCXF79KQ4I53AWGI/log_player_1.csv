"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it at $2,500,000. This is a premium product with significant value potential. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe it has value, but $2500000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob immediately matched John's price of $1,000,000, this suggests he might be willing to pay more. I can still sell to John later if negotiations don't go well, so it's worth making a counteroffer to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $1,000,000 is below what I'm looking for given the product's value. I understand my initial ask was high, so I'm willing to come down significantly to $1,800,000. This price better reflects the product's true market value and potential return on investment. Would you consider this revised offer?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for revising your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1800000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1400000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value and market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob has offered $1,400,000, which is significantly better than John's fixed price of $1,000,000. Since Bob has moved up considerably from his initial offer, and there's always a risk he might reduce his offer if negotiations continue too long, it's wise to accept this offer now. The $400,000 premium over John's price makes this a good deal."
