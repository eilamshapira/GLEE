"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it at $2500000. This is a premium product with significant value potential. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since the offer of $2,500,000 is above my budget of $1,500,000, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still shows that I'm interested in the product. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a relatively low offer.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe it has value, but $2,500,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $1000000 is below what I'm looking for given the product's value. I understand my initial ask was high, so I'm willing to come down significantly to $1800000. This price better reflects the product's true market value and potential return on investment. Would you consider this revised offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's revised offer of $1,800,000 is still above my target budget of $1,500,000. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,500,000, I don't see a need to accept Alice's offer at this point.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has already come down from $2,500,000 to $1,800,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between her current offer and my previous offer. I'll increase my offer from $1,000,000 to $1,400,000, which is still below my maximum budget of $1,500,000.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for revising your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value and market conditions."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
