"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional qualities and potential benefits, I'm initially offering it to you for $25000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's initial offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than the maximum of $12,000 that the product is worth to you. It's also more than double the price that John is offering ($12,000). 

Since you can buy the product from John for exactly the maximum value it has to you, there's no reason to pay Alice's much higher price. While you could try to negotiate with Alice, you already have a guaranteed option at your maximum value point.
