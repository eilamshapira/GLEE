"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. Considering the current market conditions and my budget, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, but I need to point out that this product offers exceptional value and capabilities that justify a higher price point. While I can't accept $900000, I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial offer. I can offer the product for $1050000, which I believe strikes a fair balance between your budget constraints and the true value of what you're getting. This represents a substantial discount from my initial price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the discount you're willing to provide. However, I still feel that $1050000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current one. I'm willing to increase my offer to $975000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this.",975000.0,Bob,4,
