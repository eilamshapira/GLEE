Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. Considering the current market conditions and my budget, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, but I need to point out that this product offers exceptional value and capabilities that justify a higher price point. While I can't accept $900,000, I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial offer. I can offer the product for $1,050,000, which I believe strikes a fair balance between your budget constraints and the true value of what you're getting. This represents a substantial discount from my initial price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"

I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current one. I'm willing to increase my offer to $975000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this.
