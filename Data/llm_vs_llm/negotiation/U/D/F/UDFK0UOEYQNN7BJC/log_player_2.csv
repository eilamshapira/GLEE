Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, but I need to point out that this product offers exceptional value and capabilities that justify a higher price point. While I can't accept $900000, I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial offer. I can offer the product for $1050000, which I believe strikes a fair balance between your budget constraints and the true value of what you're getting. This represents a substantial discount from my initial price.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the discount you're willing to provide. However, I still feel that $1,050,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current one. I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this."", ""product_price"": 975000}"
