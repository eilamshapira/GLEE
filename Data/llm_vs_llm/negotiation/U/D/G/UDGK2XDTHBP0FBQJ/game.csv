"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the quality you describe, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counter offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I can't go as low as $80 as the product is worth no less than $100 to me. However, I'm willing to come down from my initial price. I can offer it to you for $150. This represents a significant discount from my original price while still reflecting the product's true value.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $150 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $100 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and your willingness to negotiate.",100.0,Bob,4,
