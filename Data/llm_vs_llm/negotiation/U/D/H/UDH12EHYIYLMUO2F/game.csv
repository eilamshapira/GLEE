"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is too high for me. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $150. I'd like to offer you $120 for the product, which would still give you a good deal while providing me with some savings compared to other options.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $120 is too low for me. I'm willing to lower my price to $160. This is a fair deal considering the product's quality and market value.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, I still can't accept $160 as I can purchase this product from another seller for $150. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer you $135, which would save me some money compared to my other option while still giving you a reasonable price.",135.0,Bob,4,
