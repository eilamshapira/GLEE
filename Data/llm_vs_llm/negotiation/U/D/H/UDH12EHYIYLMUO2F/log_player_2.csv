"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $150 to me
2. John is offering the same product for $150
3. Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer because $180 is above both my maximum valuation ($150) and John's alternative price ($150). There's no reason to accept a price higher than what I can get elsewhere or what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is too high for me. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $150. I'd like to offer you $120 for the product, which would still give you a good deal while providing me with some savings compared to other options."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $120 is too low for me. I'm willing to lower my price to $160. This is a fair deal considering the product's quality and market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $150 to me
2. John is offering the same product for $150
3. Alice's new offer of $160 is still higher than both my maximum value and John's price

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer because even though she lowered the price, $160 is still above both my maximum valuation ($150) and John's alternative price ($150). There's no reason to pay more than what I can get elsewhere."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, I still can't accept $160 as I can purchase this product from another seller for $150. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer you $135, which would save me some money compared to my other option while still giving you a reasonable price."", ""product_price"": 135}"
