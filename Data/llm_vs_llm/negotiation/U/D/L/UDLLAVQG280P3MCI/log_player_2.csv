"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this premium product for $1200000. Please let me know if you'd like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's initial offer is at the maximum value I'm willing to pay ($1,200,000), and I have the option to buy the same product from John for the same price, I see no benefit in accepting Alice's offer immediately without trying to negotiate a better price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in hopes of getting a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make an initial counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still reasonable, considering the product's value to me. Let's start with a counteroffer of $600,000, which is half of the maximum I'm willing to pay. This gives room for negotiation and allows us to find a mutually agreeable price.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
