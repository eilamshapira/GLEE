"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 
I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, aiming to see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to counteroffer to get a price closer to what I want."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $85,  a price that's still higher than Bob's offer but closer to my desired price. This might be enough to get Bob to accept, but if not, I can always counteroffer again."
