"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I find the price a bit high. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. Would you consider this offer? I look forward to your response.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest and counteroffer. I appreciate your proposal, but I cannot accept $8000 as it's below the minimum value of the product to me. I should mention that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $10000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can reduce my initial price to $12500. This represents a significant discount from my original offer while still reflecting the product's true value. Would this work for you?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I still find the price a bit high. I'm willing to raise my offer to $9000. Please consider this, and let's see if we can find some middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $9000, which shows your genuine interest in the product. However, as I mentioned, I have John ready to pay $10000, which is the minimum value of the product to me. Since I'd prefer to work with you, I'm willing to match John's price and offer you the product for $10000. This is my final price, as anything lower would mean I'd be better off selling to John. I hope we can conclude this deal at this fair price point.",10000.0,Alice,5,
