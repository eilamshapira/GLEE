"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a product that I believe could be of great value to you. Given its quality and the benefits it provides, I'm pricing it at $14000. This represents excellent value considering what this product can do for you.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $14000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your offer. However, $10500 is too close to my absolute minimum threshold. The product has significant value, and while I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go that low. I can come down to $13000, which is still a great value considering what this product is worth.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but I need to stick to my budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11750?",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand budget constraints, and I appreciate your continued interest. While $11750 is moving in the right direction, I'm still not able to go that low given the product's value. I'm willing to come down to $12500, which I believe represents a fair compromise between us. This is significantly below my initial offer and represents excellent value for what you're getting.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference again and settle at $12125?",12125.0,Bob,6,
