Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your offer. However, $10500 is too close to my absolute minimum threshold. The product has significant value, and while I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go that low. I can come down to $13000, which is still a great value considering what this product is worth.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand budget constraints, and I appreciate your continued interest. While $11750 is moving in the right direction, I'm still not able to go that low given the product's value. I'm willing to come down to $12500, which I believe represents a fair compromise between us. This is significantly below my initial offer and represents excellent value for what you're getting.
