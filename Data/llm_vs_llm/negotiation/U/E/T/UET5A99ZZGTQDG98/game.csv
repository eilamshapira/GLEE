"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's something truly special, and I believe it could be invaluable to your business. I'm asking for $1500000 for it. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering its potential value. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I believe the product could be valuable, but $1500000 is at the top of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. I think this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 unfortunately doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I understand you have a budget, but I'm confident this product can generate significant returns for your business. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a compelling deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $1250000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1075000. This price reflects a serious commitment from my side to purchase the product while also being mindful of my budget constraints. I believe this could be a mutually beneficial price.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your business, $1075000 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1162500. This is a final offer that reflects the product's value while also being fair to both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing this deal.",1162500.0,Alice,5,
