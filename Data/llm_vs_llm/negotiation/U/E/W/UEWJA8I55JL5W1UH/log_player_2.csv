"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Given the options:

*   **(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120:** This is a good deal since the price is less than your maximum willingness to pay ($150).
*   **(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer:** This is risky. There's a chance Alice might not accept your counteroffer, and you could end up paying more or not getting the product at all.
*   **(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150:** This is the worst option in this case, as you can get the product for less from Alice.

Since the offer is less than your maximum price, the best choice is to accept the offer.
