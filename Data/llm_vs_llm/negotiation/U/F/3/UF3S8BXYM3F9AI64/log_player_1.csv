"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my initial offer and also lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($150), and considering I have the option to sell it to John for $150, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I am willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. Thus, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

My counteroffer would be to meet in the middle between my initial offer and Bob's offer, but since his offer is very low, I'll aim higher. Let's say my counteroffer is $180.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my new offer to Bob is $180."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's new offer of $90 is still significantly lower than my last counteroffer of $180 and also lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($150). Given that I have the option to sell the product to John for $150, which is higher than Bob's offer, I am inclined to reject Bob's offer again.

However, I am willing to continue negotiating to see if Bob is willing to increase his offer to a more reasonable price. Since Bob's offers have been increasing ($80 to $90), it indicates he is interested in the product and might be willing to pay more.

My next counteroffer will be lower than $180 but still higher than $150, aiming to encourage Bob to meet me at a price that is at least my minimum acceptable value.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my new offer to Bob is $160. 

{""product_price"": 160}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's offer of $95 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Although he has been incrementally increasing his offer, it's clear that we are still quite far apart in terms of price.

Given that I have the option to sell the product to John for $150, which is significantly higher than Bob's current offer, I am inclined to reject Bob's offer once again. Continuing to negotiate with Bob at this point may not yield a price that meets my minimum requirement, and I risk spending more time without reaching a satisfactory agreement.

Therefore, my decision is to reject Bob's offer and consider selling to John, as his offer of $150 is the best option on the table at this moment.
