Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my offer to Bob. I know my product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I have John as a guaranteed backup buyer at that price.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I need to balance setting a higher price (to maximize my profit) against the risk of Bob rejecting my offer. If Bob rejects, I still get $1,200,000 from John, so there's no downside to making a somewhat aggressive offer to Bob.

I'll offer the product at a premium above my minimum acceptable price:

{""product_price"": 1,500,000}"
