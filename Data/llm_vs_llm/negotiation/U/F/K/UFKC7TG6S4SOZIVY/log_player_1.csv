Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","This is a tough one! Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum value.

I'll **RejectOffer** and make a counteroffer. I believe the product is worth more than $50 to him, so I'll try to get a better price.

I'm going to **RejectOffer** again. I'll try to get Bob to go higher.
