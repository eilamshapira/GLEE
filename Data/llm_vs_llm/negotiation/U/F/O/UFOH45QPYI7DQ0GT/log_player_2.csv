"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you this exclusive product for $150. Let me know if you’d like to take it off my hands! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to evaluate Alice's offer compared to my alternatives.

Alice is offering the product for $150, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay (since the product is worth no more than $150 to me).

John is also offering the product for exactly $150.

In this situation, both offers cost the same amount, but if I reject Alice's offer, I'll end up buying from John for the same price. There's no financial advantage to rejecting Alice's offer.
