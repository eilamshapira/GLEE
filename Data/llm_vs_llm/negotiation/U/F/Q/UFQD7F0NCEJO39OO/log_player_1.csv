Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($1,200,000) and also lower than what the product is worth to him ($800,000), I will reject his offer and proceed to make a counteroffer that is closer to my target price but still leaves room for negotiation.

My counteroffer will be $1,000,000.
