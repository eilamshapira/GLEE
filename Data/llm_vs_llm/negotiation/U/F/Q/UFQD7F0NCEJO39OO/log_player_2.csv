"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $1,200,000 is way too high, considering:
1. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed alternative from John at $800,000
3. Alice's asking price ($1,200,000) is exactly what the product is worth to her, meaning she's not offering any room for mutual benefit

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer that's more reasonable. If we can't reach an agreement better than $800,000, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 600000}

I'm offering $600,000 because:
1. It gives Alice some room to negotiate up while still keeping the price below my maximum acceptable price of $800,000
2. It's significantly below John's price of $800,000, giving me potential savings
3. While it's well below Alice's asking price, it still provides her with an opportunity to make a profit since it's reasonable to assume her cost is lower than her selling price
4. If Alice rejects this, we can negotiate towards a middle ground, while I still have John's offer as a backup"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll buy from John because:
1. Alice's new offer of $1,000,000 is still significantly above my maximum value of $800,000
2. John's guaranteed price of $800,000 is better than Alice's current offer
3. Even though Alice has moved down from her initial price, she's still far from a price that would be beneficial to me
4. There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will result in a price below $800,000
5. It's better to take John's certain offer of $800,000 rather than risk more time negotiating when Alice seems unlikely to match or beat this price"
