"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $8000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $15000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for your new proposal. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $15000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new proposal. I'm willing to offer $10000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the compromise we're both making.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, we're still quite far apart on price.  To be honest, $12000 is the absolute lowest I can go. I have another interested buyer at that price, but I'm offering you the chance first because you initiated contact.  Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,5,
