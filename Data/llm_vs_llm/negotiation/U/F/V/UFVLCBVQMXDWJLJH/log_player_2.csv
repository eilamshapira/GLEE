"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. I'm offering it to you for $2500000. This product has exceptional value that justifies this price point, and I'm providing you the first opportunity to acquire it. If you're interested, I can provide more details about what makes this product so valuable. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $2,500,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum valuation of $1,200,000. Even if the product is exceptional, it wouldn't be worth more than $1,200,000 to me.

John is offering the exact same product for $1,200,000, which matches my maximum valuation. While this is the maximum I'd be willing to pay, it's still a better deal than Alice's offer.
