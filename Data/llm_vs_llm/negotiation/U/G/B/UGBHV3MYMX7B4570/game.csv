"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'm looking for $1400000, which I think is a fair value considering its worth to you.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your product, I believe $1400000 is a bit high. Given market conditions, I'd like to propose $1300000, which would still provide you with a good profit margin while being more aligned with my budget. This offer represents a fair middle ground for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my initial offer. I can offer you the product for $1375000, which is a compromise between my initial price and your counteroffer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you while taking into account your budget constraints.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving down from your initial offer. However, I still feel we can find a price point that works better for both of us. I can increase my previous offer to $1335000, which represents a significant movement from my last offer and provides you with a healthy profit margin. This price would allow us to close the deal quickly and would be mutually beneficial.",1335000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the increase from your previous proposal, and I'm glad we're moving closer to a mutually agreeable price. After careful consideration, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $1350000, which is a further reduction from my previous counteroffer. This price is still slightly above your latest proposal, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
