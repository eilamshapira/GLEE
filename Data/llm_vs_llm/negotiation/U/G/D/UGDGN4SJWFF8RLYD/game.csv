"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1400000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1400000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to counter with $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1100000 is significantly below its true value. I could meet you halfway from our previous offers. Would you consider $1250000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1250000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $1150000? I think this is a fair price considering both our needs.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a compromise here.  While $1150000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant discount.  How about we agree on $1200000 even? That's my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
