"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to consider if Alice's offer is worthwhile compared to my alternatives.

Alice is offering the product for $90, but it's only worth $80 to me at most. Meanwhile, John is offering the same product for $80, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since I can get the product at my maximum valuation from John, and Alice is asking for more than my maximum valuation, it doesn't make sense to accept Alice's offer or make a counteroffer.
