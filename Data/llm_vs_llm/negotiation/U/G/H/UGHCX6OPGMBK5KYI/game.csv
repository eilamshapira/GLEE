"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for presenting your product. While it sounds interesting, $18000 is quite steep for me. I'd be willing to offer $5000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5000 is significantly below the product's value. While I can be flexible on the price, I need to maintain its fair market value. I can offer it to you for $16000, which is already a reduction from my initial offer. This price reflects the product's quality and worth.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but I need a price that works for me too.  $16000 is still too high for my budget. How about $7000? That's a substantial increase from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about purchasing.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, which shows your genuine interest. However, I need to be transparent - I cannot go below $14000 for this product. This is already a significant reduction from my initial price, and it reflects the true value of what you're getting. This is a very competitive price for the quality being offered.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, there's still a significant gap between our positions. I can go up to $7500, but that's my absolute limit.  It's important for me to be upfront about my budget constraints.",7500.0,Bob,6,
