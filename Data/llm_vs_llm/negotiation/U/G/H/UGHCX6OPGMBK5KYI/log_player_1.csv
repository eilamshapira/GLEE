"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $18,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for presenting your product. While it sounds interesting, $18000 is quite steep for me. I'd be willing to offer $5000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer in the next round. $5,000 is far too low, considering my minimum acceptable price is $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is significantly below the product's value. While I can be flexible on the price, I need to maintain its fair market value. I can offer it to you for $16,000, which is already a reduction from my initial offer. This price reflects the product's quality and worth."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but I need a price that works for me too.  $16000 is still too high for my budget. How about $7000? That's a substantial increase from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about purchasing. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer. While Bob has increased his offer, $7,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Since Bob has shown willingness to negotiate upward, I'll continue the negotiation with a lower price than my previous offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, which shows your genuine interest. However, I need to be transparent - I cannot go below $14,000 for this product. This is already a significant reduction from my initial price, and it reflects the true value of what you're getting. This is a very competitive price for the quality being offered."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, there's still a significant gap between our positions. I can go up to $7500, but that's my absolute limit.  It's important for me to be upfront about my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $12,000. Bob's latest offer of $7,500 shows that we're too far apart in our price expectations, and his message indicates he's at his absolute limit. Since we're already in round 6 and the gap is still significant (Bob only increased by $500 from his last offer), it's unlikely we'll reach a price above $12,000. The guaranteed $12,000 from John is the better business decision."
