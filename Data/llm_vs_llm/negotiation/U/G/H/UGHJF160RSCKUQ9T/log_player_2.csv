"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer of $2,500,000 because:
1. It's significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,200,000
2. I always have the option to buy from John at $1,200,000
3. I can make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better price from Alice
4. There are still 9 rounds remaining, so there's plenty of time to negotiate"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 800000}

I'll make a counteroffer of $800,000 because:
1. It's well below my maximum value of $1,200,000, giving me room to negotiate upward if needed
2. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $2,500,000, but not so low as to be completely unreasonable
3. Even if Alice counters with a higher price, I still have several rounds to negotiate
4. If negotiations fail, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000"

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer of $2,200,000 because:
1. It's still significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,200,000
2. While Alice has reduced the price by $300,000, it's still nearly double what I can pay
3. John's offer of $1,200,000 remains a better option
4. With 7 rounds remaining, there's still time to negotiate a better price
5. Alice has shown willingness to reduce the price, so further negotiation might be productive"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 950000}

I'll make a counteroffer of $950,000 because:
1. It's a meaningful increase from my previous offer of $800,000, showing I'm willing to negotiate in good faith
2. It's still well below my maximum value of $1,200,000, giving me room to negotiate further if needed
3. Alice has shown willingness to reduce her price (from $2.5M to $2.2M), so I'm also showing movement in her direction
4. It's still gives me significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,200,000
5. Even if Alice rejects this offer, I have several rounds left to continue negotiating or fall back on John's offer"

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer of $1,950,000 because:
1. While Alice continues to lower her price (from $2.2M to $1.95M), it's still well above my maximum value of $1,200,000
2. John's offer of $1,200,000 remains significantly better
3. Alice has shown a pattern of making substantial reductions in price (from $2.5M → $2.2M → $1.95M), suggesting she might be willing to reduce further
4. With 5 rounds remaining, there's still time to continue negotiations
5. The significant price drops suggest we might be able to reach a mutually acceptable price below $1,200,000"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'll make a counteroffer of $1,100,000 because:
1. It's a substantial increase from my previous offer of $950,000, showing continued good faith negotiation
2. It's still below my maximum value of $1,200,000 and below John's offer
3. Alice has consistently shown willingness to reduce her price ($2.5M → $2.2M → $1.95M), so I'm making a larger move to try to meet in the middle
4. If Alice accepts, I'll save $100,000 compared to John's offer
5. Even if Alice rejects this offer, I still have 4 rounds left to negotiate or take John's offer
6. The gap between our offers has decreased significantly (from initial $1.7M gap to current $850K gap), suggesting we might be able to reach agreement"

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John for $1,200,000 because:
1. Alice's latest offer ($1,750,000) is still significantly above my maximum value of $1,200,000
2. While Alice has shown willingness to reduce her price throughout the negotiation, the pace of reduction suggests we're unlikely to reach a price below $1,200,000 in the remaining rounds
3. Even if Alice were to continue reducing her price at the same rate, we would likely not reach a price below John's offer
4. There's a risk in continuing negotiations that we might not reach a deal at all
5. John's offer is guaranteed and matches my maximum acceptable price
6. Taking John's offer now ensures I get the product at an acceptable price without further negotiation risk"
