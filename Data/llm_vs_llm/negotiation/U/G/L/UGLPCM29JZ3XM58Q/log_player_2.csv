"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice's offer is $140
2. My maximum value for the product is $150
3. John's fixed price is $150
4. The product is worth $100 to Alice, so she has room to go lower

Since Alice's price ($140) is below my maximum value ($150) and better than John's price ($150), I could accept it. However, since I know the product costs Alice $100, there's room for negotiation to get a better price. It's worth making a counteroffer since I have John's offer as a backup.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product costs Alice $100, and she offered $140, I'll try to meet somewhere in the middle. I'll offer $120, which gives Alice a $20 profit while saving me $30 compared to her initial offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has moved down from $140 to $135, showing she's willing to negotiate. While this is better than her previous offer and significantly better than John's price ($150), there might still be room for one more negotiation round since her cost is $100. However, I don't want to push too hard and risk losing the progress we've made.

Since she only moved $5 after my $120 offer, she's likely not willing to go much lower. A reasonable compromise might be reachable, but the current offer of $135 is already a good deal compared to my maximum value of $150.
