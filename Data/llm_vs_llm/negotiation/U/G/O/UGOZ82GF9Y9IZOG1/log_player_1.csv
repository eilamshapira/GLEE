"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a great product to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $95. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks Alice, but I think $95 is too high. I'm willing to pay $60 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $60 as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $60 is too low for this product. I have another buyer willing to pay $80, but I'd like to work with you. I can offer it to you for $85, which is a more reasonable price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice, but $85 is still higher than I'm willing to pay. I can offer you $70 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offers remain below my minimum acceptable price of $80, and he doesn't seem willing to increase his offer significantly, I'll take the guaranteed $80 from John. This ensures I get my minimum price and don't risk further rounds of negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome."
