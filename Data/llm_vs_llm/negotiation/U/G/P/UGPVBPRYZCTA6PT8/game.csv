"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is quite high for this product. I know the market value well, and I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. This would still give you a good return while being a fair price for me.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must say that $100 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering the product's value and condition, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer.",125.0,Alice,3,
