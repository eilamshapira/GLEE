Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is quite high for this product. I know the market value well, and I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. This would still give you a good return while being a fair price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
