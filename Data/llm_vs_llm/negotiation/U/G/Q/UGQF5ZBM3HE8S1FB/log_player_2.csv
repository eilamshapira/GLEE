"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The asking price of $15,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's alternative offer ($10,000). It would be irrational to accept this offer when I can either negotiate for a better price or buy from John at a lower price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 8500}

I'll offer $8,500. Here's my reasoning:
1. I know the product is worth $10,000 to Alice
2. I know I can get it for $10,000 from John as my backup option
3. By offering $8,500, I'm giving Alice the opportunity to make a profit ($8,500 > cost to Alice of $8,000)
4. This offer leaves room for potential negotiation while still being a reasonable starting point
5. If Alice rejects this, I can still either negotiate further or go to John as my backup option"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John for $10,000. Here's why:
1. Alice's new offer of $13,000 is still significantly above John's price of $10,000
2. Alice started at $15,000 and only came down to $13,000 after my counteroffer, suggesting she's unlikely to drop the price below John's price
3. Since the product is worth exactly $10,000 to Alice, and she's still asking for significantly more, it seems unlikely we'll reach a mutually beneficial price
4. John's offer of $10,000 is fair and matches my maximum value for the product
5. Continuing negotiations would just waste time when I have a guaranteed acceptable option available"
