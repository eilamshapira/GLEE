"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially setting the price at $1200000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing it further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $1200000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $600000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let me know if this works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600000 is considerably below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. I could consider letting it go for $1000000.  This is a significant reduction, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1000000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700000. This is the maximum I can go while still finding the deal worthwhile. Please let me know if this is something we can work with.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While $700000 is still below my ideal, I'm willing to come down to $900000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise already.",900000.0,Alice,5,
