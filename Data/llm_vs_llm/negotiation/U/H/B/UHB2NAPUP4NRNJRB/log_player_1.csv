"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I get more than my minimum acceptable price of $100.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer ($80) is below my minimum acceptable price ($100) and even below John's guaranteed offer ($100), I will reject this offer. I know I can always get $100 from John, so there's no reason to accept less than that from Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from my initial offer but still keep it well above my minimum to maintain room for negotiation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer ($90) is still below my minimum acceptable price ($100) and below John's guaranteed offer ($100). Since I can guarantee $100 from John, there's no reason to accept less than that amount.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price again but still maintain it above my minimum of $100. Since Bob has made two offers below $100, I'll try to be more reasonable while still ensuring I make more than John's guaranteed offer.

{""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob is now offering $100, which is exactly the same as John's guaranteed offer. Since we're already in round 6 out of 10, and Bob's offers have been gradually increasing but only reached my minimum acceptable price, I think it's best to sell to John now rather than risk more rounds of negotiation that might not lead to a better price.
