"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
Bob's offer of $7000 is below my minimum acceptable value. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round by sending a counteroffer that reflects a price of at least $8000.,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
