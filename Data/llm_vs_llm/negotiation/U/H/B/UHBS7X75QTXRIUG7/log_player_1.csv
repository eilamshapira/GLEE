Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $35000 is significantly above my budget for this product. Based on my market research and needs, I can offer $8000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the current market value. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
