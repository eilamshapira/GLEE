"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to present you with an exclusive offer for our product. Today, I'm offering you the product at an initial price of $35000. I believe this item offers tremendous value and would be a great addition to your portfolio. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $35,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $35,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $35,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $10,000
4. Alice's initial offer is more than 3 times what I'm willing to pay

I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. While I could immediately buy from John, I'll try to negotiate with Alice first to potentially get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $35,000 is significantly above my budget for this product. Based on my market research and needs, I can offer $8,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the current market value. I look forward to your response."", ""product_price"": 8000}"
