Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Okay, considering my options:

*   I can sell to John for $100.
*   I can accept Bob's offer for $100.
*   I can counteroffer.

Since the product is worth at least $100 to me, and I'm aiming for the best possible profit, I will reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```"
