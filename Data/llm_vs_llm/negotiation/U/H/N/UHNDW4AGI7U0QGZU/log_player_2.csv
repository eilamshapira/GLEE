"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Based on the information provided, Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which exceeds the maximum value the product is worth to me ($800,000). Meanwhile, John is offering the same product for $800,000, which is exactly at my maximum valuation.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, the best decision is to buy from John rather than accept Alice's more expensive offer.
