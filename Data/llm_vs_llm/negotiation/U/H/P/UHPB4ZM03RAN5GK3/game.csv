"Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm sure you'll find our price of $12000 quite reasonable.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer, but $12000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go up to $8500. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I appreciate your interest in our product. However, $8500 is a bit lower than what we're aiming for. I can lower our initial price to $11000 Would you be able to meet us halfway at this price?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant about $11000. How about we split the difference and go with $9250? This is really my top limit.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from. However, $9250 is still a bit low for us. I am willing to lower the price a bit more and meet you in the middle, how about $10250? This way, both parties can walk away feeling good about the deal.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10250 is still a little out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $9750. If you're willing to accept that, we can close the deal.",9750.0,Bob,6,
