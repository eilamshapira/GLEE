"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. I'm offering it to you for $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Alice's offer.  $10,000 is my absolute limit, so I need to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $7,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $7000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $8500?  That gives us both some room to maneuver. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Alice's offer.  While $8,500 is better than $10,000, I think I can still get a better price.  I'll counter again."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me. How about $8,000? That's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
