"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $15000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $10000 to me, which is the same price John is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. I'm willing to offer $8000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale while allowing me to save compared to my alternative option.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $8000. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12000, considering the product's value and uniqueness. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a reasonable price. I'm open to further negotiations.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. That shows we're making progress. However, $12000 is still more than I can justify spending, especially when I have an alternative option at $10000 from John. I value doing business with you, but I need to be financially responsible. I can increase my offer to $9000, which is better than my previous offer and would save you the trouble of finding another buyer. This gives you a $1000 premium over what the product is worth to you.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $9000. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your alternative option with John at $10000 and my initial price, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll meet you halfway between my previous offer of $12000 and your current offer of $9000. Let's discuss $10500 as a potential price. This way, you'll still be saving $500 compared to your alternative option, and I'll be getting a fair price for the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your continued negotiation, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to meet me partway. However, I need to be clear that I have a firm alternative at $10000 from John, and that's the maximum value I place on this product. While I'd prefer to do business with you, I can't justify paying more than the product is worth to me. I can offer $9500 as my final offer - this gives you a $500 profit over your cost, while saving me $500 compared to going with John. This creates value for both of us. If we can't agree, I'll need to accept John's offer.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your final offer of $9500. I understand that you have a firm alternative at $10000 from John, and I appreciate your transparency. Considering your willingness to pay up to the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you at that price. I'll sell the product to you for $10000, which matches the value you've stated it's worth to you and saves you the trouble of going with John. This way, we can both walk away satisfied with the deal.",10000.0,Alice,7,
