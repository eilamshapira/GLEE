"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since the offered price of $15,000 is above my maximum budget of $12,000, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price. Buying from John for $12,000 is an option, but I'd like to see if I can get an even better deal from Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since my maximum budget is $12,000, I'll offer a price that is somewhat lower to leave room for negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $14,000 is still above my maximum budget of $12,000. While it's a slight improvement from her initial offer of $15,000, it's not enough to convince me to accept.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to negotiate a better price. Since Alice has already come down by $1,000, I'm hoping she may be willing to come down further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a new counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one, but still below Alice's latest offer. I'm trying to meet Alice halfway and find a mutually acceptable price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $13,000 is still above my maximum budget of $12,000, but it's getting closer. However, I'm not willing to pay more than $12,000 for the product, and I have the option to buy it from John for that price.

At this point, I think it's unlikely that Alice will come down to $12,000 or below, so I'll choose to buy the product from John instead of continuing to negotiate with Alice.
