"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","$1,500,000 is way too high for me, considering the product is only worth up to $800,000 to me. Alice is offering the product at her own valuation, which doesn't account for my budget constraints. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations don't progress well, I always have the option to buy from John at $800,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable initial counteroffer that gives room for negotiation while being fair to both parties.

{""product_price"": $600,000}"
