,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $950000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  While $700000 is less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to move a bit. Let's consider $900000. This product is truly worth the investment, and I'm confident you'll see a significant return.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  However, $900000 is still a stretch. I can do $750000.  This is a serious offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still a little ways off. I can go to $775000. If that works, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider John's offer.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to make one last concession to close this deal. $825000.  This is below my initial asking price and reflects my genuine interest in working with you. Let me know your thoughts.",825000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the further concession.  I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and agree on $800000? That's the highest I can go.",800000.0,Bob,8,
