"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tighter budget. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad you're willing to make an offer. However, $80 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I can do $140, which is the lowest I'm willing to go at this point. Let me know if this works for you.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a fair price for your product. How about we meet in the middle at $110? That's a significant jump from my initial offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $130. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value, and it's a compromise on my end. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",130.0,Alice,5,

"Okay, Alice, I see where you're coming from. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further. How about $115? That's the best I can do.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget. I can see that we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to meet my minimum requirements. How about we do $125? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to finalize the deal at this point.",125.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is my final offer. I can do $120, but I can't go any higher.  It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal right now if you agree.",120.0,Bob,8,
