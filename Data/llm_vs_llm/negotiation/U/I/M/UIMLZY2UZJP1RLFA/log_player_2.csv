"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Analyzing the situation:
- The product is worth at most $8,000 to me (Bob)
- Alice's offer is $10,000, which is higher than my maximum value
- John offers to sell the same product for $8,000

Alice's offer is too high - it exceeds what the product is worth to me. I could make a counteroffer, but I already have an option to buy from John at exactly my maximum value of $8,000. Since Alice's initial offer is at her valuation of $10,000, it suggests she's starting high and negotiations may take multiple rounds to reach an acceptable price.

Given these considerations, the most rational decision is to buy from John.
