"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. Would you like to buy it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $150
2. Alice is offering the product for $120
3. John's price is fixed at $150

Alice's offer at $120 is $30 less than John's price and below my maximum value of $150. This is a good deal that would save me money compared to buying from John.
