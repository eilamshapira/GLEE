Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll prepare an offer for Bob.

Given the information provided, I know that:
- The product is worth at least $8,000 to me
- I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000
- I don't know how much the product is worth to Bob
- I want to maximize my profit

Since I have a guaranteed fallback of $8,000 from John, I'll offer Bob a higher price. I'll set the price at $12,000, which provides a significant markup but might still be reasonable enough that Bob could accept if the product has higher value to him.
