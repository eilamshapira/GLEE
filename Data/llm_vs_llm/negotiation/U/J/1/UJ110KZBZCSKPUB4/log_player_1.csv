Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to set a price that maximizes my profit while still being acceptable to Bob. The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, so that's his ceiling. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price.

I'll start with a price that's below Bob's maximum value but significantly above my reservation price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $11,000 is below even my minimum acceptable value of $12,000 (and below John's guaranteed offer), I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I need to adjust my price since Bob rejected my initial offer. His counteroffer was quite low at $11,000, which is below my minimum acceptable value. Since I have John's guaranteed offer at $12,000, I'll come down from my initial offer but still aim for a price that gives me a good profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $12,500. This is a reasonable compromise that gives me $500 more than John's guaranteed offer of $12,000, and it's above my minimum acceptable value."
