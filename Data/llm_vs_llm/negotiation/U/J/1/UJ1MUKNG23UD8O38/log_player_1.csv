Given that we're in round 6 out of 10, and the increments are getting smaller, this is a reasonable offer that gives us a good profit margin. While we could continue negotiating, there's also a risk of Bob getting frustrated and backing out. I'll accept this offer as it's significantly better than John's $12,000.
