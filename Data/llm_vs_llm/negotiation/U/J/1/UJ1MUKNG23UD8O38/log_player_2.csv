"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully to make the best decision for myself.

Alice is offering the product for $14,500. I know the product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for $15,000. Alice's offer is $500 less than John's price, which is good, but I should try to get an even better deal since Alice's cost is only $12,000.

I'll reject this initial offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This gives me a chance to negotiate a better price while still having John's offer as a backup.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives us both room to negotiate but also provides me with a better deal.

{""product_price"": $13,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her price from $14,500 to $14,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is a good sign, but I can probably get an even better price since her cost is only $12,000. The current offer would give Alice a $2,000 profit margin, while buying from John would cost me an additional $1,000.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. We still have plenty of rounds left to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $13,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her price again to $13,800, which is a good improvement from her previous offers of $14,500 and $14,000. She's now asking $1,800 above her cost of $12,000, while I've moved up to $13,500 in my last counteroffer. We're getting closer to agreement.

Given that:
1. Alice's offer is now $1,200 less than John's price of $15,000
2. We've narrowed the gap between our positions to just $300
3. We still have 5 more potential rounds of negotiation
4. Alice seems to be willing to make meaningful concessions

I'll reject this offer and make one more counteroffer, aiming to meet closer to the middle.
