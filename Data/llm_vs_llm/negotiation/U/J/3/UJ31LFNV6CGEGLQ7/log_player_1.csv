Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about a strategic price for this offer.

Given that:
1. The product is worth at least $8,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer of $8,000 from John
3. I don't know Bob's maximum willingness to pay
4. Bob might be willing to pay significantly more than $8,000

I should aim for a price notably higher than my guaranteed $8,000 from John, but not so high that it would immediately drive Bob away. A reasonable markup would be around 50% above my minimum acceptable price.
