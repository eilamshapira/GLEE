"Hi Bob, I have a product that I'm selling that I believe would be valuable to you. Given its quality and features, I'm offering it to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and benefits. I look forward to your response.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $10000. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, I can't accept $10000 as it's below my minimum threshold. I have another buyer willing to pay $12000, but I'd prefer to work with you. I can come down to $15000, which is a substantial reduction from my initial offer and represents good value for this product. Let me know if this works for you.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11500. If you're serious about selling to me, I think we can find a compromise here.",11500.0,Bob,4,
