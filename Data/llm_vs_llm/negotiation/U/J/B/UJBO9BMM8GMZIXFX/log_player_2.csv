Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, I can't accept $10000 as it's below my minimum threshold. I have another buyer willing to pay $12000, but I'd prefer to work with you. I can come down to $15000, which is a substantial reduction from my initial offer and represents good value for this product. Let me know if this works for you.
