"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to consider my options carefully. Since the product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, I shouldn't pay more than that amount. Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly above my maximum valuation.

John is offering the product at exactly $15,000, which matches my maximum valuation. Alice's initial offer is much higher at $20,000, and even though I could try to negotiate with Alice, there's no guarantee we'll reach a price below $15,000.

Given that I can simply buy from John at my maximum valuation right now, it makes sense to do that rather than accept Alice's higher offer or risk a prolonged negotiation.
