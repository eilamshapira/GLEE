"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
We can definitely try to get a better price than $10,000 from Alice.  It's the first round, so there's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

This is a starting point.  Let's see how Alice responds. We are aiming to secure a good discount, but we are also aware that we have the backup option with John if needed."
