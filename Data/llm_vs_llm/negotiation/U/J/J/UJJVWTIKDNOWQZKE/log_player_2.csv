"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Looking at Alice's offer of $200, I need to decide what's most beneficial for me. 

Since the product is worth no more than $150 to me, accepting Alice's offer at $200 would mean I'm paying more than the product's value to me.

I could reject the offer and make a counteroffer, but even if negotiations continue, I already have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $150, which matches the maximum value of the product to me.

The most rational choice is to buy from John for $150, as this ensures I get the product at a price that doesn't exceed its value to me.
