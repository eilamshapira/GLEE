"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is beyond my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. I will make a counteroffer.
"Thanks for the interest, Bob. I appreciate the offer, but $6000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9000?",9000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Thanks for considering my offer, Alice. I understand your position, but $9000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $7000? I think that's a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",7000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,Bob's offer is still below the value I place on the product. I will counter.
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate that. However, considering the product's value and the demand, I can't go as low as $7000. How about $8500? That's the lowest I can go.",8500.0,Alice,5,,
