Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. Considering its quality and uniqueness, I'm offering it to you for $10,000."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is beyond my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Okay, I have a few options here. I know the product is worth $8,000 to me, and I want to maximize my profit. Bob's offer is too low. I could sell to John for $8,000 right now.

I'll choose to **reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer**.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""reason"": ""Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. I will make a counteroffer.""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the interest, Bob. I appreciate the offer, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for considering my offer, Alice. I understand your position, but $9000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $7000? I think that's a fair price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Okay, Bob is still low, but he's getting closer. I could sell to John for $8,000. I'm also a little concerned about dragging this out too long and losing the sale altogether. $7,000 is below what the product is worth to me, so I will not accept his offer. I also don't want to lose the sale. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and make a new counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""reason"": ""Bob's offer is still below the value I place on the product. I will counter.""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate that. However, considering the product's value and the demand, I can't go as low as $7,000. How about $8,500? That's the lowest I can go."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
