"Alice, I appreciate your interest, but $1500000 is far beyond what I'm willing to pay. Based on my evaluation, I'd be comfortable buying the product for $700000. Let me know if we can work with that.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700000 is significantly lower than I can accept. How about we meet halfway? I'm willing to sell the product for $1250000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1250000 is still above what I'm prepared to pay. Given my alternative option at $1000000, I can offer $900000 for the product. Let me know if we can work with that.",900000.0,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate the back-and-forth. Considering my alternative option with John at $1000000, I can increase my offer slightly. How does $950000 sound? This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach a win-win agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $950000. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I still believe the value of the product is higher. How about we settle at $1100000? This would be a fair compromise and I'm sure you'll find it valuable.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
Alice’s current offer exceeds my alternative option with John. I’ll buy from John at $1000000.,,Bob,5,BuyFromJhon
