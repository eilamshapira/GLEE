"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think would interest you. I'm offering it for $150. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value. Would you like to purchase it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Looking at the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $120 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $150
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $120

Since Alice is offering the product at a price higher than its worth to me ($150 > $120), and John is offering the exact same product at a price equal to its maximum value to me ($120), the rational decision would be to buy from John.
