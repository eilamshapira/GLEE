"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to consider my options carefully here:

1. Accept Alice's offer of $14,000
2. Reject and make a counteroffer
3. Buy from John for $15,000

Alice's product is worth up to $15,000 to me, and her offer is $14,000, which is $1,000 less than my maximum value and $1,000 less than John's price. However, since the product only costs Alice $10,000, there's room for negotiation.

It makes sense to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, as I can potentially save more money. There's no reason to buy from John at $15,000 when Alice is already offering a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but still gives me more savings than Alice's initial offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I see that Alice has lowered her price from $14,000 to $13,000 after rejecting my counteroffer of $11,500. This is good progress in the negotiation.

Alice's product costs her $10,000, and she's now offering it for $13,000, which is $2,000 less than my maximum value and John's price. There may still be room for negotiation, but she's already moved $1,000 in my direction.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, as I believe we can still find a better middle ground.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer to show good faith in the negotiation while still trying to get a better price than Alice's current offer.

{""product_price"": $12,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I see that Alice has moved her price from $13,000 down to $12,500 after I offered $12,000. We're getting much closer to an agreement.

At this point:
- Alice started at $14,000
- She's now at $12,500
- I'm at $12,000
- We're only $500 apart
- Her cost is $10,000, so she's still making a $2,500 profit
- I would save $2,500 compared to buying from John at $15,000

Since we're so close and Alice has come down considerably from her initial offer, I'll accept this offer. Continuing to negotiate for a small additional discount risks Alice walking away, and I'd still be getting a good deal at $12,500.
