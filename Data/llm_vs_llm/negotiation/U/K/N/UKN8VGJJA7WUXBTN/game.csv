"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given the current market conditions and the product's features, I'm offering it to you for $170. This is a fair price considering its value and utility. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?",170.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality and value of the product, but $170 is beyond my budget. I am willing to purchase the product for $70, which I believe is a reasonable price considering other options available to me.",70.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand budget considerations, but I can't go as low as $70 as the product is worth significantly more than that to me. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $150 for it. However, I'd be happy to sell it to you instead for $145, which gives you a better value than what I could get elsewhere. This is as low as I can reasonably go while still making this transaction worthwhile for me.",145.0,Alice,3,
