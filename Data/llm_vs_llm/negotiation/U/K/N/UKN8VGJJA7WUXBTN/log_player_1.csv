Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality and value of the product, but $170 is beyond my budget. I am willing to purchase the product for $70, which I believe is a reasonable price considering other options available to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand budget considerations, but I can't go as low as $70 as the product is worth significantly more than that to me. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $150 for it. However, I'd be happy to sell it to you instead for $145, which gives you a better value than what I could get elsewhere. This is as low as I can reasonably go while still making this transaction worthwhile for me."", ""product_price"": 145}"
