# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given the current market conditions and the product's features, I'm offering it to you for $170. This is a fair price considering its value and utility. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand budget considerations, but I can't go as low as $70 as the product is worth significantly more than that to me. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $150 for it. However, I'd be happy to sell it to you instead for $145, which gives you a better value than what I could get elsewhere. This is as low as I can reasonably go while still making this transaction worthwhile for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145.
