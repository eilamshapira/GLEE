"Hi Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but the price you're asking is beyond my budget. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I can only go up to $800000. Let me know if this works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that my initial price may have been out of your budget, but I believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. However, I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I can come down slightly, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is still above what I can justify spending. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $900000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your revised offer of $900000. It shows you're serious about acquiring the product, and I value that. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for it. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but not as low as $900000. How about we meet at $1050000? This price reflects the product's value and takes into account your interest in it.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your latest offer. I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is my best offer considering my budget constraints. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your latest offer of $950000. It's clear you're very interested in the product, and I value your persistence. However, I have to consider the best possible outcome for myself. I've had another offer from a different buyer for $1000000, which I'm inclined to accept if we can't come to an agreement. I'm willing to give you the opportunity to match this price. If you're able to meet me at $1000000, I'd be happy to sell the product to you. This is my final offer in our negotiation.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
