"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but the price you're asking is beyond my budget. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I can only go up to $800000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us while still aiming to get the best possible price for the product."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that my initial price may have been out of your budget, but I believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. However, I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I can come down slightly, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is still above what I can justify spending. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $900000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Bob's willingness to increase his offer to $900,000 suggests he's interested and sees value in the product. I'll try to meet him closer to the middle while still aiming for the best possible price. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer of $1,050,000, which is slightly lower than my previous offer but still reflects the product's worth to me."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your revised offer of $900,000. It shows you're serious about acquiring the product, and I value that. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for it. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but not as low as $900,000. How about we meet at $1,050,000? This price reflects the product's value and takes into account your interest in it."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your latest offer. I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is my best offer considering my budget constraints. Let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Bob's willingness to increase his offer to $950,000 shows he's very interested, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price I can get. Since I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, I'll try to get closer to that or at least not go below $1,000,000 if possible. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer of $1,000,000, which is a straightforward approach considering John's standing offer. This way, I'm giving Bob a last chance to match the price I can get from another buyer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your latest offer of $950,000. It's clear you're very interested in the product, and I value your persistence. However, I have to consider the best possible outcome for myself. I've had another offer from a different buyer for $1,000,000, which I'm inclined to accept if we can't come to an agreement. I'm willing to give you the opportunity to match this price. If you're able to meet me at $1,000,000, I'd be happy to sell the product to you. This is my final offer in our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
