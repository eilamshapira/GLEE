Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to provide an initial offer to Bob that balances being profitable for me while still giving him room to accept without feeling like he's paying too much.

The product is worth $100 to me and $150 to Bob. I want to earn more than my minimum of $100, but if I start too high, Bob might immediately reject. I'll start with an offer that gives us both some value from the transaction.

{""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
