"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but my budget is quite limited. I have an alternative offer at $12000, so I'm prepared to move forward if you can accept $10000 for the product. Let me know your thoughts.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you have a limited budget, but I believe the product's value is higher than $10000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a better price. Let's meet in the middle - I can offer you a discount from my initial price, but I still need to get at least $18000 for the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
