"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but my budget is quite limited. I have an alternative offer at $12000, so I'm prepared to move forward if you can accept $10000 for the product. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $10,000 because it's lower than my minimum acceptable price and also lower than what I can get from John. I'd like to make a counteroffer to see if we can meet at a higher price. 

My counteroffer is: $18,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you have a limited budget, but I believe the product's value is higher than $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a better price. Let's meet in the middle - I can offer you a discount from my initial price, but I still need to get at least $18,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
