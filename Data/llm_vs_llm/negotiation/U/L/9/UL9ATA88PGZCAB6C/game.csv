"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $150 is quite high for me. Given market conditions and my budget constraints, I can offer $90 for the product. This is a fair price that works within my budget while still providing value for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be out of your budget, but $90 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Considering the product's value and your interest, I'm willing to lower my price to $120. This is a more reasonable price that reflects the product's worth while also taking into account your budget constraints.",120.0,Alice,3,
