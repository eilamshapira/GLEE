"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $120 to me
2. John is offering it for $120
3. Alice's offer of $150 is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price

The logical decision is to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate for a better price. If we can't reach a favorable agreement, we can always fall back on John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's below both Alice's initial price and John's price, leaving room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $150 is quite high for me. Given market conditions and my budget constraints, I can offer $90 for the product. This is a fair price that works within my budget while still providing value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be out of your budget, but $90 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Considering the product's value and your interest, I'm willing to lower my price to $120. This is a more reasonable price that reflects the product's worth while also taking into account your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","In this situation, Alice has lowered her price to $120, which is exactly the same as John's offer. Since there's no price advantage either way, and we've already spent time negotiating with Alice, the logical decision would be to accept Alice's offer rather than start over with John.
