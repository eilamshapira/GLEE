"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique nature, I'm offering it to you first at a price of $15000.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer, reject it, or buy from John.

Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which is exactly equal to:
1. The maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($15,000)
2. The price John is willing to sell it for ($15,000)

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price, and that price is at my maximum valuation, I'm indifferent between the two sellers. There's no monetary advantage to choosing one over the other.

Given that I need the product and both offers are at my maximum acceptable price, I'll accept Alice's offer since she approached me first.
