"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given the information:
- The product is worth at most $8,000 to me (Bob)
- Alice's offer is $12,000
- John is willing to sell the same product for $8,000

Alice's initial offer of $12,000 exceeds both my valuation of the product ($8,000) and the alternative option from John ($8,000). It wouldn't make financial sense to accept this offer.

I could make a counteroffer to Alice, but since John is already offering the product at my maximum valuation price, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice unless I believe she would accept a price significantly below $8,000.

The most rational choice is to buy from John.
