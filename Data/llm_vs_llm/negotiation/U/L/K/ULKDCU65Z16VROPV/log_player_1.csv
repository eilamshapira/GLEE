"Round 1

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll reject Bob's offer since it's significantly below even my minimum acceptable price (the price John is willing to pay). Bob's offer of $800,000 is $400,000 less than John's guaranteed offer, so it's not acceptable.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round, lowering my initial price but still keeping it well above John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still maintain a price significantly above John's guaranteed $1,200,000 to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll reject Bob's offer since it's still $200,000 below John's guaranteed price of $1,200,000. There's no reason to accept less than what I can definitely get from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, but if Bob doesn't come above John's price soon, I may choose to sell to John instead of continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my previous offer but keep it above John's price to show I'm willing to negotiate while maintaining a profitable position.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll reject Bob's offer. While Bob is getting closer to John's price, it's still $50,000 less than what I can get from John. Since we're already in round 6 out of 10, and Bob's increases have been relatively small, it's safer to reject and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make another counteroffer, but if Bob doesn't exceed John's price soon, I'll likely sell to John rather than risk running out of rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since we're in round 7 and time is running out, I'll make a more modest counteroffer to clearly signal my minimum expectations while still leaving some room for negotiation.
