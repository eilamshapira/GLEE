"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000), I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. There's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice, and if that doesn't work out, I can always buy from John later.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. Since my maximum value is $1,200,000 (which is also John's price), I'll start with a lower offer to give room for back-and-forth negotiation.

{""product_price"": 800000}

This offer is strategically chosen because:
1. It's well below my maximum value and John's price
2. It leaves room for negotiation upward
3. It's not so low as to be considered unreasonable given the price range we're discussing
4. If Alice counters, we can potentially meet somewhere below $1,200,000, which would be better than buying from John"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced her price from $2,000,000 to $1,700,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $1,700,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value and John's price of $1,200,000. Since there are still several rounds left for negotiation, and Alice has shown willingness to lower her price, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down $300,000 from her initial offer, I'll increase my previous offer to show I'm also willing to negotiate. However, I need to stay well below my maximum value of $1,200,000 to maintain room for further negotiation.

{""product_price"": 1000000}

This offer is strategic because:
1. It shows good faith by increasing my previous offer by $200,000
2. It's still below my maximum value and John's price of $1,200,000
3. It signals I'm willing to negotiate but also that I have alternatives (like buying from John)
4. It leaves room for further negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to John's offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has lowered her price again to $1,500,000, showing continued willingness to negotiate. However, this is still above both my maximum value and John's price of $1,200,000. Since Alice has been consistently lowering her price and we still have several rounds left, I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has reduced her price by $200,000 in her last offer, showing she's willing to make meaningful reductions. I'll increase my offer again to show continued good faith in negotiations, but I'll stay under my maximum value.

{""product_price"": 1150000}

This offer is strategic because:
1. It's a significant increase from my last offer ($150,000 more), showing serious intent
2. It's slightly below John's price of $1,200,000, giving me a small advantage if accepted
3. It signals that I'm getting close to my maximum value
4. If Alice rejects this, I still have the option to buy from John at $1,200,000
5. The gap between our offers has narrowed considerably, which might help reach a deal"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","While Alice continues to lower her price, $1,350,000 is still above John's price of $1,200,000. Since I can get the same product from John for $1,200,000, and that's also my maximum value, it would be more rational to buy from John at this point. Further negotiation might not yield a better result, and we're running out of rounds.
