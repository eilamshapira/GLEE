"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $160 for it. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! The product sounds interesting, but $160 is way too high for me. I'm only willing to pay a maximum of $100 for this product, considering I can get it from John for that price. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $160 is my initial offer, and I'm not willing to go as low as $100.  Could you meet me halfway at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks, Alice, but $130 is still too high. I value the product at a maximum of $100, and that's what John is offering.  I'm willing to go a little higher, but my final offer is $105.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $120? This is my final offer.",120.0,Alice,5,
