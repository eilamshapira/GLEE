"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of you acquiring this truly unique and valuable product. I'm confident it will be a significant asset for you. To begin, I'm offering it to you for $25000.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out, but I must say your asking price of $25000 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. This product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's offering it for exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to offer $5000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without the hassle of finding another buyer.",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that price is important, but consider the long-term benefits this product offers. I'm coming down significantly from my initial offer. How about $20000?",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $20000 is still well beyond what makes sense for me. As I mentioned, this product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I have John's offer at exactly that price. I'm negotiating with you because I'd prefer to do business with you, but I can't justify paying more than the product's value to me. I could go up to $5500, which gives you a quick sale today without having to find another buyer. If we can't reach an agreement closer to my budget, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer.",5500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $16000? I think that reflects the unique qualities and advantages this product offers. This is as low as I can reasonably go while still recognizing the inherent value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price. However, $16000 is still double what the product is worth to me. I need to be clear: this product has a maximum value of $8000 to me, which happens to be exactly what John is offering. I'm still hoping we can do business together, but I can't pay more than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to offer $6000, which is below John's price and would give you a guaranteed sale today. If we can't reach an agreement near this range, I'll need to go with John's offer as the financially responsible choice.",6000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here. Let's meet closer to the middle. My offer is $13000. This is the last big drop I can realistically make. Think about it â€“ you're getting a truly valuable product for a significantly reduced price. Are you sure it's only worth $8000 to you? Consider the potential upside and the unique benefits it offers.",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but I need to be very clear about my position. The product is worth exactly $8000 to me - that's my absolute maximum. This isn't a negotiating tactic; it's simply the reality of my situation and the product's value to me. John is offering it at precisely that price, which means I have no incentive to pay more. I'm willing to offer $6500 to conclude our deal today, which is below what I could pay elsewhere. If we can't come to an agreement near this price point, I'll have to go with John's offer, as paying more than $8000 would be financially irrational for me. I hope you understand my position.",6500.0,Bob,8,
