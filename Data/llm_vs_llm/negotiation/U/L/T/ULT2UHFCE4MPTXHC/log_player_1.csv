Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out, but I must say your asking price of $25000 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. This product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's offering it for exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to offer $5000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without the hassle of finding another buyer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $20000 is still well beyond what makes sense for me. As I mentioned, this product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I have John's offer at exactly that price. I'm negotiating with you because I'd prefer to do business with you, but I can't justify paying more than the product's value to me. I could go up to $5500, which gives you a quick sale today without having to find another buyer. If we can't reach an agreement closer to my budget, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,500

{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for your continued interest. While I understand your perspective, I also have alternative buyers. Selling for $5,500 is not an option for me. I'm willing to meet you somewhere in the middle to make this work for both of us. My counteroffer is $18,000. This is a significant drop and I believe reflects my commitment to closing this deal with you. Please consider the value I offer compared to John. "", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $16,000? I think that reflects the unique qualities and advantages this product offers.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price. However, $16000 is still double what the product is worth to me. I need to be clear: this product has a maximum value of $8000 to me, which happens to be exactly what John is offering. I'm still hoping we can do business together, but I can't pay more than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to offer $6000, which is below John's price and would give you a guaranteed sale today. If we can't reach an agreement near this range, I'll need to go with John's offer as the financially responsible choice. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the clarity. However, I'm finding it hard to reconcile your valuation with what I know the product is worth. While I want to make this work, I cannot accept $6,000. My lowest acceptable offer at this point is $14,000. This is a firm offer. I believe it's a fair price, considering the benefits you'll derive. Please give it serious consideration. It would be difficult to go any lower."", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here. Let's meet closer to the middle. My offer is $13,000. This is the last big drop I can realistically make.

Consider the potential upside and the unique benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but I need to be very clear about my position. The product is worth exactly $8000 to me - that's my absolute maximum. This isn't a negotiating tactic; it's simply the reality of my situation and the product's value to me. John is offering it at precisely that price, which means I have no incentive to pay more. I'm willing to offer $6500 to conclude our deal today, which is below what I could pay elsewhere. If we can't come to an agreement near this price point, I'll have to go with John's offer, as paying more than $8000 would be financially irrational for me. I hope you understand my position.
