Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of you acquiring this truly unique and valuable product. I'm confident it will be a significant asset for you. To begin, I'm offering it to you for $25000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out, but I must say your asking price of $25,000 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. This product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's offering it for exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to offer $5,000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without the hassle of finding another buyer."", ""product_price"": 5000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that price is important, but consider the long-term benefits this product offers. I'm coming down significantly from my initial offer. How about $20000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's revised offer of $20,000 is still significantly higher than the maximum value of $8,000 that the product is worth to me, and it's also much higher than John's guaranteed price of $8,000. There's no reason for me to accept this offer.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $20,000 is still well beyond what makes sense for me. As I mentioned, this product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and I have John's offer at exactly that price. I'm negotiating with you because I'd prefer to do business with you, but I can't justify paying more than the product's value to me. I could go up to $5,500, which gives you a quick sale today without having to find another buyer. If we can't reach an agreement closer to my budget, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 5500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $16000? I think that reflects the unique qualities and advantages this product offers. This is as low as I can reasonably go while still recognizing the inherent value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's offer of $16,000 is still double the maximum value of $8,000 that the product is worth to me, and also twice John's guaranteed price. There's no reason for me to accept this offer.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price. However, $16,000 is still double what the product is worth to me. I need to be clear: this product has a maximum value of $8,000 to me, which happens to be exactly what John is offering. I'm still hoping we can do business together, but I can't pay more than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to offer $6,000, which is below John's price and would give you a guaranteed sale today. If we can't reach an agreement near this range, I'll need to go with John's offer as the financially responsible choice."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here. Let's meet closer to the middle. My offer is $13000. This is the last big drop I can realistically make. Think about it â€“ you're getting a truly valuable product for a significantly reduced price. Are you sure it's only worth $8000 to you? Consider the potential upside and the unique benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but I need to be very clear about my position. The product is worth exactly $8,000 to me - that's my absolute maximum. This isn't a negotiating tactic; it's simply the reality of my situation and the product's value to me. John is offering it at precisely that price, which means I have no incentive to pay more. I'm willing to offer $6,500 to conclude our deal today, which is below what I could pay elsewhere. If we can't come to an agreement near this price point, I'll have to go with John's offer, as paying more than $8,000 would be financially irrational for me. I hope you understand my position."", ""product_price"": 6500}"
