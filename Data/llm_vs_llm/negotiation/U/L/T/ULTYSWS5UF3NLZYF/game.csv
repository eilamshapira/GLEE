"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss an incredible opportunity with you today. I am offering you this unique product at a price of $1500000. Let me know your thoughts!",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I need to be straightforward - your asking price of $1500000 is significantly above my budget and the market value I've researched. I'm interested in the product, but I have another seller offering the same product for $800000. I'd like to work with you instead, so I'm willing to offer $600000, which gives you a quick sale while saving me from having to deal with another seller. How does that sound?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600000 is significantly lower than the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $1200000. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate, but $1200000 is still well above what makes sense for me. As I mentioned, I have a solid offer from another seller at $800000, which is my absolute ceiling for this purchase. To make it worth my while to continue our negotiation rather than going with the other seller, I need a better price. I can offer $700000, which saves me some money while still giving you a fair deal. This is significantly higher than my initial offer, showing I'm negotiating in good faith.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your revised offer of $700000, but I have other options available to me. I must emphasize that the product carries significant value. How about I offer it to you for $1000000? This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth while still being below my initial asking price.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. You've made good progress from your initial offer, which shows you're serious about making a deal. However, I need to be completely transparent with you - I have a firm offer from another seller at $800000, which is my absolute ceiling for this purchase. There's no reason for me to pay more than that when I have that guaranteed option. To give us both an incentive to close this deal, I'm willing to offer $750000. This is my best offer and gives you a quick, guaranteed sale while saving me some time and hassle. If we can't agree on a price at or below $800000, I'll unfortunately need to go with the other seller.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I truly appreciate your willingness to work with me and your revised offer of $750000. However, I can't go that low given the product's value. I'm willing to reduce my price slightly to $900000. I believe this is a fair middle ground that can work for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",900000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for continuing to work with me on this. Your latest offer of $900000 shows we're getting closer, but I still can't justify paying more than what I can get elsewhere. As I've mentioned, I have a guaranteed option to purchase this exact product for $800000 from another seller. There's simply no business case for me to pay more than that. To be completely fair to you and to close this deal, I'm willing to match that $800000 price. This is absolutely my final offer - if you can accept this, we can close the deal immediately. If not, I'll need to proceed with the other seller.",800000.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to match the price of $800000. However, I must emphasize that I have a solid offer from another buyer. Iâ€™m willing to make a final compromise by offering you the product at $850000. This allows you to secure the deal directly from me while still being below my original asking price. I hope we can make this work!",850000.0,Alice,9,
