"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Looking at Alice's offer, she wants to sell the product for $2,000,000. This is $500,000 more than the product is worth to me ($1,500,000). 

Since John is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $1,500,000, which matches the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, it makes the most sense to buy from John rather than accept Alice's inflated price or enter a negotiation that may not result in a price below $1,500,000.
