"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I see that Alice is offering the product for $150, which is the same price as John's offer. Since the product is worth no more than $150 to me, and both Alice and John are offering the same price, there's no advantage in accepting Alice's current offer.

I could reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer at a lower price. This gives me a chance to potentially save some money if Alice accepts my lower counteroffer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has now offered $125, which is $25 less than both her initial offer and John's price of $150. This is a good improvement and represents significant savings. However, there might still be room for negotiation to get an even better price.

Since Alice dropped her price by $25, it suggests she has some flexibility. I'll accept this offer as it's a clear savings compared to John's price.
