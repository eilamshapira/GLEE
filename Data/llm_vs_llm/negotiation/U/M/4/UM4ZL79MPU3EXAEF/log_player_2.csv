"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer ($200) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120), it wouldn't make sense to accept it. Given that John offers the product at $120, which is equal to my maximum value, I should try to negotiate with Alice first to see if I can get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's $200 but still leaves room for negotiation. Since my maximum is $120 (which is also John's price), I'll start low to have room for bargaining.

{""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $180 is still well above both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120). While Alice has reduced the price from her initial offer of $200, it's still not competitive with John's price. However, I'll reject and try one more counter-offer before potentially going with John's option.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $200 to $180, showing some willingness to negotiate, I'll increase my previous offer somewhat but still stay well below my maximum value to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's offer of $150 is still above both my maximum value ($120) and John's guaranteed price ($120). While Alice has shown significant movement in the price (from $200 to $180 to $150), there's no reason for me to pay more than what John is offering. At this point, since we've gone through several rounds and Alice is still above John's price, it makes more sense to take John's offer.
