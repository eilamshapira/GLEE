"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $2,000,000, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer. Additionally, I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within my budget, but I'd like to try to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I know the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, I'll make a counteroffer that is halfway between $0 and $1,000,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer is still above my budget of $1,000,000. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is a better deal for me, I don't see a reason to continue negotiating with Alice at this point.
