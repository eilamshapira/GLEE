Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $2,500,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must point out that the price you're asking is significantly above my budget. I have another seller, John, who's offering the same product for $1500000. I'd like to do business with you instead, so I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale while allowing me to stay within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about having another option, but I must emphasize the value and uniqueness of the product I'm offering. While I understand that $2,500,000 might be above your budget, I'm not comfortable selling it for $1,200,000. Considering your interest in doing business with me, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer the product to you for $2,000,000, which is still a competitive price given its worth."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice. However, $2000000 is still well above what makes financial sense for me. As I mentioned, I have John's offer at $1500000, which is my absolute ceiling for this purchase. To make doing business with you worthwhile, I need a better price than my alternative. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1350000, which would save you the trouble of finding another buyer while giving me a small advantage over my current alternative. If we can't reach an agreement below $1500000, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, and I understand the constraints you're working with. However, I still believe the product's value warrants a higher price. Given that you've mentioned $1,500,000 as your absolute ceiling, I'm willing to meet you closer to that point. I can offer the product to you for $1,475,000, which is a significant concession on my part. This price still gives you a better deal than going with John's offer, while allowing me to feel more comfortable with the sale."", ""product_price"": 1475000}"
