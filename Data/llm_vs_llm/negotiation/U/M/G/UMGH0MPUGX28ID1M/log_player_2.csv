"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $2500000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is asking for $2,500,000, which exceeds the $1,500,000 maximum value the product has to me. Since John is willing to sell me the same product for $1,500,000, there's no reason for me to accept Alice's current offer.

I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can negotiate a better price than John's.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must point out that the price you're asking is significantly above my budget. I have another seller, John, who's offering the same product for $1,500,000. I'd like to do business with you instead, so I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale while allowing me to stay within my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about having another option, but I must emphasize the value and uniqueness of the product I'm offering. While I understand that $2500000 might be above your budget, I'm not comfortable selling it for $1200000. Considering your interest in doing business with me, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer the product to you for $2000000, which is still a competitive price given its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has reduced her price to $2,000,000, which is still significantly above John's price of $1,500,000 and above the maximum value the product has to me. Given that I have a reliable alternative at $1,500,000, there's no reason to accept this offer.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a price below John's.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice. However, $2,000,000 is still well above what makes financial sense for me. As I mentioned, I have John's offer at $1,500,000, which is my absolute ceiling for this purchase. To make doing business with you worthwhile, I need a better price than my alternative. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000, which would save you the trouble of finding another buyer while giving me a small advantage over my current alternative. If we can't reach an agreement below $1,500,000, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, and I understand the constraints you're working with. However, I still believe the product's value warrants a higher price. Given that you've mentioned $1500000 as your absolute ceiling, I'm willing to meet you closer to that point. I can offer the product to you for $1475000, which is a significant concession on my part. This price still gives you a better deal than going with John's offer, while allowing me to feel more comfortable with the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has now offered $1,475,000, which is below John's price of $1,500,000 by $25,000. This offer is within my maximum value threshold of $1,500,000 and actually saves me money compared to my alternative option with John. While I could try to negotiate further, this is already a reasonable deal that provides me savings.

I'll accept this offer as it meets my criteria of being below my maximum value and saves me money compared to my alternative.
