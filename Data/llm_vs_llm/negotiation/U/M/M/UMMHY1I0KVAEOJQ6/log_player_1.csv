Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'd like to start the negotiation at $14,500."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the starting point, but I need to stay within my budget. I would like to offer $13000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $13,000 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($12,000), but lower than my initial offer ($14,500), I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

My counteroffer will be $13,750, which is still lower than the initial offer but higher than Bob's offer, to see if we can meet in the middle.

So, my decision is to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 13750}"
