"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer ($2,000,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's alternative offer ($1,000,000), the logical choice is to buy from John. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer when I can get the same product for half the price from John.
