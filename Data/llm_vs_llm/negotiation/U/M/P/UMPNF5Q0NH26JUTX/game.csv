"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and consider a price that's more reasonable for both of us. How about we try $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $120 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $90, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to accept that?",90.0,Bob,4,
