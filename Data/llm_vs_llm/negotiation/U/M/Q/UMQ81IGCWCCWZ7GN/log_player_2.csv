"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to present you with a unique opportunity to purchase a premium product that I believe could greatly benefit you. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. I think this is a fair price given its exceptional value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is higher than both:
1. The maximum value the product is worth to me ($1,000,000)
2. John's offering price ($1,000,000)

The logical choice is to buy from John.
