"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is higher than the maximum amount the product is worth to me ($1,000,000) and also higher than John's offer of $1,000,000, the rational decision would be to buy from John.
