"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I was hoping we could find a bit more room on the price. Would you be open to $85? The product looks good, but I have a limited budget for this purchase.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and thank you for your offer. While I understand you have a budget constraint, $85 is a bit too low for the quality of this product. I can come down from my initial price, but I would need $105 for it. This is already a significant reduction from my original offer, and I believe it represents a fair value given the product's quality.",105.0,Alice,3,
