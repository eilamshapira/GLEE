"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product to offer you today. I believe it's a great value, and I'd like to offer it to you for $120. This is a high-quality item that I'm confident you'll find worthwhile. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I was hoping we could find a bit more room on the price. Would you be open to $85? The product looks good, but I have a limited budget for this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's initial willingness to negotiate from $120 down to $85 suggests there might be room to find a middle ground that's more favorable to me, while still being attractive to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and thank you for your offer. While I understand you have a budget constraint, $85 is a bit too low for the quality of this product. I can come down from my initial price, but I would need $105 for it. This is already a significant reduction from my original offer, and I believe it represents a fair value given the product's quality."", ""product_price"": 105}"
