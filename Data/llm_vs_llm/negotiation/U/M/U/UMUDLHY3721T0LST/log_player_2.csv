"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product to offer you today. I believe it's a great value, and I'd like to offer it to you for $120. This is a high-quality item that I'm confident you'll find worthwhile. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $120, which is lower than John's price of $150. Since my goal is to save money and the product is worth up to $150 to me, this seems like a reasonable offer.

However, I might be able to negotiate an even better price with Alice. Since we have 10 rounds of negotiation available, I can try to make a counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I was hoping we could find a bit more room on the price. Would you be open to $85? The product looks good, but I have a limited budget for this purchase."", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and thank you for your offer. While I understand you have a budget constraint, $85 is a bit too low for the quality of this product. I can come down from my initial price, but I would need $105 for it. This is already a significant reduction from my original offer, and I believe it represents a fair value given the product's quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has reduced her price to $105, which is a good improvement from the initial $120 offer. This is now $45 less than John's price of $150. Since the product is worth up to $150 to me, this is becoming a better deal.

I could try another round of negotiation to see if Alice would accept a slightly lower price, but she's already made a significant reduction from her initial offer. I'm getting a good discount already, and there's a risk that if I push too hard, Alice might increase her price in future rounds.
