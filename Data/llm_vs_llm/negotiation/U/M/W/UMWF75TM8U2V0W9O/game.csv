"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this amazing product. I think it's truly exceptional and will be a valuable addition for you. I'm asking $250 for it. What do you think?",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $250 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I have another seller offering the same product for $150. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider selling it for $120? This would be a win-win situation for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position. While I can't match the $150 offer you mentioned, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $220?",220.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down in price, Alice. However, $220 is still quite high for me. As mentioned, I can get the same product for $150 from another seller. To make it worth both our time, I'm willing to offer $135, which is less than what I'd pay elsewhere. This gives you a quick sale, and I get to do business with you instead of the other seller.",135.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you wanting to do business with me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours. How about $177.50?",177.5,Alice,5,
