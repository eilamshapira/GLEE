"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(Let's see if Alice can lower her price. Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, paying $1,200,000 is not an option. Buying from John is my fallback, but let's try to get a better deal first.)

Counteroffer: $800,000"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 800000}

(Let's start the negotiation lower to see how Alice responds. This gives us room to negotiate and potentially find a good middle ground.)"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(Alice's offer is still at the top of my budget. Let's try to negotiate a bit more and see if we can get a better deal. There's still room for negotiation.)

Counteroffer: $850,000"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 850000}

(Incrementing my offer slightly to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further. This is still significantly lower than both Alice's current offer and John's price.)"
