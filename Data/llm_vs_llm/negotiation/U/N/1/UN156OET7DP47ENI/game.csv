"Alice, while I recognize the value of this product, $2500000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it, which is still a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. However, given the product's value, I'm afraid $1000000 is too low for us to consider. We're willing to lower our asking price to $2000000 to meet you halfway. Please let me know if you can accommodate this counteroffer.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2000000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1500000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents the absolute maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to discussing this.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
