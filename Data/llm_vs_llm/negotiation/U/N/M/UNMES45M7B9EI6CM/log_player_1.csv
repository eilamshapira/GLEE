"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start by making a relatively high offer to maximize my potential earnings. I can always adjust my price later based on Bob's response.

{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $6,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, I will reject his offer. Selling the product to John for $8,000 is a safer option, but I still want to try to negotiate a better price with Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $6,000, which is below my minimum acceptable price, I'll make a counteroffer that is still relatively high, but slightly lower than my initial offer. This will give Bob an opportunity to reconsider and potentially meet me in the middle.

{""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer of $7,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it's getting closer. Since I have the option to sell to John for $8,000, I'll reject Bob's offer again and try to negotiate a better price. However, I'll keep in mind that I don't want to risk losing the sale, so I'll consider making a more reasonable counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $7,000, which is close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly above $8,000. This will give me some room for further negotiation and potentially get a better price.
