Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $60 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $120, and I have the option to sell to John for $120, I will not accept Bob's offer.

However, I still want to try to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $60, I'll try to find a middle ground while still aiming to earn as much as possible. I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than my initial offer of $200, but still higher than Bob's offer.

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, hoping that Bob will increase his offer or that we can find a mutually beneficial price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer increased from $60 to $70, it shows that he's willing to negotiate. I'll try to find a balance between my initial offer and Bob's increasing offers. I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than my previous offer of $180, but still reflects the value I think the product is worth.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer of $75 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $120. At this point, I'm not seeing a strong willingness from Bob to meet me at a price that I'm comfortable with.

Given that I have the option to sell to John for $120, which is a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum value, I'm starting to think that it might be the best option.

However, I'll give Bob one more chance to increase his offer. If he's not willing to meet me at a higher price, I'll likely sell to John.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer increased to $75, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous one, but still reflects the value I think the product is worth. I'll try to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go too low.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer of $78 is still lower than my minimum value of $120. At this point, I've made several counteroffers, and Bob hasn't shown a willingness to meet me at a price that I'm comfortable with.

With only two rounds left, I'm starting to think that it's unlikely that Bob will increase his offer to a price that I'm willing to accept. Given that I have the option to sell to John for $120, which is a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum value, I think it's time to consider that option seriously.

However, I'll give Bob one more chance to increase his offer significantly. If he's not willing to meet me at a higher price, I'll likely sell to John.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer increased to $78, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous one, but still reflects the value I think the product is worth. I'll try to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go too low. This is the second-to-last round, so I'll aim for a price that's closer to my minimum value of $120.
