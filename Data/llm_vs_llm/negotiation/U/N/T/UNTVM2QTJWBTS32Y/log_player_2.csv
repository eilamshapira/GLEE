"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","The price Alice is offering ($200) is significantly above the maximum value of $80 that the product is worth to me. It also exceeds John's price of $80, making it not a good deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I need to make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice. Since the product is worth no more than $80 to me (and John is selling it for exactly $80), I'll start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": $60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $180 is still much higher than both the product's worth to me ($80) and John's price ($80). It's still not a good deal for me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has come down from $200 to $180, which shows some willingness to negotiate, but we're still far apart. I'll increase my offer slightly to show good faith, but still keep it below the $80 maximum I'm willing to pay.

{""product_price"": $70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's offer of $160 is still significantly above the $80 maximum value to me and John's price. While Alice is gradually reducing the price, we're still not close to a reasonable deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I see that Alice is gradually coming down in price ($200 → $180 → $160), but we're still far from my maximum of $80. I need to communicate that I have a strong alternative option without moving my price too much. I'll increase my offer just slightly.

{""product_price"": $75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's offer is still $150, which is well above the $80 maximum value to me and John's price. While Alice continues to lower her price, the gap remains too large to accept.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice continues to lower her price but we're still far apart. I need to be more direct about my alternative option and my maximum value.

{""product_price"": $78}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's offer of $130 is still significantly higher than John's price of $80. Since I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $80, and this is our 9th round with Alice still far above my maximum, it makes more sense to go with the better option.
