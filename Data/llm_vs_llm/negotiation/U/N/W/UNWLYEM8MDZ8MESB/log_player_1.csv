"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $50 is too low for me. I'm hoping to find a mutually beneficial price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be a bit high, but $50 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Let's try to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $150 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer, hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.

You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

$70 is still too low for me. I'll make another counteroffer, trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me at a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $70 is still a bit far from what I'm looking for. I'm trying to be flexible, so I'll make a slightly lower offer than before. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the slight reduction in price. However, $140 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

$75 is still too low for me. Although Bob is trying to meet me halfway, the price is not close enough to what I'm looking for. I'll try to make another counteroffer, but I'm also considering the option to sell to John for $120 if the negotiation doesn't progress significantly."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your efforts. However, $75 is still a bit too low for me.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm getting close to my limit, but I'd like to make one more counteroffer. If we can't agree, I may need to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

$80 is still too low for me, and I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm also aware that I have a guaranteed offer of $120 from John, which is higher than Bob's current offer. I'll make one more counteroffer to Bob, but if it's not accepted, I'll likely sell to John."

I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. This is my final offer before I consider other options.
