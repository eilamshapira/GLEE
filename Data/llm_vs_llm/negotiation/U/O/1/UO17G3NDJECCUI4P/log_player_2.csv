"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering my premium product to you for $1499999. This product is in high demand, and I have another buyer willing to purchase it at a competitive price. I believe this offer provides excellent value for you. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,499,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,499,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $1,499,999 exceeds that value, it would be financially beneficial for me to explore the alternative option of buying from John at a lower price.
