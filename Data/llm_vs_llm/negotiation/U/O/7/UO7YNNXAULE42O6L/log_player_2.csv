You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($800,000), it's not a good deal for me.

I'll choose option (2) and reject Alice's offer, then proceed to make a counteroffer to try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm not sure what Alice's bottom line is, I'll start with a relatively low offer and see how she responds.

I'll choose option (2) and reject Alice's offer again, then proceed to make another counteroffer. I'll try to meet Alice halfway between my previous offer and her new offer.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I've been trying to negotiate with her for a while now, and I don't think she's going to come down to my target price.

At this point, I think it's best to just buy the product from John for $800,000. It's a guaranteed good deal, and I won't have to waste any more time negotiating with Alice.
