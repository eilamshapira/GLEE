Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and even my own minimum ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting high, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate. The message explicitly mentions this. 
* **Alternative Option:** I know I have John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000. This gives me leverage in the negotiation, as I don't *have* to accept a low offer from Bob."
