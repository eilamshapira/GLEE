"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it for $25000. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Given that the product is worth no more than $15,000 to you, and John is willing to sell it to you for exactly $15,000, Alice's offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than both your maximum value and your alternative option.

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at $25,000 when you can get the same product from John for $15,000. You could try to negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, but since you already have a guaranteed option at your maximum value point, the rational choice is to go with John's offer.
