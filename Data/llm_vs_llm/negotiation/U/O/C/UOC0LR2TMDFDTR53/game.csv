"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand that the product is rare and in good condition, but I still think $1600000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. I'd like to propose a price of $1300000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $1300000. I'm willing to make a small concession to try to reach an agreement. I'd like to propose a price of $1550000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and the compromise you're looking for.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to make a concession. However, I'm still not comfortable with a price above $1400000. I'd like to propose a price of $1400000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options, including purchasing from another seller.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
