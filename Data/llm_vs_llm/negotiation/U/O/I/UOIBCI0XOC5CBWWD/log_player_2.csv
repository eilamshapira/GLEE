"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $150, there's no reason to accept Alice's first offer. Let's see if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a significant discount to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $100 is a good starting point to gauge her willingness to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than Alice's initial offer, I'm still hoping to get a better price. Let's see if we can push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, but still aiming to stay below my maximum budget. Hopefully, this shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating but not willing to overpay."
