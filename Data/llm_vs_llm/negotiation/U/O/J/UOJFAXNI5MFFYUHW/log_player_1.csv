Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob.

Given that:
- The product is worth at least $150 to me
- The product is worth $80 to Bob
- If Bob rejects, I can sell to John for a guaranteed $150

Since Bob values the product at $80, he won't pay more than that. And since I can get $150 from John, there's no reason for me to sell to Bob for less than $150.
