,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad you made a counteroffer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $140. It's a great product and I believe it's worth the investment. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I was thinking that $135 would be a more suitable price for the product.
