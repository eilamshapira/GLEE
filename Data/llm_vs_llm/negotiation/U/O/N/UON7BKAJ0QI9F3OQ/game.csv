"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but $60 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. How about we settle at $140? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm making a significant concession.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of your offer and my previous offer. How about we settle at $100? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I still need to get a bit closer to my target price. How about we settle at $120? It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm making another concession to try to reach a deal with you.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued concessions, but $120 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, considering we're getting close to the end of our negotiation. How about we settle at $90? It's a significant increase from my previous offers, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your latest offer, but $90 is still not enough for me to consider selling. We're running out of time, and I need to get a better price. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need you to meet me closer to my target price. How about we settle at $130? It's a fair price, and I'm not willing to go much lower than that.",130.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm surprised you went up to $130 after I made a significant increase in my previous offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to make a final compromise. How about we settle at $80? It's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the market value. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",80.0,Bob,8,
