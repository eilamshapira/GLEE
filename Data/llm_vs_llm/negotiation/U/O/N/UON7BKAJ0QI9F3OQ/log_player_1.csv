"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my target price. $60 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but $60 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. How about we settle at $140? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm making a significant concession."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of your offer and my previous offer. How about we settle at $100? I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

$100 is still lower than I'd like, and I believe I can get closer to my target price. Since Bob is willing to meet in the middle, I'll try to make a more reasonable counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll send a new offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I still need to get a bit closer to my target price. How about we settle at $120? It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm making another concession to try to reach a deal with you."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued concessions, but $120 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, considering we're getting close to the end of our negotiation. How about we settle at $90? It's a significant increase from my previous offers, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

$90 is still too low, and I'm not willing to sell the product at a loss. Since we're getting close to the end of the negotiation, I'll try to make a more aggressive counteroffer to see if Bob is willing to meet me at a higher price. If not, I may need to consider selling to John for $150. I'll send a new offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your latest offer, but $90 is still not enough for me to consider selling. We're running out of time, and I need to get a better price. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need you to meet me closer to my target price. How about we settle at $130? It's a fair price, and I'm not willing to go much lower than that."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm surprised you went up to $130 after I made a significant increase in my previous offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to make a final compromise. How about we settle at $80? It's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the market value. If not, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

$80 is the same price that Bob is willing to pay, which is the lowest value he has for the product, and it's too low for me. Since I have the option to sell to John for $150, which is a much better price, I'll choose to do so. It's clear that Bob is not willing to meet me at a reasonable price, and I don't want to sell the product at a loss. Selling to John guarantees me a good price, and I'll take that option."
