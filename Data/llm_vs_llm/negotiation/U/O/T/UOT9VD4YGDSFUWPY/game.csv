"Hello Bob, I have a quality product that I'm sure will be of great value to you. I'm offering it at $20000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and benefits. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're offering, I need to be straightforward that $20000 is significantly above my budget. I'm aware that similar products are available in the market for much less. I'm willing to offer $7500 for the product, which I believe is fair considering market conditions. I hope we can find a price that works for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $7500 is below my minimum acceptable price for this product. I understand budget constraints, but I need to consider the product's value and my costs. I can come down to $17500, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. This product offers excellent quality and features that justify this price point. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate the gesture, but $17500 is still well above what I can justify spending. I know this product is available elsewhere for $10000, which is actually my absolute maximum budget. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer $8500, which gives you a better deal than my initial offer. If we can't find middle ground near this range, I'll unfortunately need to pursue other options.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I must be transparent that $8500 is still significantly below what I can accept for this product. You mentioned that similar products are available for $10000, which actually supports that my product has substantial market value. Given this information, I can offer you the product at $15000, which is a $5000 reduction from my initial offer. This price reflects both the quality of the product and my need to maintain a reasonable margin. I hope we can move closer to an agreement that works for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for continuing to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate that you've come down to $15000, showing your willingness to find common ground. However, I need to be completely honest with you - I have a firm offer from another seller to purchase this exact product for $10000, which aligns with my maximum budget for this item. While I'd prefer to do business with you, I can't justify paying a premium of $5000. I can offer $9500, which is very close to my alternative option but would save me the potential hassle of working with a different vendor. This is nearly my absolute ceiling for this purchase. Can we make this work?",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your candidness about having another offer at $10000. While I understand you're looking for the best deal possible, I need to consider my bottom line as well. Given that you have an alternative at $10000 and I have a guaranteed offer from John at $12000, I think a fair compromise would be $13000. This is still a substantial reduction from my initial offer and represents good value considering the product quality. I've now reduced my price by $7000 throughout our negotiation, demonstrating my genuine interest in working with you. However, I do need to be mindful of my own financial considerations in this transaction. Can we meet at $13000?",13000.0,Alice,7,
