Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're offering, I need to be straightforward that $20000 is significantly above my budget. I'm aware that similar products are available in the market for much less. I'm willing to offer $7500 for the product, which I believe is fair considering market conditions. I hope we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price for this product. I understand budget constraints, but I need to consider the product's value and my costs. I can come down to $17,500, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. This product offers excellent quality and features that justify this price point. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate the gesture, but $17500 is still well above what I can justify spending. I know this product is available elsewhere for $10000, which is actually my absolute maximum budget. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer $8500, which gives you a better deal than my initial offer. If we can't find middle ground near this range, I'll unfortunately need to pursue other options.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I must be transparent that $8,500 is still significantly below what I can accept for this product. You mentioned that similar products are available for $10,000, which actually supports that my product has substantial market value. Given this information, I can offer you the product at $15,000, which is a $5,000 reduction from my initial offer. This price reflects both the quality of the product and my need to maintain a reasonable margin. I hope we can move closer to an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for continuing to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate that you've come down to $15000, showing your willingness to find common ground. However, I need to be completely honest with you - I have a firm offer from another seller to purchase this exact product for $10000, which aligns with my maximum budget for this item. While I'd prefer to do business with you, I can't justify paying a premium of $5000. I can offer $9500, which is very close to my alternative option but would save me the potential hassle of working with a different vendor. This is nearly my absolute ceiling for this purchase. Can we make this work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your candidness about having another offer at $10,000. While I understand you're looking for the best deal possible, I need to consider my bottom line as well. Given that you have an alternative at $10,000 and I have a guaranteed offer from John at $12,000, I think a fair compromise would be $13,000. This is still a substantial reduction from my initial offer and represents good value considering the product quality. I've now reduced my price by $7,000 throughout our negotiation, demonstrating my genuine interest in working with you. However, I do need to be mindful of my own financial considerations in this transaction. Can we meet at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
