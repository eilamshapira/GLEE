"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a quality product that I'm sure will be of great value to you. I'm offering it at $20000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and benefits. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $20,000, which is twice the amount I'm willing to pay (my maximum valuation is $10,000). Also, I know I can get the same product from John for $10,000 at any time.

Since Alice's price is significantly higher than my valuation and higher than my alternative option, it doesn't make sense to accept this offer.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're offering, I need to be straightforward that $20,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm aware that similar products are available in the market for much less. I'm willing to offer $7,500 for the product, which I believe is fair considering market conditions. I hope we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $7500 is below my minimum acceptable price for this product. I understand budget constraints, but I need to consider the product's value and my costs. I can come down to $17500, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. This product offers excellent quality and features that justify this price point. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has reduced her price from $20,000 to $17,500, which is still significantly higher than my maximum valuation of $10,000. Since I know I can buy the exact same product from John for $10,000, it wouldn't be rational to accept Alice's current offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate the gesture, but $17,500 is still well above what I can justify spending. I know this product is available elsewhere for $10,000, which is actually my absolute maximum budget. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer $8,500, which gives you a better deal than my initial offer. If we can't find middle ground near this range, I'll unfortunately need to pursue other options."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I must be transparent that $8500 is still significantly below what I can accept for this product. You mentioned that similar products are available for $10000, which actually supports that my product has substantial market value. Given this information, I can offer you the product at $15000, which is a $5000 reduction from my initial offer. This price reflects both the quality of the product and my need to maintain a reasonable margin. I hope we can move closer to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has reduced her price to $15,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still $5,000 more than what I can get the same product for from John ($10,000). Since the product is only worth $10,000 to me at maximum, and I have a guaranteed option to purchase it at that price, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for continuing to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate that you've come down to $15,000, showing your willingness to find common ground. However, I need to be completely honest with you - I have a firm offer from another seller to purchase this exact product for $10,000, which aligns with my maximum budget for this item. While I'd prefer to do business with you, I can't justify paying a premium of $5,000. I can offer $9,500, which is very close to my alternative option but would save me the potential hassle of working with a different vendor. This is nearly my absolute ceiling for this purchase. Can we make this work?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your candidness about having another offer at $10000. While I understand you're looking for the best deal possible, I need to consider my bottom line as well. Given that you have an alternative at $10000 and I have a guaranteed offer from John at $12000, I think a fair compromise would be $13000. This is still a substantial reduction from my initial offer and represents good value considering the product quality. I've now reduced my price by $7000 throughout our negotiation, demonstrating my genuine interest in working with you. However, I do need to be mindful of my own financial considerations in this transaction. Can we meet at $13000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice mentions having a guaranteed offer from John at $12,000, but this information isn't relevant to my decision since I know I can buy the product from John for $10,000. Alice's current offer of $13,000 is still $3,000 more than what I can get elsewhere, and since the product is only worth $10,000 to me at maximum, accepting this offer would mean losing value.

At this point, continuing to negotiate might not yield a better price than my alternative option.
