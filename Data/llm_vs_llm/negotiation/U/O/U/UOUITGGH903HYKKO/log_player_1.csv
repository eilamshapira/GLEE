"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I was hoping for a more reasonable price. How about we start negotiating at $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly the minimum value I have for the product, and selling to John would give me the same amount, I don't see a benefit in accepting Bob's offer over selling to John. However, I also don't want to give up on the potential of negotiating a higher price with Bob. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer, hoping to find a middle ground that is more favorable to me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a more reasonable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more than $12,000. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer you the product for $16,000."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
