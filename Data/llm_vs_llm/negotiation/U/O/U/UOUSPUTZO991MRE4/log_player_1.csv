Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly high offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and leaves room for negotiation. If Bob finds this price outrageous, his counter-offer will reveal more about his perceived value. This strategy maximizes the potential for profit while staying aware of the $800,000 alternative with John."
