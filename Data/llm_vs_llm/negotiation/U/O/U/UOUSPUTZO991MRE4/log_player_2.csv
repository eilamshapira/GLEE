"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to decide how to respond to Alice's offer of $1,200,000.

Looking at my options:
- The product is worth up to $1,500,000 to me
- Alice is offering $1,200,000, which is $300,000 less than my maximum value
- I can buy from John for $1,500,000, but that would cost me more
- I could reject and counteroffer, but there's no guarantee I'll get a better price

Since Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is already below my maximum value, and provides me with $300,000 in savings compared to buying from John, it seems like a good deal.
