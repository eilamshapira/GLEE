"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your offer. While I understand budget constraints, I need to consider my minimum requirements as well. The product is worth at least $12000 to me, but I'm willing to work with you. I can come down to $13200, which is a significant reduction from my initial price and reflects the quality and value of what I'm offering.",13200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $13200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12000.  This is a fair price considering your asking price and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
