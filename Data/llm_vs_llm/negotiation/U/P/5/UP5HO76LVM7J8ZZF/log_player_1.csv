Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to choose a price for my product that maximizes my profit while considering that Bob may reject offers that are too high.

If I price too low (near $150), I won't make much profit compared to my fallback option of selling to John.

If I price too high, Bob may reject the offer and I'll end up with $150 from John.

Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I need to strike a balance. A reasonable approach is to set a price significantly higher than my minimum ($150) but not so high that Bob is likely to reject it outright.
