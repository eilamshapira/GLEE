Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations if you have a different valuation in mind."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but considering my alternatives, I'm prepared to offer $9000. Let me know if you can work with that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $9,000 is higher than John's offer of $8,000, it's worth continuing the negotiation to try to get a better price. However, I believe the product is worth more than $9,000, so I'll make a counteroffer to try to get closer to my target price. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a reasonable offer, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000, considering the product's value and my other options. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
