Hi Bob! I have a fantastic product available for you. I'm offering it at a special price just for you.,150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can we meet at that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. Unfortunately, $80 is a bit too low for the value this product offers. How about we settle at $130? I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $80 might be too low, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105. This way, we can both get a fair deal. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,4,
