"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $25000. What do you say?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering my needs.",10000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, I believe the product's value exceeds $10000. I'm willing to come down to $20000, considering your budget constraints. Let me know what you think.",20000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but I'm confident that the value this product brings justifies a higher investment. How about we settle at $18000? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price. However, $18000 is still above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'll pay $14000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I believe the product's value is still higher than $14000. Let's meet in the middle between your offer and mine. How about $16000? This should be a fair price for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer to an agreement. To further show my willingness to work with your budget, I'm willing to lower the price to $15000. This is a significant step down from my previous offers, and I believe it reflects a fair value for the product. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,5,
