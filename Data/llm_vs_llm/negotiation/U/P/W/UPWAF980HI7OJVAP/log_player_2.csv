Alice's opening offer is the maximum I'm willing to pay. There's no benefit to accepting it now. I should counter with a lower price and see if she's willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 800000}

Let's start with a significantly lower offer to see how Alice responds. This gives us plenty of room to negotiate upwards if needed."

Alice moving down $200,000 indicates a willingness to negotiate. I believe there's still room to bring the price down further."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to move, but I'm still aiming for a price well below her current offer."

While Alice is coming down in price, I think there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to push a bit further, especially with several rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 875000}

I'm splitting the difference between our last two offers.  This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a firm target price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice continues to move towards a more agreeable price, but we are getting close to the point where I may need to concede more ground to avoid the risk of going over budget with John. I'll hold firm for another round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 890000}

I'm increasing my offer slightly again to show good faith but remaining firm below $900,000 for now. This leaves some room for negotiation while keeping a reasonable margin from John's price."
