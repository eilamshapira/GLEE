"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. I'd like to sell it to you for $9000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer or not. 

Alice is offering me the product for $9,000. The product is worth up to $10,000 to me, so this offer would save me $1,000 compared to my maximum valuation.

If I reject Alice's offer, my only other option is to buy from John for $10,000.

Since Alice's offer ($9,000) is less than John's price ($10,000), and less than my maximum valuation ($10,000), I should accept Alice's offer.
