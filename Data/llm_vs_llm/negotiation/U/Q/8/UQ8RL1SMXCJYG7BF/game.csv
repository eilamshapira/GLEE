"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1200000 is significantly above my budget. I have another seller offering the same product for $1000000, but I'm willing to work with you if we can reach a more reasonable price. Would you consider $800000? This would be a fair price that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is too low for this product's value. You mentioned another seller offering it at $1000000, which actually demonstrates the fair market value. Given our potential for a long-term business relationship, I can offer you a better price than that competitor - $1050000. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents excellent value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
