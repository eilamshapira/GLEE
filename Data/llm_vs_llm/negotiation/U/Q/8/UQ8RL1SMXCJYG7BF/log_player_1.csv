"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be very valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,200,000. This is a competitive price for the value you'll receive."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1200000 is significantly above my budget. I have another seller offering the same product for $1000000, but I'm willing to work with you if we can reach a more reasonable price. Would you consider $800000? This would be a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's mention of another seller at $1,000,000 suggests there's room for negotiation above $800,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is too low for this product's value. You mentioned another seller offering it at $1,000,000, which actually demonstrates the fair market value. Given our potential for a long-term business relationship, I can offer you a better price than that competitor - $1,050,000. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents excellent value."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
