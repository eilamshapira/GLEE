"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be very valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1200000. This is a competitive price for the value you'll receive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000), I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. There's no reason to accept a price that's higher than my alternative option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I have another seller offering the same product for $1,000,000, but I'm willing to work with you if we can reach a more reasonable price. Would you consider $800,000? This would be a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is too low for this product's value. You mentioned another seller offering it at $1000000, which actually demonstrates the fair market value. Given our potential for a long-term business relationship, I can offer you a better price than that competitor - $1050000. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents excellent value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John for $1,000,000. Here's why:
1. Alice's new offer ($1,050,000) is still above John's price ($1,000,000)
2. Alice seems to be anchoring her price based on John's price, suggesting she might not go significantly lower
3. While we could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice will go below $1,000,000
4. We've already used 3 rounds, and time is valuable
5. John's price is within my maximum value ($1,000,000)

It's more practical to take John's guaranteed offer rather than continue negotiations that might not lead to a better price."
