"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $1500000. This is a firm offer that reflects its true value, and I believe you'll find it a great opportunity. Please let me know if you accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's initial offer is at the maximum value I'm willing to pay ($1,500,000), and I have the option to buy the same product from John for the same price, I don't see a need to accept Alice's offer immediately without trying to negotiate a better price. However, given that Alice's offer is already at my maximum budget and there's no indication that she's willing to go lower, the most strategic move would be to try and negotiate. But, considering the constraints and the fact that I can get the product for the same price from John, the best decision might be to directly buy from John to avoid any potential hassle or time spent in negotiations that may not yield a better result.
