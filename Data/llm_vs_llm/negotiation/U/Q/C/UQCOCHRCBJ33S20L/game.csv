"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $2100000. This is a competitive price for a product of this caliber.",2100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000, which I believe is more in line with my budget and the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, I cannot accept $1200000 as it's significantly below my target price. I can reduce my initial offer and propose $1800000 for the product. This price better reflects its true value while still providing room for negotiation.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the reduction in price, but I still think $1800000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1400000, which I believe is a fair compromise between our two positions.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
