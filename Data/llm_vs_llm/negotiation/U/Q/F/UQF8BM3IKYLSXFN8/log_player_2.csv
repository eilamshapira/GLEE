"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a unique opportunity for you to purchase an exclusive product that is highly valuable. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Alice is offering the product at your maximum budget.  There's no incentive to accept her offer since you can buy the same product from John for the same price. By rejecting, you might get Alice to lower her price or find another seller who might be offering a better deal."
