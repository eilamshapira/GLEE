"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product, I'll start by making a relatively high offer. This will give me room to negotiate and potentially settle on a higher price.

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $4,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value of $12,000 that I'm willing to accept, I will reject his offer.

Additionally, selling to John for $12,000 is a safer option, but I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can get a better price from him.

So, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $4,000, which is quite low, I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my initial offer of $20,000. However, I'll also consider the fact that I have a safety net of $12,000 from John, so I won't go too low.

My counteroffer will be:

{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's new offer of $6,000 is still lower than the minimum value of $12,000 that I'm willing to accept. While it's an improvement from his previous offer of $4,000, it's still not enough.

At this point, I have to consider the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob versus selling to John for $12,000. Since Bob's offer is still quite low, I'm inclined to reject it and try to get a better price from him.

However, I'll also try to be more realistic in my expectations, so my next counteroffer will be lower than my previous one.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

(I'll make a counteroffer in the next round)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $6,000, I'll try to find a middle ground that's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than my previous one of $15,000, but still higher than Bob's offer.

My counteroffer will be:

{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's new offer of $8,000 is still lower than the minimum value of $12,000 that I'm willing to accept. However, it's getting closer, and I can see that he's willing to negotiate.

At this point, I have to weigh the pros and cons of continuing to negotiate with Bob versus selling to John for $12,000. Since Bob's offer is still $4,000 lower than my minimum acceptable price, I'm inclined to reject it.

But, I'll also consider the fact that I've already invested 5 rounds in this negotiation, and I might be able to get a better price from Bob if I continue.

Given that Bob's offer is $8,000, and John's offer is $12,000, I think it's time to stop negotiating and take the safer option.
