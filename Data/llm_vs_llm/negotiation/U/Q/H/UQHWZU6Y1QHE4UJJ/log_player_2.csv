(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","The initial offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than my maximum valuation of $10,000. Therefore, accepting the offer is not an option. Since there are 10 rounds of negotiation, it's too early to buy from John. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.
