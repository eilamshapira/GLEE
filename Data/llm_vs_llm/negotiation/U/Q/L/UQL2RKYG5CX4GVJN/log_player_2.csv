"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my premium product to you for $1800000. This product is highly valuable, and I believe it would be a great asset for you. Please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer ($1,800,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000), the best decision is to buy from John. Even if I were to make a counteroffer to Alice, there's no guarantee she would lower the price below $1,000,000, and negotiating would just waste time when I have a guaranteed option at my maximum acceptable price."
