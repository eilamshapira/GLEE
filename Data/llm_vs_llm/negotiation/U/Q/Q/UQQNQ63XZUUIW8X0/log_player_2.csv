"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. I know you recognize its value at $1500000, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1600000.  Given its potential, I believe this is a reasonable price, and it allows me to prioritize you as a valued customer. If I don't hear back from you within 24 hours, I'll be moving forward with another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Looking at Alice's offer, she's asking for $1,600,000 for the product. However, the product is only worth $1,500,000 to me, and I can buy it from John for exactly $1,500,000.

Alice's offer is $100,000 more than both the product's worth to me and John's offering price. It wouldn't make financial sense to accept Alice's offer when I have a better alternative.
