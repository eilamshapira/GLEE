"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that I believe will greatly benefit your operations. Based on its potential value to you, I'm setting the price at $1200000. This price reflects a significant advantage for you while ensuring a fair return for me. I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell since the product is only worth $800,000 to her. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get her to come down closer to her desired profit margin."
