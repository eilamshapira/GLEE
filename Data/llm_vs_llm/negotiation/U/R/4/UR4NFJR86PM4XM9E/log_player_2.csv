"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $9500. I believe itâ€™s a great deal for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $9,500, which is well above my maximum value
3. John is offering the product for $8,000, which equals my maximum value
4. Even if I make a counteroffer, Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000 since the product is worth $10,000 to her

Since Alice's current offer ($9,500) is significantly above my maximum value ($8,000), and John's fixed offer ($8,000) matches my maximum value, the best decision would be to buy from John. There's no point in continuing negotiations with Alice as she's starting too high and is unlikely to match or beat John's price.
