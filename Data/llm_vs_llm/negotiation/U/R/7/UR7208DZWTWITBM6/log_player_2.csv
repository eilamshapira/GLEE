"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's alternative price ($800,000). It would be irrational to accept this offer as it would result in a loss. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round, knowing I always have the option to buy from John at $800,000 if negotiations with Alice don't improve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

I'll offer $700,000 to Alice. Here's my reasoning:
1. The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, so anything below that is a loss for her
2. I have a strong BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement) of $800,000 from John
3. Starting with $700,000 gives room for negotiation while still being potentially profitable for both parties
4. If Alice rejects this, we can negotiate upward, but staying below my maximum of $800,000
5. This price point signals that Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 was far too high"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll continue to reject this offer because:
1. $1,050,000 is still significantly above my maximum value of $800,000
2. I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $800,000
3. The reduction from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000 shows Alice is willing to negotiate downward
4. There's no reason to accept a price that would result in a loss when I have a better alternative
5. I can either make another counteroffer or switch to John if Alice doesn't come down to a reasonable price"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 750000}

I'm increasing my offer to $750,000. Here's my reasoning:
1. This shows good faith negotiation by moving up from my previous offer of $700,000
2. It's still below my maximum value of $800,000 and John's price
3. While it's below Alice's cost ($1,000,000), it might be better for her than no deal at all
4. The incremental increase shows I'm willing to be reasonable but also signals that I won't go much higher
5. If Alice rejects this, I can either make one final offer closer to $800,000 or simply go with John's offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'm choosing to buy from John because:
1. Alice's offers remain significantly above my maximum value ($800,000)
2. While Alice has shown some movement (from $1,200,000 to $1,025,000), she's still far from a price that would work for me
3. John's price of $800,000 is exactly at my maximum value
4. Further negotiation with Alice seems unlikely to result in a better deal than John's offer
5. Alice seems unwilling to go below her cost ($1,000,000), which makes sense from her perspective, but means we won't reach a mutually beneficial agreement
6. It's time to exercise my BATNA and take the guaranteed option from John"
