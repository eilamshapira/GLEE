Round 2

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18000 is significantly above market value for this product. I know of similar products selling for much less. I'm willing to offer $13500, which I believe is a fair price that would work well for both of us.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
