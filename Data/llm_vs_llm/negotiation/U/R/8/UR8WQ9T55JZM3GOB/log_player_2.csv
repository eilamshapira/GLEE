"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I believe this product is of great value and would be a perfect fit for your needs. I'm offering it to you for $18000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze the situation:
1. Alice is offering the product for $18,000
2. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me
3. John is willing to sell it for $15,000
4. Alice's asking price is above both my maximum value and John's price

Since Alice's offer ($18,000) is higher than both my maximum value ($15,000) and John's price ($15,000), I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. There's potential to negotiate with Alice for a better price, knowing that the product is worth $12,000 to her.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's above Alice's cost ($12,000) but well below her initial asking price ($18,000) and John's price ($15,000).

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18,000 is significantly above market value for this product. I know of similar products selling for much less. I'm willing to offer $13,500, which I believe is a fair price that would work well for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about market prices. However, given the unique qualities and benefits of this product, I'm willing to offer it to you for $16500. This way, you are getting a high-quality product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze this new situation:

1. Alice has reduced her price from $18,000 to $16,500
2. This is still above John's price of $15,000
3. John's offer is still the better option at this point
4. We could continue negotiating, but Alice's high counter suggests she might not come down below John's price

Since Alice's new price ($16,500) is still above John's price ($15,000), and there's no guarantee Alice will go lower than John's price, the rational decision is to buy from John. This ensures I get the product at a known good price without further negotiation risk.
