"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a high offer to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit.

{""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $12,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still better than John's $10,000. However, since this is only round 2 and we have more rounds to negotiate, I believe I can get a better price from Bob. The product is worth $15,000 to him, so there's room for a higher price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from the initial offer but still aim for a good profit, trying to meet somewhere in the middle between Bob's $12,000 and my initial $14,500.

{""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob has increased his offer by $500, showing he's willing to negotiate upward. While $12,500 is better than John's $10,000, we're still in the early rounds (round 4 of 10), and there's potential to get a better price. Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's still room for negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll reduce my previous offer to show willingness to compromise, but still maintain a good profit margin. I'll split the difference between my last offer ($13,500) and Bob's last offer ($12,500).

{""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob has increased his offer again, but only by $250 this time. We're now in round 6 of 10, so we need to be more careful. While there's still room for negotiation, the smaller increments in Bob's offers suggest he might not go much higher. The current offer of $12,750 is significantly better than John's $10,000, and the risk of losing value in continued negotiation is increasing.
