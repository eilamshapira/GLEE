"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than my maximum budget of $1,200,000, I am willing to consider it. However, I also believe that Alice's minimum price of $1,000,000 gives me some room to negotiate. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Considering Alice's minimum price is $1,000,000, I'll offer a price that is slightly higher than that, hoping to find a mutually acceptable price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,080,000 is a compromise, and it's getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with. However, I still think I can get a better deal. Since Alice rejected my previous counteroffer, I'll try to meet her halfway between her new offer and my previous counteroffer.

But before making another counteroffer, I'll consider accepting her current offer. $1,080,000 is a good price, and it's only $80,000 more than my ideal price. Considering the hassle of further negotiation, I might just accept this offer.
