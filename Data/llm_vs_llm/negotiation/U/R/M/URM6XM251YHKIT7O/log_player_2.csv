"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm sure you'll find our asking price of $1490000 quite reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,490,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,490,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,490,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept this offer. Given that John's price is exactly at my maximum value and is $490,000 less than Alice's current offer, the best decision would be to buy from John.
