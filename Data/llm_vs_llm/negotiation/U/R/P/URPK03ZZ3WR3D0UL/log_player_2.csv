"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Looking at the options:

(1) Accept Alice's offer for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy from John for $1,200,000

Since Alice's offer is exactly the same price as John's offer ($1,200,000), and this is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product, there's no financial advantage to choosing one over the other. I might as well accept Alice's offer.
