"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to sell it to you for a competitive price. I'd like to start the negotiation at $12000, which I think is a fair price considering its worth.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $7000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to get a bit more for it. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I'd like to propose a price of $11000. This is a more reasonable price considering the product's value, and I'm hoping we can meet at this point.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $11000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7500. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. Let me know if this works for you.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $7500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still need to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to come down further, and I'd like to propose a price of $10000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I hope we can agree on this price.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10000 is still too high for me. I can go up to $8000, which is my absolute maximum. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,6,
