Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $7,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. My next offer will be $11,000."

This is a more reasonable price considering the product's value, and I'm hoping we can meet at this point."", ""product_price"": 11000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $11000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7500. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500.

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob. Since he's willing to increase his offer to $7,500, I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my previous counteroffer. My next offer will be $10,000. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $7,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still need to get a bit more for the product.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10000 is still too high for me. I can go up to $8000, which is my absolute maximum. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options. Let me know what you think.

Since Bob's maximum offer is $8,000, which is below my minimum acceptable price, and I have the option to sell the product to John for $12,000, I think it's best to accept John's offer. This ensures I get a price that meets my minimum requirement, and I don't have to continue negotiating with Bob."
