Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $800,000 to Bob
2. I won't accept less than $800,000 (as I can sell to John for this amount)
3. Bob will likely reject if the price is too high above his valuation
4. Since Bob knows I have another buyer (John), he knows I have a strong alternative

Given these factors, I'll offer the product at a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation to give him a small incentive to accept, while still maximizing my profit.
