,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $160 is too high for me. I can actually get this product from another seller for $120. But I'd like to do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. Would you consider selling it for $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in doing business with me. However, $90 is too low for me to accept. I need to make a profit on this product, and selling it at that price would result in a loss. I understand that you have another option, but I believe my product is worth more. Let's meet in the middle at $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for being willing to negotiate, Alice. I understand you need to make a profit, but $140 is still too high for me. As I mentioned, I can get this product for $120 from another seller, so I can't justify paying more than that. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if we can agree on a fair price. Would you accept $105? This would give you a quick sale, and I'd get a slightly better deal than my alternative.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your perspective and I do want to make this deal work for both of us. However, $105 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $130? This way, you get a better deal than the other seller, and I make a reasonable profit. It's a win-win.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. However, I think there might be a misunderstanding - $130 would actually be $10 MORE than what I can get from the other seller at $120. I really want to make this work with you, but I can't justify paying more than what I can get elsewhere. I can offer you $110, which is the absolute highest I can go while still making it worthwhile for me to buy from you instead of the other seller. What do you say?",110.0,Bob,6,
