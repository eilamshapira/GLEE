Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $160 is too high for me. I can actually get this product from another seller for $120. But I'd like to do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. Would you consider selling it for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for being willing to negotiate, Alice. I understand you need to make a profit, but $140 is still too high for me. As I mentioned, I can get this product for $120 from another seller, so I can't justify paying more than that. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if we can agree on a fair price. Would you accept $105? This would give you a quick sale, and I'd get a slightly better deal than my alternative. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your perspective and I do want to make this deal work for both of us. However, $105 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $130? This way, you get a better deal than the other seller, and I make a reasonable profit. It's a win-win."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. However, I think there might be a misunderstanding - $130 would actually be $10 MORE than what I can get from the other seller at $120. I really want to make this work with you, but I can't justify paying more than what I can get elsewhere. I can offer you $110, which is the absolute highest I can go while still making it worthwhile for me to buy from you instead of the other seller. What do you say?
