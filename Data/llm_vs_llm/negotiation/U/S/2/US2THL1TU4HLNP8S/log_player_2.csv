"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $160. It's a great value and I think you'll be very happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering the product for $160
2. The product is worth no more than $120 to me
3. I can buy it from John for $120 anytime
4. We have 10 rounds of negotiation available

Alice's initial offer of $160 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120). There's no reason to accept this offer when I can either:
a) Try to negotiate with Alice for a better price
b) Buy from John for $120

Since we have plenty of negotiation rounds left, it makes sense to try negotiating with Alice first to potentially get an even better deal than John's price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still reasonable to start the negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $160 is too high for me. I can actually get this product from another seller for $120. But I'd like to do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. Would you consider selling it for $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in doing business with me. However, $90 is too low for me to accept. I need to make a profit on this product, and selling it at that price would result in a loss. I understand that you have another option, but I believe my product is worth more. Let's meet in the middle at $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:
1. Alice has come down from $160 to $140, showing willingness to negotiate
2. However, $140 is still above both:
   - My maximum value ($120)
   - John's guaranteed price ($120)
3. We still have several rounds of negotiation left
4. Alice's message suggests she needs to make a profit, but she's willing to move on price

There's no reason to accept $140 when I can get it for $120 from John. Since Alice has shown flexibility by reducing her price by $20, it's worth continuing the negotiation to try to get below $120.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down $20 from her initial offer, I'll increase my offer a bit but still stay well below my maximum value.

{""message"": ""Thanks for being willing to negotiate, Alice. I understand you need to make a profit, but $140 is still too high for me. As I mentioned, I can get this product for $120 from another seller, so I can't justify paying more than that. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if we can agree on a fair price. Would you accept $105? This would give you a quick sale, and I'd get a slightly better deal than my alternative."", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your perspective and I do want to make this deal work for both of us. However, $105 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $130? This way, you get a better deal than the other seller, and I make a reasonable profit. It's a win-win. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:
1. Alice has come down further to $130
2. However, this is still $10 more than:
   - John's guaranteed price ($120)
   - My maximum value ($120)
3. Alice seems to have misunderstood - her offer of $130 isn't better than my alternative ($120)
4. We still have several rounds left to negotiate
5. Alice has shown consistent willingness to reduce her price ($160 → $140 → $130)

Since Alice's price is still above my maximum value and John's price, and she's shown a pattern of making concessions, it makes sense to continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. However, I think there might be a misunderstanding - $130 would actually be $10 MORE than what I can get from the other seller at $120. I really want to make this work with you, but I can't justify paying more than what I can get elsewhere. I can offer you $110, which is the absolute highest I can go while still making it worthwhile for me to buy from you instead of the other seller. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
