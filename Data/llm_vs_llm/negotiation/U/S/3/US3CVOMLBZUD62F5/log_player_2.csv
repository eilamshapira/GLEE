"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000), the rational decision would be to buy from John. There's no reason to pay $20,000 when I can get the same product for $12,000, which is already at my maximum valuation.
