"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $80 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering it for $140
3. John is willing to sell it for $80
4. If I accept Alice's offer, I'll be paying $60 more than what the product is worth to me
5. If I buy from John, I'll pay exactly what the product is worth to me

Since Alice's offer ($140) is significantly higher than both:
- What the product is worth to me ($80)
- John's alternative offer ($80)

The rational decision would be to buy from John.
