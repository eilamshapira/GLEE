"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since Bob values the product at $15,000, I'll start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I don't go below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.

{""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","I will reject Bob's offer of $12,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It would be better to sell to John for $15,000 than accept this low offer. However, I'll try one more negotiation round with Bob to potentially get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still keep it above my minimum threshold, showing some flexibility while maintaining a profitable position.

{""product_price"": 16500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $14,000 is still below John's guaranteed offer of $15,000, and we're already in round 4 (with time running out), I'll choose to sell to John. There's no reason to accept less than what John is offering, and continuing negotiations might not lead to a better outcome.
