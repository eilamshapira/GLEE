,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm looking to spend no more than $80. Can we compromise at $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is higher than your initial expectation. However, my bottom line is $80. How about we meet in the middle at $95?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit high for me. I can offer $70. How about that?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer! I really can't go below $80 for this product, so how about $85? That's a significant drop from my initial price and I think it's a very fair offer considering the value.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, we're indeed getting closer. But since you mentioned that you can't go below $80, how about we settle at $80? That way, it's a win-win for both of us.",80.0,Bob,6,
