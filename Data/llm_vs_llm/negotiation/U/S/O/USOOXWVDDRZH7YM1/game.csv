"Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be extremely valuable for you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2300000. This price reflects the product's true worth and potential value. Would you be interested in making this purchase?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2300000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, which is still a considerable amount.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $1000000 is too low for this product's value. I understand you have budget constraints, but I know the product is worth significantly more. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1900000. This is a substantial reduction that better reflects current market conditions while maintaining the product's premium value. Would this work better for you?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1900000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1500000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
