Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $1000000 is too low for this product's value. I understand you have budget constraints, but I know the product is worth significantly more. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1900000. This is a substantial reduction that better reflects current market conditions while maintaining the product's premium value. Would this work better for you?

While Alice has reduced her price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You should reject her offer and make a counteroffer."
