Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. Since I know my minimum acceptable price is $12,000 (as I can sell to John for this amount), and I don't know Bob's maximum willingness to pay, I should set a price significantly higher than $12,000 to maximize my potential profit. If Bob rejects, I still have John's offer as a backup.

I'll set a price that's notably higher than my minimum while still being potentially reasonable for a valuable product.
