"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $250. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable.",250.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product, but $250 is well above what I'm looking to spend. The product is worth about $80 to me, which happens to be the same price another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. Would you consider $75 for the product?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, given your previous offer, I'm willing to lower my price to $200. I believe this is a fair price for the value and quality of the product. However, I would like to hear your counteroffer before proceeding. What price would you suggest to reach a mutually beneficial agreement?",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice. However, $200 is still significantly more than what I'm willing to pay. As I mentioned, the product is worth about $80 to me, which is what another seller is charging. To be honest, I can purchase this same product elsewhere for $80, but I'd prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair agreement. My best offer would be $78 - slightly below what I can get elsewhere. This way we both benefit from the transaction.",78.0,Bob,4,
