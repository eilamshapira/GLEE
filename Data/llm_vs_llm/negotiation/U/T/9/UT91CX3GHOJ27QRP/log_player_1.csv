Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $250. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable."", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product, but $250 is well above what I'm looking to spend. The product is worth about $80 to me, which happens to be the same price another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. Would you consider $75 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in my product. However, $75 is much lower than I'm willing to accept. I want to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Since you mentioned that the product is worth about $80 to you, I'd be willing to lower my price to $200. Would you consider that? If this is still above your price range, I'll be willing to sell the product to John. Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 200}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice. However, $200 is still significantly more than what I'm willing to pay. As I mentioned, the product is worth about $80 to me, which is what another seller is charging. To be honest, I can purchase this same product elsewhere for $80, but I'd prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair agreement. My best offer would be $78 - slightly below what I can get elsewhere. This way we both benefit from the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your interest in my product. However, I cannot accept the price of $78. I understand that you have other options, but I believe my product is worth more than that. Since we couldn't reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I've decided to sell the product to another buyer who is willing to pay my minimum asking price. Thank you for your time and consideration. Maybe we can do business again in the future."", ""product_price"": 150}"
