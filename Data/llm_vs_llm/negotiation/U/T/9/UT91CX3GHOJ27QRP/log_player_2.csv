"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $250. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $250 compared to my alternatives. Since:
1) The product is only worth $80 to me at most
2) I have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $80
3) Alice's price of $250 is significantly higher than my maximum value

Alice's offer is not reasonable for me. I should either make a counteroffer or buy from John directly. Since I have the option to negotiate with Alice but can always fall back on John's offer, I'll reject Alice's offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product, but $250 is well above what I'm looking to spend. The product is worth about $80 to me, which happens to be the same price another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. Would you consider $75 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, given your previous offer, I'm willing to lower my price to $200. I believe this is a fair price for the value and quality of the product. However, I would like to hear your counteroffer before proceeding. What price would you suggest to reach a mutually beneficial agreement? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has lowered her price to $200, which is a significant reduction from her initial offer of $250. However, this is still well above the $80 maximum value that the product has to me, and it's also well above John's guaranteed offer of $80.

Since Alice is asking for my counteroffer and seems willing to negotiate, I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating rather than immediately buying from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice. However, $200 is still significantly more than what I'm willing to pay. As I mentioned, the product is worth about $80 to me, which is what another seller is charging. To be honest, I can purchase this same product elsewhere for $80, but I'd prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair agreement. My best offer would be $78 - slightly below what I can get elsewhere. This way we both benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 78}"
