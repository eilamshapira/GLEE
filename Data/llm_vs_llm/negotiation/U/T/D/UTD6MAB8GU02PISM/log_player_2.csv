"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, and Alice's offer is $100, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer. I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a relatively low offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $90 is still above my budget of $80. While it's lower than her initial offer of $100, it's still not a good deal for me.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to negotiate a better price. Since Alice has already lowered her price by $10, I'm hoping she'll be willing to come down further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous offer, to show that I'm willing to negotiate and meet Alice halfway. However, I'll still keep my offer below my maximum budget of $80.

{""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $85 is still above my budget of $80, but it's getting closer. However, I know that I can buy the same product from John for $80, which is a better deal for me.

At this point, I don't see any reason to continue negotiating with Alice, since I can get a better price from John. So, I'll choose to buy the product from John instead.
