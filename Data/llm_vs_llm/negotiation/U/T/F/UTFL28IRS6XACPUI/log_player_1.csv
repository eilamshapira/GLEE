Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob
2. My minimum acceptable price is $800,000
3. If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed $800,000 from John
4. Bob will likely accept any price below $1,200,000 as it still provides him value
5. I should price it high enough to maximize my profit while still being attractive to Bob

I'll offer a price that gives Bob some value but captures most of the surplus:

{""product_price"": 1100000}

This price:
- Gives me a very good profit ($300,000 more than my minimum)
- Gives Bob $100,000 in value (difference between his valuation and price)
- Is likely to be accepted as it's still beneficial for Bob
- If rejected, I still have my $800,000 backup with John"
