"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than my maximum budget of $1,200,000 and I want to save as much money as possible, I will consider this a reasonable offer. However, I also need to consider that rejecting the offer would lead to buying from John at $1,200,000, which is my maximum limit.

Given that Alice's offer is $100,000 less than what I'm willing to pay (and presumably less than what John is offering), it seems like a good deal. Additionally, since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, there might be room for further negotiation, but without knowing more about Alice's flexibility on the price, I'll have to make a decision based on the current offer.

Therefore, my decision is to accept Alice's offer because it saves me $100,000 compared to buying from John, and it's a significant amount of money.
