"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since the product is worth $10,000 to me and Alice's offer of $9,500 is lower than that, it's a good deal. However, I want to try to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is $1,500 more than what the product is worth to her, so there might be some room for negotiation.

I'll choose option (2) and reject Alice's offer to see if I can get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since Alice's offer was $9,500 and the product is worth $8,000 to her, I'll try to split the difference.

My counteroffer will be $8,500.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice rejected my counteroffer and came back with a new offer of $9,200, which is $300 lower than her initial offer. This suggests that she's willing to negotiate and flexible with her price.

However, I still think I can get a better deal. The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so she's still making a significant profit with her current offer. I'll try to reject her offer again and make another counteroffer to see if I can get her to lower the price further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's latest offer was $9,200, I'll try to make a counteroffer that is lower than that, but still closer to her previous offer than my initial counteroffer.

My counteroffer will be $8,800.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice rejected my counteroffer again and came back with a new offer of $9,100, which is $100 lower than her previous offer. This suggests that she's still willing to negotiate, but the price reductions are getting smaller.

At this point, I'm getting closer to my maximum budget of $10,000, and I'm starting to think that I might not be able to get a significantly better deal. However, I'll try to reject her offer one more time and make another counteroffer to see if I can get her to lower the price further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's latest offer was $9,100, I'll try to make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one, to show that I'm willing to compromise.

My counteroffer will be $9,000.
