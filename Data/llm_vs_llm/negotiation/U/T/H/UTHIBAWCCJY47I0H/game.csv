"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the premium product. I'm interested in the product, but the price of $12000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000, considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand you're looking for a better price, $9000 is too close to my minimum threshold. This product has exceptional features and durability that justify a higher price point. I can come down to $11000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's quality and value. Would this work for you?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming back with a revised price of $11000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get the best value possible. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000, which is the highest I'm comfortable paying for the product. If we can't agree on this price, I may need to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
