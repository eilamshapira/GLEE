Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its exceptional value and market demand, I'm offering it at $17,500. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and quality."", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the information about the product's value. However, that price is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

The reason for my decision is that Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Additionally, since Bob's initial counteroffer is so low (even below his own value of $8,000), it suggests he's not likely to reach a price point that would be acceptable to me. Given that I have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay $15,000, which meets my minimum acceptable price, it's most profitable to sell to John rather than continue negotiations with Bob."
