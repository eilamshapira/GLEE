Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my strategy here. I'm selling a product worth at least $150 to me. If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell it to John for a guaranteed $150.

I don't know how much Bob values the product, so there's some risk in pricing too high (he might reject) or too low (I'd leave money on the table). Since I have the fallback option with John, I can afford to be somewhat ambitious with my pricing to Bob.
