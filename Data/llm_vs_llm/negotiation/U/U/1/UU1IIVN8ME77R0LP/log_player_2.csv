"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Looking at the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: Pay $120
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John: Pay $120

Both Alice and John are offering the product at exactly $120, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Since I would pay the same amount either way, and the product is worth $120 to me, I should accept one of the offers.
