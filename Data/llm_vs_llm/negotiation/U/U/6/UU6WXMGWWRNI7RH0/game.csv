"Good day Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe will greatly benefit you. I'm offering it to you for $3000000. I'm open to discussing the price, but I believe this offer is quite competitive given the product's value. What do you think?",3000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $3000000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1800000 for it.  I'm confident this is a fair price, given my budget and the product's potential value to me.  What do you think?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that we're trying to find a middle ground here. Given your budget and the value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $2500000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I believe it's a fair price for both parties. What do you think?",2500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $2500000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $2200000.  This is a substantial amount for me, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we both see in the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",2200000.0,Bob,4,
