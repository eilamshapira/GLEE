"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $150
2. Alice's offer is $120, which is below my maximum value
3. John's fixed price is $150
4. If I reject, I can make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price
5. However, there's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower price

Given that $120 is already a good price (20% below my maximum value), and there's a risk that negotiations might break down or lead to a higher price, I'll accept Alice's offer.
