"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14000 is a bit above my budget. Considering the market and my budget constraints, I'm willing to offer $11000 for the product. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $11000. I appreciate your interest in the product and understand that we're not far apart in terms of price. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13500, considering the product's unique features and value. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, and I believe this price reflects a fair compromise.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. While $13500 is closer to what I can consider, my budget allows me to stretch only up to $12000. If you can accommodate this, I'm ready to proceed with the purchase immediately.",12000.0,Bob,4,
