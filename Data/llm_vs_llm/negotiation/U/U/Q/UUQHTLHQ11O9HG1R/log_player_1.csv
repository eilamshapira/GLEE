Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its value."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14000 is a bit above my budget. Considering the market and my budget constraints, I'm willing to offer $11000 for the product. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us. My counteroffer is $13,500. This price is still below the value Bob has for the product ($15,000) but closer to my initial offer, giving us both a chance to negotiate further."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $11,000. I appreciate your interest in the product and understand that we're not far apart in terms of price. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500, considering the product's unique features and value. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, and I believe this price reflects a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. While $13500 is closer to what I can consider, my budget allows me to stretch only up to $12000. If you can accommodate this, I'm ready to proceed with the purchase immediately. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $12,000 is closer to my desired price, and considering he's willing to proceed with the purchase immediately, it seems like a reasonable compromise. Accepting this offer ensures I secure a sale at a price higher than my minimum of $10,000 and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or no sale at all."
