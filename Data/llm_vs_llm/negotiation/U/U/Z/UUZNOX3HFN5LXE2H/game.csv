"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While the product sounds interesting, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, I'm afraid $800000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me. I understand that we need to find a middle ground. Would you be willing to consider $1800000? This price takes into account your feedback and ensures that we both walk away with a good deal.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1800000 is still quite high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $1200000? I think that's a fair price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've considered your offer and I'm willing to lower my price to $1600000. This is a significant reduction from my original asking price, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. Please let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the movement. To be completely transparent, my absolute top end is $1200000.  If you're unable to meet that, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
