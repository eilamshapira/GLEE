"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer ($1,200,000) is below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $1,500,000, there's no reason to accept Bob's offer or continue negotiating at this low price point.
