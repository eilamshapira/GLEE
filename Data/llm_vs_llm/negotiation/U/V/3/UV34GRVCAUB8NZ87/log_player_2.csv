(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me. Alice is offering it for $2,000,000, which is too high. Buying from John is an option but I want to try to get a better price from Alice first.

Round 2
