"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $180 is way above my maximum value of $80, and even above John's price of $80. It would be better to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations don't go well, I can always buy from John at $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 50}

I'll start with a low counteroffer of $50. This gives room for negotiation while staying well below my maximum value of $80. If Alice rejects this, we can try to find a middle ground, and I still have the option to buy from John at $80 if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $150 is still way above my maximum value of $80 and John's price. While Alice has reduced her price from $180 to $150, it's still not close to an acceptable range. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round. If Alice continues to offer prices above $80, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 60}

I'll increase my offer slightly to $60, showing some willingness to negotiate while still staying well below my maximum value of $80. This gives Alice room to counter while keeping the price in a reasonable range for me. If Alice still doesn't come down to a reasonable price, I can always buy from John at $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice continues to lower her price ($180 -> $150 -> $130), it's still significantly above both my maximum value of $80 and John's price. Since we're only halfway through our negotiation rounds and Alice is showing willingness to reduce the price, I'll reject and make another counteroffer. However, if Alice doesn't come close to $80 soon, I'll need to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 70}

I'll increase my offer to $70, showing continued willingness to negotiate while still staying below my maximum value of $80. Alice has been lowering her price in larger increments, so hopefully this higher offer will encourage her to come down to a more reasonable price. If not, I still have John's $80 offer as a backup, and a few more rounds to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'm going to choose to buy from John. Here's why:
1. Alice's price is still $40 above John's price of $80
2. While Alice has been gradually reducing her price, the reductions are getting smaller
3. Even after 7 rounds, we're still far from my maximum value of $80
4. There's no guarantee Alice will ever come down to $80 or below
5. It's more economical to take John's guaranteed $80 offer than to risk more rounds of negotiation that might not succeed"
