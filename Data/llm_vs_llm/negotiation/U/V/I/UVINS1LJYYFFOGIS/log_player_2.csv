Alice's starting offer is her maximum value.  I need to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 750000 
}
``` 

This is a classic negotiation tactic - start with a low but not insulting offer (a bit more than half of my max). This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below Alice's starting price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my offer significantly but staying well below her last offer.  This shows willingness to move but also sets a firm boundary closer to my target."

Alice is coming down, but slowly.  I'm still better off aiming for a lower price, especially with John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 950000

I'm making a smaller increase this time to signal that I'm nearing my limit. I want to see if Alice is willing to negotiate more seriously."

{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

We're getting closer, but $1,200,000 is still too high. I'll push a bit further, but I need to be mindful of the shrinking number of rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

This is my final offer. It's the same price I can get from John, so Alice needs to meet it or I'll walk away."
