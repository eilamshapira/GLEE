"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. It's a unique item with significant value. Considering its rarity and condition, I'm offering it to you for: 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Based on the information provided:

1. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to you
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $25,000
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $12,000

Since Alice's offer ($25,000) exceeds the maximum value the product has to you ($12,000) and is significantly higher than John's offer ($12,000), the rational choice would be to buy from John.
