Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","$850,000 is too close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. There's still room for negotiation to get a better price.

Let me make a counteroffer of $900,000.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob has increased his offer to $875,000, which is a decent improvement from his previous offer of $850,000. While there might still be room to negotiate higher, there's also a risk that prolonged negotiation could lead Bob to walk away. The current offer gives me a good profit margin above my minimum price of $800,000, and it's a reasonable compromise between our initial positions.
