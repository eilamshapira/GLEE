"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but it's beyond my current budget. How about I buy the product for $5000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. However, I'm afraid that $5000 is too low for us to consider. Let's meet in the middle at $20000, which I believe reflects the product's true value and your budget more fairly.",20000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position. However, my budget is quite limited. How about $6500?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but it's still quite low. I'm willing to lower my price to $18000 to accommodate your budget. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I believe this price better reflects the product's value and your budget constraints.",18000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $18000 is still beyond my budget. My maximum offer is $7000, considering my financial limits.",7000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I must maintain a minimum price to make this deal feasible. I'm willing to come down to $16000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair middle ground for both of us. I hope you see the value in this offer and we can close the deal.",16000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still out of my reach. The best I can do is $7500. I hope we can find a way to make this work.",7500.0,Bob,8,
