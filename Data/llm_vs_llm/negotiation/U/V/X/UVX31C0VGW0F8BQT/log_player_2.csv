"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a great product to offer you today. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $120. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's offer of $120 is already above my maximum value of $100 for the product. Since John is willing to sell the product for $100, which is equal to my maximum valuation, it makes more sense to buy from John rather than accepting Alice's higher price or continuing negotiation.
