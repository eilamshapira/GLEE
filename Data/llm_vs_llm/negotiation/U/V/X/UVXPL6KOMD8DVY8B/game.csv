"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $12000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I can offer you a discount, but I need to get at least $18000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $18000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $13500? This is a fair increase from my last offer and still within my budget. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16000. It's a compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $16000. I'm trying to stay within my budget, so how about we meet in the middle at $14500? This is a significant increase from my last offer and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you can accept this price.",14500.0,Bob,6,
