Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $12,000 is lower than the minimum value of $15,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $15,000, I will reject Bob's offer. However, before selling to John, I want to try to negotiate a better price with Bob. 

So, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to send a counteroffer.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $20,000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I can offer you a discount, but I need to get at least $18,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $18000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $13500? This is a fair increase from my last offer and still within my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $13,500 is still lower than the price I was hoping to get, but closer to my target, I will consider it. However, I also have the option to sell the product to John for $15,000, which is higher than Bob's current offer.

Given that Bob has increased his offer from $12,000 to $13,500, it shows that he is interested in the product and willing to negotiate. I will reject his current offer, but I will also make a counteroffer that is lower than my previous one to see if we can meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I will send a new counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000. It's a compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 16000}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $16000. I'm trying to stay within my budget, so how about we meet in the middle at $14500? This is a significant increase from my last offer and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you can accept this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $14,500 is very close to the price I can get from John ($15,000), and I've been negotiating with Bob for a while, I think it's time to consider the alternative option.

Given that Bob's offer is only $500 less than what I can get from John, and I don't know if Bob will be willing to increase his offer further, I think it's a good idea to sell the product to John for $15,000. This way, I can ensure that I get a price that is at least $15,000, which is the minimum value of the product to me.
