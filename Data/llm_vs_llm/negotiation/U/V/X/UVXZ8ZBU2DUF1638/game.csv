"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product.  Given its unique qualities, I'm initially proposing a price of $20000. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay for this product. I know there are similar products available in the market for much less. I would be willing to pay $6000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $6000 significantly undervalues the unique aspects of this product.  I'm confident it offers benefits you won't find elsewhere. To move us closer, I'd be willing to consider $16000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $16000 is still much higher than what I can justify paying. I have another seller offering the same product for $8000, but I'm willing to work with you if we can reach a reasonable price. I can offer $7000, which is better than my previous offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the $7000 offer is still significantly below the value this product delivers. While I want to find common ground, I need to be realistic about the worth of what I'm offering. Could you consider $13000? This feels like a fair compromise recognizing the unique value this brings.",13000.0,Alice,5,
