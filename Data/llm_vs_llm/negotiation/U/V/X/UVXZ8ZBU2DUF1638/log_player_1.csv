Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay for this product. I know there are similar products available in the market for much less. I would be willing to pay $6000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 significantly undervalues the unique aspects of this product.  I'm confident it offers benefits you won't find elsewhere. To move us closer, I'd be willing to consider $16,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $16000 is still much higher than what I can justify paying. I have another seller offering the same product for $8000, but I'm willing to work with you if we can reach a reasonable price. I can offer $7000, which is better than my previous offer.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the $7,000 offer is still significantly below the value this product delivers.
