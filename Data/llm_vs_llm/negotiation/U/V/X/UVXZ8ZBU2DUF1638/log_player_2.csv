"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product.  Given its unique qualities, I'm initially proposing a price of $20000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $20,000 is way above my maximum value of $8,000. Since I can always buy from John for $8,000, there's no reason to accept such a high price. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20,000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay for this product. I know there are similar products available in the market for much less. I would be willing to pay $6,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 6000}

I'm starting with an offer below John's price of $8,000 to leave room for negotiation, while still being reasonable. Since I know I can always buy from John at $8,000, I want to try to get a better deal from Alice if possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $6000 significantly undervalues the unique aspects of this product.  I'm confident it offers benefits you won't find elsewhere. To move us closer, I'd be willing to consider $16000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $16,000 is still far above my maximum value of $8,000 and John's price. While she has reduced the price, it's not enough to make it attractive compared to my alternative option. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $16,000 is still much higher than what I can justify paying. I have another seller offering the same product for $8,000, but I'm willing to work with you if we can reach a reasonable price. I can offer $7,000, which is better than my previous offer."", ""product_price"": 7000}

I'm increasing my offer to $7,000 to show good faith in negotiation while being transparent about my alternative option. This price is still below John's price, giving me room to potentially negotiate further if needed, but also letting Alice know that I have a clear alternative at $8,000 which effectively sets my maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the $7000 offer is still significantly below the value this product delivers. While I want to find common ground, I need to be realistic about the worth of what I'm offering. Could you consider $13000? This feels like a fair compromise recognizing the unique value this brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, it's clear that Alice is not willing to come down to a price near $8,000. She has moved from $20,000 to $16,000 to $13,000, but each counter-offer suggests she values the product much higher than my maximum value of $8,000. Given that we're already in round 5 and the gap is still very large, it's unlikely we'll reach an agreement below $8,000. Therefore, the most rational decision is to take John's offer at $8,000 rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to succeed."
