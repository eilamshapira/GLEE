"Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and Alice's offer is $160, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer. I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is reasonable and within my budget. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a low offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's new offer of $130 is still above my budget of $100. While it's lower than her initial offer, I'm not willing to pay that much for the product.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and consider making another counteroffer. However, since I have the option to buy the product from John for $100, which is within my budget, I might not want to negotiate further if Alice's next offer isn't significantly lower.

For now, I'll reject Alice's offer and think about my next move.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer is still above my budget, I'll make another counteroffer that's closer to my target price. I'll try to meet Alice halfway between her last offer and my previous counteroffer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's new offer of $110 is still slightly above my budget of $100, but it's getting closer. However, I have the option to buy the product from John for $100, which is a better deal for me.

At this point, I don't see a reason to continue negotiating with Alice when I can get the product for a lower price from John.
