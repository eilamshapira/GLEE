"Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product to me first. I'm interested in buying it, but I think $150 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $80 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and meeting me halfway. However, $125 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $90. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer! $90 is still a bit low for me, but I understand budgets. Let's try $115. This is the lowest I can realistically go.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $115 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable paying. Considering you said $115 is the lowest you can realistically go, I'll try to meet you closer to that. How about $100? This is the highest I'm willing to go.",100.0,Bob,6,
