"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product, and I believe it would be a great fit for you. Considering its value, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1199999. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,199,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,199,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $1,199,999 exceeds that value, it would be financially beneficial for me to explore other options.
