"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $1100000 is a bit too high for me. Considering my budget, I'd be more comfortable with a price of $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I appreciate your candidness. However, $900000 is a bit lower than I can accept. How about we meet halfway at $1000000? This way, we both give a little and gain a lot. Looking forward to your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
