Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my options carefully. The product is worth at least $150 to me, and Bob values it at $120. If Bob rejects my offer, I can sell to John for $150.

Given that Bob won't pay more than his valuation of $120, and that's less than my minimum acceptable price of $150, it makes the most sense for me to make an offer that moves directly to my guaranteed alternative with John.
