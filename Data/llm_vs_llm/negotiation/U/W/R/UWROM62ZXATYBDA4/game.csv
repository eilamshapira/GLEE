"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. However, the price of $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $60 is too low for this item's value. I understand that $180 might be higher than what you were looking for, so I'm willing to come down to $150. This is a quality product that's worth significantly more than $60. Let me know if this works better for you.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $150, but it's still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
