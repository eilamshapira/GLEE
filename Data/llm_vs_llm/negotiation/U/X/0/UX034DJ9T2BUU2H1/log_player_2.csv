"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $14,000, I need to consider my alternatives.

This product is worth up to $15,000 to me, so Alice's price is below my maximum. If I buy from John, I'd pay $15,000, which is $1,000 more than Alice's offer.

However, I could potentially negotiate a better price with Alice. Since the product is worth $10,000 to her, there's room for negotiation between $10,000 and $14,000 that would benefit both of us.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her price from $14,000 to $13,500, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is still $1,500 less than John's price of $15,000, so walking away to buy from John wouldn't make sense.

Since Alice rejected my offer of $11,500 but came down $500 from her initial price, there's still room to negotiate. The product is worth $10,000 to her, so she has room to go lower while still making a profit.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I see that Alice has reduced her price again, now offering $13,000. This is another $500 less than her previous offer of $13,500, and $2,000 less than John's price.

Alice continues to move in my direction, coming down by $500 each time. She rejected my offer of $12,000, but her movement suggests we might be able to meet somewhere in the middle.

Since the price is continuing to drop and is already significantly better than John's alternative, I'll continue negotiating.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Interesting! Alice has now offered $12,500, which is exactly the same as my last counteroffer. This indicates she's willing to meet me at this price point.

At $12,500, this is:
- $2,500 less than John's price of $15,000
- $2,500 more than Alice's cost of $10,000
- $2,500 less than my maximum value of $15,000

This is a fair middle ground that gives both Alice and me equal surplus from the deal. Given that Alice has matched my counteroffer, and we've reached a fair split of the potential surplus, I'll accept this offer.
