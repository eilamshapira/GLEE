"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way too high, exceeding your budget. It's better to reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price. Buying from John immediately guarantees you the product within your budget. However, there's a chance you can get a better deal with Alice if you counteroffer effectively."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what you are willing to pay. While it's closer to your budget, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. You might be able to get a better deal by continuing the negotiation process. If you reject, you can make a new counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further. Buying from John is always an option, but it's not the most advantageous if you believe you can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $1,100,000, which is a significant decrease from Alice's last offer of $1,400,000.  This is a compromise that reflects a willingness to negotiate while still staying within my budget. It also leaves room for Alice to potentially counteroffer without feeling forced to accept my exact price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,300,000 is still outside my preferred budget. It's becoming clear that Alice is not willing to go lower, and I don't want to risk getting stuck in a lengthy negotiation.  Buying from John guarantees me the product for my maximum price point, and it's time to cut my losses and move forward with a secure purchase."
