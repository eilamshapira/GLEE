Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This is a starting point for negotiation. It's a significant saving from both Alice's initial offer and John's price, but it allows room for negotiation."

We're getting close, but it's worth pushing a little further to see if we can get a slightly better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 11500

This offer splits the difference between our last offer and Alice's current offer. It's a fair compromise that benefits both parties."

}
```

This offer is a good compromise.  It's close enough to Alice's valuation that it's unlikely she'll go much lower, and it saves me a significant amount compared to John's price."
