"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale for $150. I think it's a great deal, let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to consider whether to accept Alice's offer or go with John's guaranteed price.

Alice is offering the product for $150, but the product is worth no more than $100 to me. John is willing to sell me the same product for $100.

Since Alice's price ($150) exceeds both the value I place on the product ($100) and John's alternative price ($100), I should not accept Alice's offer.
