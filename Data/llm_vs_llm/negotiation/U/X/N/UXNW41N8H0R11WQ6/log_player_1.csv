"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a high initial offer to test Bob's willingness to pay and leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and even below John's guaranteed offer. It would be irrational to accept this offer when I have a better alternative.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a new counteroffer in the next round, lowering my initial price somewhat but still keeping it well above my minimum threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's initial offer was quite low at $500,000, I'll reduce my price from the initial $2,000,000, but still maintain a high enough price to leave room for negotiation while staying well above my $1,000,000 minimum.

{""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob has only increased his offer by $100,000, still far below John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000. Since we're now in round 4 and Bob's offers are remaining well below my minimum acceptable price, it's becoming clear that Bob might not be willing to meet my minimum threshold. Rather than waste more rounds of negotiation, it's best to take John's guaranteed offer.
