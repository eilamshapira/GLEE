"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is far too high. We have plenty of room to negotiate downward and should aim for a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 500000}

This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still provides some room for negotiation upwards if needed.  It will be interesting to see Alice's reaction to this counter-offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice moved down significantly, $1,750,000 is still far too high. We need to show Alice we're serious about a much lower price point.  We're still better off negotiating at this stage than taking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 600000}

We are increasing our offer slightly to show flexibility, but we're still aiming for a price significantly below Alice's last offer. This should encourage her to negotiate more seriously if she is truly interested in selling."
