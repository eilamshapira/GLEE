"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll analyze the options:

1. Alice's offer: $10,000
2. John's price: $15,000
3. My maximum value for the product: $15,000

Alice's offer ($10,000) is:
- Below my maximum value ($15,000)
- $5,000 less than John's price
- Saves me money compared to all alternatives

Since Alice's offer is significantly lower than both my maximum value and John's price, it's the most economical choice.
