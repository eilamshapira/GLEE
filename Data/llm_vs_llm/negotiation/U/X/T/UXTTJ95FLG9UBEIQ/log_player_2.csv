(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","The offer from Alice is $20,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum valuation of the product ($8,000) and higher than John's price ($8,000). It doesn't make sense to accept this offer since I can get the same product for much less from John.
