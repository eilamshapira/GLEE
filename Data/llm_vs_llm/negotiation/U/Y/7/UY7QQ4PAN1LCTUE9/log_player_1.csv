Send your offer to Bob.,"I want to analyze this situation carefully.

From my perspective as Alice:
- The product is worth at least $12,000 to me
- I have a guaranteed backup buyer (John) at $12,000
- Bob values the product at $10,000

Since Bob only values the product at $10,000, he won't accept any offer above that amount. Also, since I have a guaranteed sale to John at $12,000, I shouldn't sell for less than that amount.

Given these constraints, I should offer the product to Bob at a price that makes economic sense for me, which is at least $12,000. Since this exceeds Bob's valuation, he will likely reject it, and I'll sell to John instead.
