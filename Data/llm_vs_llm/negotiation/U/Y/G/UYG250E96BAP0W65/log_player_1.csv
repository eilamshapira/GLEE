Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is lower than my minimum acceptable price and also lower than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

My counteroffer to Bob will be $1,400,000.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my new offer is: 
{""product_price"": 1400000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still lower than what I was hoping to get, but closer to my target, and also higher than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further to get a better price.

My counteroffer to Bob will be $1,375,000.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my new offer is: 
{""product_price"": 1375000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is the same as what I can get from John, and I've already invested time and effort into negotiating with Bob, I'll consider accepting his offer. However, I'll also think about the possibility of getting a slightly better deal from Bob.

Given that Bob's offer is now equal to my minimum acceptable price and the price John is offering, I will accept Bob's offer to avoid further negotiation and potential risks.

My decision is: 
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
