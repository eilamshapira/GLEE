"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a unique product that I believe will be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I'm confident it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to part with it for $950000, which represents a significant opportunity for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than the $1,000,000 I'm willing to pay and also less than what I can buy it from John for, it seems like a good deal.
