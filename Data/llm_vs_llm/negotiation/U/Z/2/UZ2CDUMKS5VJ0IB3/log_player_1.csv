"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a great product to offer you today. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $120. This is a fair price considering its features and benefits. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value you see in it, but considering my budget constraints, I can offer you $70 for the product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since $70 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80, and I believe we can reach a better agreement than selling to John immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot go that low. The product's quality and market value are significantly higher. I can come down to $100, which is already a considerable reduction from my initial offer. This is a fair price that reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I need to stay within my budget constraints. My best offer would be $75. Let me know if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's highest offer is $75, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80, and he's only increased his offer by $5, it seems unlikely we'll reach an agreement above $80. Therefore, I'll take the guaranteed $80 from John."
