Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a reasonably high offer to leave room for negotiation while still trying to maximize my profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer ($800,000) is significantly lower than John's guaranteed offer ($1,000,000), and even below my minimum acceptable value, I will sell to John.
