"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to me and Alice's offer of $1,300,000 exceeds that value, it doesn't make sense to accept the offer as it is more than what the product is worth to me. Additionally, I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which aligns with the product's worth to me. However, before making a final decision, I'd like to see if Alice is willing to negotiate the price down. Therefore, the best course of action at this point is to reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer, hoping to find a mutually agreeable price or to test Alice's flexibility on the price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that the product is worth $1,000,000 to me and I'm looking to save as much money as possible, my initial counteroffer should be lower than Alice's initial offer but still within a reasonable range to encourage further negotiation. A good starting point could be to offer a price that is significantly lower than Alice's offer to create room for negotiation.
