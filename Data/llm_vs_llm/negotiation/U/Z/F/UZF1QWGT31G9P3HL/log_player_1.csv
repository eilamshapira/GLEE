Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price to offer Bob that maximizes my earnings while ensuring he's likely to accept.

Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, he would gain value from any price below that. However, if he rejects, I can still sell to John for $80.

I should offer a price that's low enough that Bob feels he's getting a good deal, but high enough that I maximize my profit. If I price too close to $120, Bob might reject it. A reasonable price would be around $100, which gives Bob a $20 surplus while giving me $20 more than my fallback option with John.
