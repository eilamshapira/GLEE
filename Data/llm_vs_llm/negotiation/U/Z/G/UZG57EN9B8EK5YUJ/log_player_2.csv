"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to evaluate Alice's offer compared to my alternatives. Alice is offering the product for $150, which is exactly the maximum value I place on the product. However, John is also offering the product for $150, so I don't gain anything by accepting Alice's offer immediately.

Since I have 10 rounds of negotiation available and my goal is to save as much money as possible, I should try to negotiate a better price with Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $150 is at the top of my budget. I could do $100 for it. This would be a great help for me financially while still giving you a reasonable return. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob! I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer you the product for $125. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has lowered her price to $125, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $150. This is now $25 less than both my maximum value and John's alternative price.

Since my goal is to save money while still acquiring the product, and Alice has shown flexibility by coming down in price, I should accept this offer. While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice would lower the price more, and I risk losing this favorable deal.
