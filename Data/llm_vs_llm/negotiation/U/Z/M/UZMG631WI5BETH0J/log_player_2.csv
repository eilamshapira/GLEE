"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given the information, I need to make a decision based on what's best for me financially. Here's my analysis:

1. Alice is offering the product for $11,000
2. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me
3. John is offering the same product for $10,000
4. Alice's product is worth $10,000 to her, so there might be room for negotiation

Since Alice's offer is $11,000, which is higher than the product's value to me ($10,000) and higher than John's price ($10,000), the rational choice is to either buy from John or try to negotiate with Alice.

Since I can get the product from John for exactly what it's worth to me ($10,000), and Alice's current offer exceeds this price, the best decision is:
