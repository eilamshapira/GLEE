"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it holds incredible value. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Given the information:

1. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to you
2. Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000
3. John is willing to sell you the same product for $1,000,000

Alice's offer exceeds the maximum value of the product to you ($1,000,000), and it's also higher than John's offer. There's no reason to pay more than what the product is worth to you, or to pay more than what another seller is charging.
