"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept.  This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I need to try to get a higher price.  I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum. I believe this price is a good compromise."
