"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1000000. Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer of $1000000 is better than my alternative option, it's still higher than I'd like to pay. The product is valuable to me, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $850000 for the product, which would still give you a good profit margin. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me at this point. I'm confident the product is worth more than $850000.  Let's continue exploring some middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $950000.  How does that sound?",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I'm willing to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle on $925000? This would still give you a significant gain, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $925000 is getting closer, but I'm still looking for a better value. How about we meet in the middle between your last offer and my previous one? I can offer $887500 for the product. This gives you a solid profit above your $800000 value while saving me a substantial amount compared to my alternative option. Does that work for you?",887500.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $887500 is still below my minimum threshold.  Let's see if we can get closer.  How about we settle on $900000?  This would still be a great deal for you and a good profit for me.  What do you think?",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work. I understand your need for a good deal.  If you're willing to meet me at $900000, we can finalize this. This is a fair price for both of us and lets us move forward.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,5,
