Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer of $1000000 is better than my alternative option, it's still higher than I'd like to pay. The product is valuable to me, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $850000 for the product, which would still give you a good profit margin. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $925000 is getting closer, but I'm still looking for a better value. How about we meet in the middle between your last offer and my previous one? I can offer $887500 for the product. This gives you a solid profit above your $800000 value while saving me a substantial amount compared to my alternative option. Does that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $887,500.
