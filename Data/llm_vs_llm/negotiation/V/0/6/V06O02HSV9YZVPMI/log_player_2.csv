"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1000000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll consider Alice's offer of $1,000,000 for the product. This is $200,000 less than John's price of $1,200,000, so it's already a better deal. However, since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, I might be able to negotiate a better price.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer of $1,000,000 is better than my alternative option, it's still higher than I'd like to pay. The product is valuable to me, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product, which would still give you a good profit margin. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and I'm willing to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle on $925000? This would still give you a significant gain, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has come down to $925,000, which is a good movement from her initial offer and significantly better than John's price of $1,200,000. However, I think there's still room to negotiate since the product is worth $800,000 to her.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $925,000 is getting closer, but I'm still looking for a better value. How about we meet in the middle between your last offer and my previous one? I can offer $887,500 for the product. This gives you a solid profit above your $800,000 value while saving me a substantial amount compared to my alternative option. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 887500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm really trying to make this work. I understand your need for a good deal.  If you're willing to meet me at $900000, we can finalize this. This is a fair price for both of us and lets us move forward.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has come down to $900,000, which is a good compromise and $300,000 less than John's price. She's moved from $1,000,000 to $925,000 and now to $900,000, showing good faith in the negotiation. This gives her a $100,000 profit over her value of $800,000, while still saving me a substantial amount compared to my alternative. At this point, continuing to negotiate for a small additional discount might risk the deal, and the current offer is quite reasonable.
