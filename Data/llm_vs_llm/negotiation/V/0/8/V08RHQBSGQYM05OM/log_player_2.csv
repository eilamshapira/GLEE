"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I’m excited to offer you this exclusive product that stands apart in quality and prestige. I’m prepared to sell it to you for $1600000—a price that reflects its exceptional value. Please let me know if you’d like to proceed, as I have another committed buyer at $1500000. I look forward to your prompt response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Looking at Alice's offer and my options:

1. Alice is offering the product for $1,600,000
2. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me
3. I can buy from John for $1,000,000

Since Alice's price ($1,600,000) exceeds both the value to me and John's price, the rational choice is to buy from John.
