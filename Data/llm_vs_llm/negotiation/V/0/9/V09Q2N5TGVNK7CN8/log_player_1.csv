Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $15,000 minimum to me (as I can sell it to John for this amount)
2. The product is worth $8,000 to Bob
3. Bob will reject any offer above $8,000 (as it would be a loss for him)
4. If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed $15,000 from John

Since I can get $15,000 guaranteed from John, and Bob won't pay more than $8,000, it makes the most sense to offer Bob a price above $8,000, ensuring he rejects it so I can sell to John for $15,000.
