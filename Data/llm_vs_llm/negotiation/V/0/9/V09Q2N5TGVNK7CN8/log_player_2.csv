"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since Alice's offer of $10,000 is higher than my maximum value of $8,000, and John is offering the product at exactly $8,000, I should go with John's offer to maximize my savings.
