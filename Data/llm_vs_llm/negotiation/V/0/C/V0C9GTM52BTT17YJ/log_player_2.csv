# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I think this product will bring great value to you, and I'm pleased to offer it to you at a competitive price of $13000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

While $13,000 is less than John's offer, it's still significantly higher than Alice's perceived value of the product. There's room for negotiation."
