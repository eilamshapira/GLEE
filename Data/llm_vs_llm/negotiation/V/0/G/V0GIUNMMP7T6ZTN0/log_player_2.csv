"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Okay, let's analyze the situation.

*   **Alice's Offer:** $1,400,000
*   **My Valuation:** I value the product at $1,500,000.
*   **John's Offer:** $1,500,000

I should accept Alice's offer immediately. Buying from Alice at $1,400,000 is cheaper than both my valuation and buying from John.
