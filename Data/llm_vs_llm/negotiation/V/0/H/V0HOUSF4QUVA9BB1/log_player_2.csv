"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and quality, I believe it would be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for the price of $2000000. I am confident you will find the value it brings to be well worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $2,000,000, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer. Additionally, I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within my budget.
