"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Given that Alice's offer is $1,500,000 and John is also willing to sell the product for $1,500,000, there is no financial advantage to buying from Alice. Since the goal is to save as much money as possible and there is no negotiation happening, the best decision is to buy from John, as it ensures you get the product at the value you are willing to pay.
