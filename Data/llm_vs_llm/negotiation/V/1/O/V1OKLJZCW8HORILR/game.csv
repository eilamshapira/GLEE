"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $150 is more than I can justify spending. I know a comparable product is available elsewhere for $120. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $100 for the product, which would give you a quick sale without me having to look elsewhere.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better price, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $100 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's try $125, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your offer of $125 is getting closer, but I need to be straightforward with you - I can purchase this same product from another seller for $120, which is actually the maximum I'm willing to pay based on my budget and the product's value to me. If you can match or beat $115, I'd be happy to do business with you instead. This would save me the hassle of going elsewhere while still giving you a sale.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your honesty about your budget and the product's value to you. I appreciate your willingness to work with me instead of going to another seller. Considering you mentioned $120 as the maximum you're willing to pay, I'm willing to make a concession. I'll meet you at $120, which is a fair price considering the product's value. If you're willing to pay $120, I'm happy to accept that and we can finalize the deal.",120.0,Alice,5,
