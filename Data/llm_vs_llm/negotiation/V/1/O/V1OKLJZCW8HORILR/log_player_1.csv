"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $150 is more than I can justify spending. I know a comparable product is available elsewhere for $120. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $100 for the product, which would give you a quick sale without me having to look elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $100 because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price. In the next round, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better price, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $100 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's try $125, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your offer of $125 is getting closer, but I need to be straightforward with you - I can purchase this same product from another seller for $120, which is actually the maximum I'm willing to pay based on my budget and the product's value to me. If you can match or beat $115, I'd be happy to do business with you instead. This would save me the hassle of going elsewhere while still giving you a sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $115 because it's still below my target price, and I believe I can get a better deal. Since Bob mentioned that $120 is the maximum he's willing to pay, I'll try to meet him closer to that price in the next round. I'm not ready to give up on the negotiation yet, and selling to John for $150 is still an option if the negotiation doesn't go in my favor."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your honesty about your budget and the product's value to you. I appreciate your willingness to work with me instead of going to another seller. Considering you mentioned $120 as the maximum you're willing to pay, I'm willing to make a concession. I'll meet you at $120, which is a fair price considering the product's value. If you're willing to pay $120, I'm happy to accept that and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 120}"
