"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","The offer from Alice is $200, which is higher than what the product is worth to me (no more than $150). It's also higher than John's price of $150. 

Since I can get the product from John for $150, and this matches the maximum amount I value the product at, I should choose to buy from John rather than accept Alice's inflated price or engage in further negotiation.
