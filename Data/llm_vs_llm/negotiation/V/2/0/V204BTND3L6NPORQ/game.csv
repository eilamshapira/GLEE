"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20000 is a bit too high for me. I see value in the product, but I need a price that works for me. Would you consider $8000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $8000. I understand that you see value in the product, but I'm afraid $8000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $18000, which I believe better reflects the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10000, but that's my limit. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $10000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. After considering your offer, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $12500. This price takes into account your budget constraints while also ensuring I receive a fair value for the product. If this price works for you, I'm willing to accept it. Let me know your thoughts.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the effort to find a compromise.  However, $12500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11250. This is my final offer, as I need to stay within my budget.  Let me know if this works for you.",11250.0,Bob,6,
