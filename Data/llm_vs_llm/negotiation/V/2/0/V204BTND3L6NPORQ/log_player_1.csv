Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20000 is a bit too high for me. I see value in the product, but I need a price that works for me. Would you consider $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $8,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and I believe the product is worth more. I'll try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. 

My counteroffer: $18,000"

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob, as $10,000 is still lower than I'm comfortable with, but I sense that Bob is serious about buying the product and is willing to negotiate. I'll try to find a price that works for both of us.

My counteroffer: $12,500 

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."

Since Bob's final offer of $11,250 is still lower than the $15,000 that John is willing to pay, I've decided to sell the product to John. This ensures I receive a higher price for the product, which is my primary goal."
