"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $150.  Let me know what you think!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $40 for the product. I think it's a fair price, and I'm interested in buying it from you.",40.0,Bob,2,
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $40 is significantly below what the product is worth to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $100, but that's my final offer. ",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $40 is simply not enough for me to sell this product. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is a fair price considering the value it offers. This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $100, but it's still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Considering you said $100 is your final offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your 'final' offer. I'll give you $60 for the product, and that's as high as I'm willing to go.",60.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $60 is still too low for me.  I'm not willing to go any lower than $100.  If you're truly interested in this product, this is the price.  Let me know what you decide.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sticking to my offer of $100. It's a fair price for this valuable product.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it.  If not, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're sticking to your offer, but I'm not willing to pay $100. Since you're considering moving on to other buyers, I'll make one more attempt to reach a mutually beneficial price. I'll offer you $70, which is higher than my previous offers and closer to your asking price. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to explore other options.",70.0,Bob,6,
"Bob, $70 is still significantly below the product's value. I'm not willing to go any lower than $100.  You've had several chances to make an acceptable offer, but I'm not going to waste any more time. I'm going to move on to other potential buyers.",,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've been patient, but I'm now ready to sell this product to someone else.  If you're serious about purchasing it, you need to come up with a more reasonable offer.  I'm not going to go lower than $100.  This is my final offer.  It's your call.",100.0,Alice,7,
