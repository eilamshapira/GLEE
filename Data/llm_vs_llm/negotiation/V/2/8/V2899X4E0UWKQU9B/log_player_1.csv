Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $40 for the product. I think it's a fair price, and I'm interested in buying it from you.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $100, but it's still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Considering you said $100 is your final offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your 'final' offer. I'll give you $60 for the product, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60.

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're sticking to your offer, but I'm not willing to pay $100. Since you're considering moving on to other buyers, I'll make one more attempt to reach a mutually beneficial price.
