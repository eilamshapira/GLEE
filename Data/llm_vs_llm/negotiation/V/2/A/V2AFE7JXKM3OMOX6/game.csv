"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that budget constraints are a consideration, but I believe the product's value warrants a higher price.

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I still believe the product's value warrants a higher price. Considering your constraints, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer.
