Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I'm prepared to offer $700000 for it, considering other options available to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me, and I have a better alternative with John, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that budget constraints are a consideration, but I believe the product's value warrants a higher price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
