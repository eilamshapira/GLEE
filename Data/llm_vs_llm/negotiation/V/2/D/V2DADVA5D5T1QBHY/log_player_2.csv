"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: $1,000,000
2. Buy from John: $1,200,000
3. Reject Alice's offer without buying from John

Alice's offer ($1,000,000) is $200,000 less than John's price ($1,200,000). Since Alice's price is below my maximum value ($1,200,000) and it's the lowest available option, it's the most economical choice.
