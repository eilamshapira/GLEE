Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. Since I know I can sell the product to John for $80, that's my guaranteed minimum. Bob's value for the product is unknown, but I should try to get more than my minimum. Setting the price too high risks rejection, while too low leaves money on the table. A reasonable markup would be to try selling at $120, which gives Bob room to get value while giving me a good profit over my fallback option.
