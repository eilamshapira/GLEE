"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a lower price.",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. The price you proposed is quite low. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer you the product for $150. Let me know if that works for you!",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to consider that?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I really appreciate your interest, but $75 is below the value I can consider. I can lower my offer to $140 as a final step from my side. Hope we can make this work!",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $75 was a bit low. I'm willing to meet you closer to your price, but $140 is still a bit steep for me. How about we split the difference between your offer and mine? I'd be willing to pay $107.50.",107.5,Bob,6,
