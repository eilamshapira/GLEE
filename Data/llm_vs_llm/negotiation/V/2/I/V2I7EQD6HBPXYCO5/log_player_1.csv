"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I get a good return.

{""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and the product's value to Bob ($800,000). Since I can sell to John for $800,000, there's no reason to accept an offer this low. However, since we still have several rounds for negotiation, I'll reject and make a counteroffer rather than immediately selling to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still maintain a price above $800,000 to leave room for negotiation while ensuring profitability.

{""product_price"": 875000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer of $750,000 is still below what I can get from John ($800,000), and we're already in round 4. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $800,000, there's no reason to accept less. At this point, rather than continuing negotiations that might not reach $800,000, it's safer to take the guaranteed deal with John.
