Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $13,000. While it's above my minimum threshold of $12,000, there's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob since the product is worth $15,000 to him.
