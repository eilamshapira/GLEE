It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $1,150,000 is still too high.  Let's see if we can get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Let's start with a significant drop to see how she reacts.  I'm willing to pay a good price, but I'm hoping to come in below $1 million."

Alice is still too high.  I'm willing to go a bit higher, but $1,100,000 is still too much.  Let's see if we can close the gap a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm willing to go up a bit more, but I'm sticking to my goal of staying below $1,100,000."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, I think it's time to close the deal. $1,075,000 is still a good deal for me, and I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate.  Let's go ahead and buy the product."
