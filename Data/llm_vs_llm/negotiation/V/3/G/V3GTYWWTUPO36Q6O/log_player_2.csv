(Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice. Since the product is worth $150 to me, paying $200 is not a good deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.)

Your counteroffer: $120

(I'm starting with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. Since the product is worth $150 to both of us, there might be room for agreement.)"
