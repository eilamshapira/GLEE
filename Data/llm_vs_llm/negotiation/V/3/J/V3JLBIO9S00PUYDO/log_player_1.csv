Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that the product is worth $1,500,000 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price, I'll start with a high offer to Bob to see if there's any room for negotiation while maintaining my minimum acceptable value.

{""product_price"": 1,800,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000 (which I can get from John), and it's even below Bob's own valuation of $800,000, there's no point in continuing negotiations with Bob. The best decision is to sell to John.
