"Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $5000, considering the market value and my own financial constraints.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but $5000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'll lower my initial offer, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and lower your initial offer. However, $18000 is still quite high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new offer. I'd like to propose a price of $6500.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, $6500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm trying to be flexible, so I'll make another concession. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $15000 is still significantly higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer again, but I need to stay within my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $7000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.",7000.0,Bob,6,
