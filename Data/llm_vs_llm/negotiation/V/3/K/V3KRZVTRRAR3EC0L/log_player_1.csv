Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $5000, considering the market value and my own financial constraints.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $5,000 because it's significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product, which is $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a more reasonable offer. I'll proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer that better reflects the product's value."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and lower your initial offer. However, $18000 is still quite high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new offer. I'd like to propose a price of $6500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500

I reject Bob's offer of $6,500 because it's still below the minimum value I have for the product, which is $15,000. While I appreciate Bob's effort to meet halfway, the proposed price is not reasonable for me. I'll proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer, trying to find a price that works for both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $15000 is still significantly higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer again, but I need to stay within my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $7000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

I decide to sell the product to John for $15,000. Although Bob has increased his offer to $7,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. Given that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, which meets my minimum value, I choose to end the negotiation with Bob and secure a sale at a price that I'm comfortable with."
