Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my pricing strategy. I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I have John as a guaranteed backup buyer at exactly that price. When setting my price for Bob, I need to balance the risk of rejection with the potential for higher profit.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll set a price that's significantly higher than my guaranteed alternative, but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected. A reasonable approach would be to ask for approximately 50% more than my guaranteed fallback option.
