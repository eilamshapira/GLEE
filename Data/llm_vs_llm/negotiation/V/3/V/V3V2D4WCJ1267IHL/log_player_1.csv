Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this incredible product. Considering its unique value, I'm prepared to offer it to you at the price of:"", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. Considering the product's value to me, I'd like to propose a counteroffer.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, let's try to get closer to my ideal price. Here's my counteroffer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think we can find a better price. I'm willing to increase my previous offer, but I'd like to propose a price that's closer to my initial target.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Okay, Bob is still lowballing me. Accepting $950,000 is below my minimum value. I need to keep negotiating. The best option is to see if I can get a higher price from Bob or sell the product to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, let's try to get this deal closer to where I want it. I'll try a slightly more aggressive approach:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","This is a tough one. Bob's offer of $975,000 is still below what the product is worth to me. However, I'm only $25,000 away from a deal that's worth $1,000,000 to me, and only a little less then what I'm willing to sell to John. I have 4 rounds left to negotiate. I think it's time to make the hard decision.
