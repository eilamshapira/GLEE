"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Based on the information provided, I need to make a smart purchasing decision.

Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay (as the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me).

John is also offering the product for $12,000.

Since both offers are at the same price point, and there's no mentioned difference in product quality or other factors, there's no financial advantage to choosing one seller over the other.

I might as well accept Alice's offer since she made the initial proposal.
