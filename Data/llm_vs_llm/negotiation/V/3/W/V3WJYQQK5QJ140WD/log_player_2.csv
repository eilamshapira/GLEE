"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to offer you my product for $180. It's a great value and I think you'll be very pleased with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $180 against my maximum value of $80 and John's guaranteed price of $80.

Alice is offering the product for $180, which is significantly above my maximum value of $80. Since I can get the exact same product from John for $80 (which is exactly my maximum value), there's no reason to accept Alice's high offer or even continue negotiating.
