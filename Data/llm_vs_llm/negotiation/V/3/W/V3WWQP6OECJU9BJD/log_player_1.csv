Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's quite a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. I'm looking for something more in the range of $750000. Could you do that? Let me know if you can adjust your price accordingly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $750,000, which is significantly less than my minimum value of $1,000,000 and the product's true worth, I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, Bob, I appreciate your initial interest, but I can't accept that low of an offer. This product is truly exceptional.

{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I understand your budget considerations, the value of this product is significantly higher. I am willing to lower the price, but I can't go down to $750,000. Considering its rarity and potential, I'm prepared to offer it to you for $2,200,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2200000 is still quite high for me. I'm looking to spend around $1000000 for this product. If you can meet this price, please let me know, and we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","This is a critical decision point. Bob's new offer is exactly at my minimum acceptable price. I also know John is willing to pay the same amount. While I can continue to negotiate with Bob, I'm not sure how far he will go. It's risky to continue negotiating with him because he may not be willing to go higher than $1,000,000. Since my goal is to maximize my earnings, and I already have a firm offer of $1,000,000, I will take the offer.
