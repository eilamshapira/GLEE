"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire a product that holds significant value. While I can't disclose the exact nature of the product just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $800000 to me.  I'm confident it will be even more valuable to the right buyer, and I believe that buyer could be you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. This is a chance to secure a potentially lucrative asset. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer, reject it, or buy from John.

Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, while John would sell it for $1,200,000.

Since:
- The product is worth up to $1,200,000 to me
- Alice's offer is $1,000,000, which is $200,000 less than what I would pay John
- Alice's offer is less than my maximum valuation

The rational choice is to accept Alice's offer and save $200,000 compared to buying from John.
