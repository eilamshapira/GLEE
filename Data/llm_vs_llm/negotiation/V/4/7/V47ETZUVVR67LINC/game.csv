"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, I believe your asking price is a bit high. Given market conditions and comparable products, I would like to propose $1275000. This represents a fair value that would make this deal beneficial for both of us. I look forward to your response.",1275000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1275000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. It's unique and offers significant advantages that other comparable products simply don't have. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1350000,  which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price and understand the unique value of your product. However, I still feel we can find a more mutually beneficial price point. I can increase my offer to $1310000, which represents a significant investment and a fair value for both parties. This is substantially higher than my initial offer and demonstrates my serious interest in closing this deal. Would you consider this proposal?",1310000.0,Bob,4,
