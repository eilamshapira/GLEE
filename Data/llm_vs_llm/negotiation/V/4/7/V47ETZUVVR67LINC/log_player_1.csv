Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, I believe your asking price is a bit high. Given market conditions and comparable products, I would like to propose $1275000. This represents a fair value that would make this deal beneficial for both of us. I look forward to your response.

This is substantially higher than my initial offer and demonstrates my serious interest in closing this deal. Would you consider this proposal?
