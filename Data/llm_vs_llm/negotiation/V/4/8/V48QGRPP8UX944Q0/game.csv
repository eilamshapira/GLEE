,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $50. Let me know if we can work something out!",50.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $50 is too low for me to sell the product. I'm willing to come down to $180. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the lowest I can go is $170. This is a really good deal for a product of this quality. Let me know if this works for you!",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $170, but it's still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your current offer. How about $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to find a middle ground, but $110 is still below my minimum. I can go down to $160, which is a significant discount. Let me know if this works for you!",160.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to reach an agreement. The best I can do is $155. This is my final offer before considering other buyers. Let me know if you can accept this price!",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still above my budget. Considering it's your 'final' offer, I'm willing to make a serious counteroffer. I'll meet you at $130, which is the highest I'm comfortable paying. If we can't agree, I'll have to explore other options.",130.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $130 is still below what I can accept. I have another buyer willing to purchase at $150, so I'll need to consider that offer if we can't reach an agreement. My final offer to you is $150. Let me know if you can meet this price!",150.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're close, but I really can't go below $150. This is the best price I can offer, and it matches what another buyer is willing to pay. Let me know if you can accept this, or I'll have to consider the other offer.",150.0,Alice,7,
