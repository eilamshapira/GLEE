"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and your interest in the product. While $8500 is a bit low considering the product's value, I can come down from my initial price. I can offer it to you for $9000, which I believe is a fair compromise that would benefit both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
