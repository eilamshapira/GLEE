Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, there's still room for negotiation since the product is worth $10,000 to Bob. I'll try to meet somewhere in the middle with my next offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and your interest in the product. While $8,500 is a bit low considering the product's value, I can come down from my initial price. I can offer it to you for $9,000, which I believe is a fair compromise that would benefit both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
