"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. I believe it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for: 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum budget/value for the product is $1,200,000
2. John is offering it for $1,200,000 (this is my worst-case fallback)
3. Alice is offering it for $1,000,000, which is:
   - $200,000 less than John's price
   - Well below my maximum value
   - A seemingly reasonable first offer

While I could try to negotiate for an even lower price by making a counteroffer, Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000 is already a good deal compared to John's price, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation would yield a better outcome. I might even risk losing this good offer if I push too hard.

Therefore, I'll accept Alice's offer.
