Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that the product is worth $15,000 to me (as I can sell it to John for that price), and it's worth $8,000 to Bob, I'll start with a high but not unreasonable offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly below both the product's value to me ($15,000) and even below its value to him ($8,000). Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, and Bob's offer is far too low, there's no reason to continue negotiating.
