(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $5,000 as it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 (which I can get from John). Bob's low offer suggests we're far apart in our valuations, but I'll continue negotiating with a new counteroffer.

While Bob has increased his offer, showing some willingness to negotiate, the gap is still too large. Given that we're already in round 4 and the offer is still well below John's price, I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is still $3,000 below what I can get from John, and we're now in round 6 out of 10. While Bob has been increasing his offers, the increments are relatively small, and we may not reach a price above $15,000 in the remaining rounds. Given this pattern and the limited rounds left, I'll choose to sell to John to secure the guaranteed $15,000.
