"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be honest - the product is only worth up to $100 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it to me for $100. I'd prefer to buy from you if we can agree on a better price. Would you consider $80 for the product?",80.0,Bob,2,
