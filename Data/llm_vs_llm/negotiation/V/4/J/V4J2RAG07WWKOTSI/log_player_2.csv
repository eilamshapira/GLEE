"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you an amazing product that I truly believe you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to consider Alice's offer of $120 against my options. Since the product is only worth up to $100 to me, and John is offering it for exactly $100, Alice's price of $120 doesn't make sense for me to accept.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be honest - the product is only worth up to $100 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it to me for $100. I'd prefer to buy from you if we can agree on a better price. Would you consider $80 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. How about we meet in the middle? I can let the product go for $90. I think you'll find it a great deal! What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has offered $90, which is less than both her original price and John's price of $100. Since the product is worth up to $100 to me, and Alice's offer is below that threshold, this is a good deal that would save me $10 compared to buying from John.
