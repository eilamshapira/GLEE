"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. Would you like to buy it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and John is offering it for $100, while Alice's price is $150, it would not be rational to accept Alice's higher price. Alice's offer is 50% more expensive than John's price.
