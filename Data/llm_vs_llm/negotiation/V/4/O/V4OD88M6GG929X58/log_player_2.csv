"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer of $150 is higher than both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100), there's no reason to accept it. While I could make a counteroffer, I already know that John is willing to sell at $100, which is my maximum value. Therefore, the most logical decision is to buy from John.
