"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your initial price of $1400000 is below my maximum budget, I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial arrangement. Given the market value of similar products and considering a fair profit margin for you, I'd like to propose $950000 for the product. This represents a substantial profit over your valuation of $800000 while still giving me some value as well. I look forward to your response.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $950000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price.

This price reflects the product's worth and gives you a good deal, while also ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. I'm open to further negotiations and look forward to your response.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. That shows we're making progress, but I still feel we're quite far apart. I understand you want a good return on your investment, and I respect that. However, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints as well. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1050000, which would provide you with a substantial profit of $250000 over your valuation. This represents a fair middle ground that benefits us both. I hope we can find an agreement that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $1050000. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid and find a mutually beneficial price. However, I still believe the product is worth more to you than your current offer. Considering your budget and the product's value, I'd like to propose a price of $1275000. This price reflects a compromise between my initial ask and your previous offers, while also ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement at this price, and I look forward to your response.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for lowering your price to $1275000. I can see we're both working toward finding common ground. I appreciate the reduction, but I believe we can still find a price that better balances both our interests. I'm prepared to offer $1150000 for the product. This represents a significant increase from my last offer and would provide you with a very healthy profit of $350000 over your valuation. This seems like a fair compromise that acknowledges both the product's value to me and provides you with an excellent return. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
