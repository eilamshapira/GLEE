Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your initial price of $1400000 is below my maximum budget, I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial arrangement. Given the market value of similar products and considering a fair profit margin for you, I'd like to propose $950000 for the product. This represents a substantial profit over your valuation of $800000 while still giving me some value as well. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

I reject Bob's offer of $950,000 because I believe the product is worth more to him, and I can potentially get a better price. I'd like to counteroffer and see if we can meet at a higher price. 

My counteroffer is: $1,300,000. This price is still below Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. That shows we're making progress, but I still feel we're quite far apart. I understand you want a good return on your investment, and I respect that. However, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints as well. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1050000, which would provide you with a substantial profit of $250000 over your valuation. This represents a fair middle ground that benefits us both. I hope we can find an agreement that works for both of us.

My next step is to make a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my previous one, to show that I am willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. 

My counteroffer is: $1,275,000. This price is still below Bob's budget, and I believe it is a fair price considering the product's value to him."
