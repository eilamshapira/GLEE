Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $12,000 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($10,000) but lower than what I initially offered ($14,000), and considering the product's value to Bob is $15,000, I believe there's room for negotiation to get closer to my initial offer or at least ensure I get a good deal.

Given that I have 8 more rounds to negotiate and the goal is to earn as much money as possible, I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer that is lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's counteroffer, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle or closer to my favor.

My decision for Round 2 is to reject Bob's offer and proceed with a counteroffer.

My counteroffer for Round 3 would be $13,500."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to my previous counteroffer of $13,500. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, I believe he is still willing to pay more. However, I also need to consider that I have 6 more rounds to negotiate and the risk of not reaching an agreement.

Given that Bob's offer is very close to my previous counteroffer and it's a significant improvement from his initial offer, I'm inclined to accept this offer as it's a good compromise and ensures I earn a substantial amount for the product.

My decision for Round 4 is to accept Bob's offer.
