Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I believe it's a fair price, considering I can also buy it from John for $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your new offer, so how about $102.50? This is really close to the price I can get it from John, and I'd rather buy it from you if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
