"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe could be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you at a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know if you have any questions! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay $12,000."
