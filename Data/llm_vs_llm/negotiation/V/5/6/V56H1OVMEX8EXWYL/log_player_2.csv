"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for a competitive price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is less than your maximum price, there's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject this initial offer. You're willing to buy from John for $120, so you have some room to negotiate."
