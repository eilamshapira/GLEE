"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer of $300 is way above my maximum value of $80. It's better to reject and make a counteroffer in the next round. Even if negotiations fail, I can always buy from John for $80, which is my maximum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 50}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $50. Since my maximum value is $80 and I can always buy from John at $80, I'll start lower to leave room for negotiation. This gives me space to increase my offer if needed while still potentially getting a better deal than John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $275. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $275
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $275 is still significantly above my maximum value of $80. While she did reduce the price from $300, it's still not close to an acceptable range. I'll reject and make another counteroffer. I can always fall back on John's offer of $80 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 60}

I'll increase my offer slightly to $60. This shows some willingness to negotiate while still staying well below my maximum value of $80. Since Alice came down from $300 to $275, showing some flexibility on my side might encourage further negotiation, but I'm still maintaining a good buffer below John's price of $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, it's clear that Alice's pricing expectations are far above my maximum value of $80. Although she has reduced her price from $300 to $250, she's still asking more than three times my maximum value. Given that we're halfway through our negotiation rounds and the gap is still very large, it's unlikely we'll reach an agreement near my target price. The best decision is to take John's offer of $80, which is exactly at my maximum value and is clearly much better than Alice's current offer."
