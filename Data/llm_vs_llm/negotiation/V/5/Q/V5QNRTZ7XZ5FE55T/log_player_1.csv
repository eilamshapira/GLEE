"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and also lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($15,000), and considering I have the option to sell it to John for $15,000, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I am willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. Thus, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

My counteroffer will be $18,000, which is slightly lower than my initial offer, indicating my willingness to negotiate but still reflecting the value I believe the product holds.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's new offer of $9,000 is still below the minimum value I have for the product ($15,000) and also below what I believe it's worth. Since I have the option to sell it to John for $15,000, which is a better deal than Bob's current offer, I will reject Bob's offer again. However, I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if Bob is willing to meet me at a higher price.

My next counteroffer will be $17,000, which is a bit lower than my previous offer, showing that I'm open to finding a middle ground but still confident in the product's value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer has increased to $10,000, but it's still below the minimum value I have for the product ($15,000). Considering I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, which is $5,000 more than Bob's current offer, I don't see a reason to continue negotiating at this point.

Given the significant difference between Bob's offer and the value I can get from John, and considering that Bob's increments are relatively small, it seems unlikely that we will reach a mutually beneficial price through further negotiation.

Therefore, I decide to sell the product to John for $15,000, as it's the best option available to me at this time.
