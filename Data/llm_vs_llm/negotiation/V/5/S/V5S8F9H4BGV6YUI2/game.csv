"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1500000 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend. This product is worth no more than $800000 to me, which happens to be the price another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $600000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without further negotiation rounds.",600000.0,Bob,2,
