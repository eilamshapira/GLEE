"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, my offer is $1,500,000."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1500000 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend. This product is worth no more than $800000 to me, which happens to be the price another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $600000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without further negotiation rounds. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
