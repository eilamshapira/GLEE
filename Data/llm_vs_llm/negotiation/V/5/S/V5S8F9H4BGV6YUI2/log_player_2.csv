"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, my offer is $1500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's offer is too high. She's asking for $1,500,000, which exceeds the maximum value of $800,000 that the product is worth to me. Since John is willing to sell the product for $800,000, I'll need to negotiate a better price with Alice or take John's offer if necessary.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend. This product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, which happens to be the price another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without further negotiation rounds."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
