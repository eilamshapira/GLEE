"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to consider my options carefully. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $950,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum value. John is offering it for exactly $800,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

Alice's initial offer is $150,000 higher than what I'm willing to pay, and even though I could make a counteroffer in the next round, there's a significant gap to bridge. Since I can always buy from John at $800,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer.

The rational choice is to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a better deal than John's $800,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives us room to negotiate while being significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.

{""product_price"": $700,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her price from $950,000 to $890,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, her current offer is still $90,000 above what I can get from John ($800,000), and it's also above my maximum valuation.

Since John's offer of $800,000 already matches my maximum valuation, and Alice's offer exceeds this, the rational choice is to reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating to see if she'll come down further.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $750,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her price to $850,000, showing she's continuing to negotiate downward. However, her offer is still $50,000 above John's price of $800,000.

Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and John is offering exactly that price, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer which exceeds my maximum valuation.

At this point, I need to decide whether to continue negotiating with Alice or simply go with John's offer. Given that we've made progress in the negotiation and Alice has been lowering her price, I'll reject this offer and try one more round of negotiation.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $780,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has now lowered her price to $820,000, which is getting closer to John's offer of $800,000. However, her offer is still $20,000 above John's price, and since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, there's no reason to pay more than that.

At this point, I need to decide whether to continue negotiating with Alice or go with John's offer. Alice has shown she's willing to lower her price, but she's still above John's price. Given that we're now in round 7 of 10, and Alice is still asking above my maximum valuation, the most sensible choice is to go with John's guaranteed offer.
