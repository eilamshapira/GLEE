"Hello Alice, thanks for presenting your product. While it sounds interesting, that price is significantly higher than I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $5000. Let me know if that works for you.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $5000 is significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. The product has exceptional features and durability that justify a premium price point. While I understand budget constraints, I can come down to $20000, which represents a $2500 reduction from my initial offer. This is still an excellent value considering the product's quality and capabilities.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $20000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $7000, but that's my limit.  This offer reflects the value I place on the product, considering my budget and alternative options.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you have budget constraints, but I need to be transparent that my absolute minimum price is $15000, which represents the product's base value to me. I've seen significant interest in this product at higher price points, and I currently have another buyer, John, who is willing to purchase at $15000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can offer $17500, which is a substantial reduction from my previous offers. This price reflects both the true value of the product and my willingness to find a middle ground with you.",17500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for explaining your position.  While I believe your product is good, the mention of another buyer doesn't change my valuation.  I can go up to $7500, but that's truly my final offer. If that doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options for this type of product.",7500.0,Bob,6,
