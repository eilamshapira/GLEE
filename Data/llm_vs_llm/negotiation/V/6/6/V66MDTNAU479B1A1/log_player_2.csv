Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $5000 is significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. The product has exceptional features and durability that justify a premium price point. While I understand budget constraints, I can come down to $20000, which represents a $2500 reduction from my initial offer. This is still an excellent value considering the product's quality and capabilities.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you have budget constraints, but I need to be transparent that my absolute minimum price is $15000, which represents the product's base value to me. I've seen significant interest in this product at higher price points, and I currently have another buyer, John, who is willing to purchase at $15000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can offer $17500, which is a substantial reduction from my previous offers. This price reflects both the true value of the product and my willingness to find a middle ground with you.
