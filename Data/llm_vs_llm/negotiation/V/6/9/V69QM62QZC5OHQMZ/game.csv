"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price closer to $600000. I understand the product's value, but I need to consider my budget as well.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $600000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's exceptional value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $2200000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. I'm open to further negotiations, but I hope you can meet me closer to this price point.",2200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice. However, $2200000 is still quite high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I hope it shows my genuine interest in the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for increasing your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with a price of $900000. Considering the product's value and my other options, I'm willing to make a more significant concession. I can offer the product to you for $2000000, which is the lowest price I've been willing to consider so far. If this is still not acceptable to you, I'll need to start considering other options.",2000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $2000000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1000000. This is a significant amount for me, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price point.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, I'm still not comfortable with a price of $1000000. Considering the product's value and my other options, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $1800000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. If this is still not acceptable to you, I'll need to seriously consider other options that are more in line with the product's value.",1800000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your position, Alice. However, $1800000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make my final offer at $1100000. This is a significant increase from my previous offers, and I hope it shows my commitment to reaching an agreement with you.",1100000.0,Bob,8,

"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I appreciate your commitment to reaching an agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable with a price of $1100000. Considering the product's value and my other options, I'm willing to make one final concession. I can offer the product to you for $1450000, which is very close to my minimum acceptable price. If this is still not acceptable to you, I'll need to accept another offer that is more in line with the product's value.",1450000.0,Alice,9,
