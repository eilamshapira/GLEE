Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $2,500,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price closer to $600000. I understand the product's value, but I need to consider my budget as well. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate and try to reach a better price. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed option, but I want to explore the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's exceptional value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $2,200,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. I'm open to further negotiations, but I hope you can meet me closer to this price point."", ""product_price"": 2200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. However, $2200000 is still quite high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I hope it shows my genuine interest in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Although Bob has increased his offer to $900,000, it's still lower than what I'm willing to accept. Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than that. I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer, trying to get closer to a price that's acceptable to me. If Bob is not willing to meet me at a higher price point, I can always fall back on John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for increasing your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with a price of $900,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $2000000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1000000. This is a significant amount for me, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price point.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer, trying to get closer to a price that's acceptable to me.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, $1800000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make my final offer at $1100000. This is a significant increase from my previous offers, and I hope it shows my commitment to reaching an agreement with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Although Bob has increased his offer to $1,100,000, it's still $400,000 less than what John is willing to pay. Since Bob has stated that this is his final offer, I don't think he's willing to go much higher. Given the significant difference between Bob's offer and John's offer, I'm inclined to reject Bob's offer and consider selling to John. However, I'll give Bob one more chance to reconsider, and I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to John's price. If Bob still rejects, I'll likely sell to John."
