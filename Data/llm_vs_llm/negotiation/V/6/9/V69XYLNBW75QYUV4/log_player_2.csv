"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $150
2. My maximum value for the product is $150
3. John's fixed price is also $150
4. There are still 9 rounds left for negotiation with Alice

Since Alice's initial offer equals my maximum value and equals John's price, there's no advantage in accepting it immediately. I should try to negotiate for a better price with Alice, as I have nothing to lose - I can always fall back to John's offer of $150 if needed.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since this is my first counteroffer, I'll start significantly lower to leave room for negotiation. A reasonable starting point would be around 60% of the maximum price.

{""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has reduced her price by $10 from her initial offer, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This new price ($140) is better than John's fixed price ($150), but since we still have 7 rounds left for negotiation, I should try to get an even better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice came down $10 from her initial offer, so I'll increase my previous offer by a reasonable amount to show I'm willing to negotiate but still trying to get a good deal. I'll increase my previous offer of $90 by $15.

{""product_price"": 105}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has shown a good faith negotiation pattern by reducing her price from $150 to $140 to $130. This is already a significant $20 savings compared to John's price. However, since we still have 5 rounds left and Alice has demonstrated willingness to reduce the price, I'll try one more round of negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has been consistently dropping her price ($150 -> $140 -> $130), and I've moved up from $90 -> $105, I'll make a more substantial increase to try to meet closer to the middle. Her last offer was $130, and my last offer was $105, so I'll aim for a point that shows significant movement from my side.
