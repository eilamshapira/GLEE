"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your insights, I'm initially proposing a price of $1350000. This is a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it's a worthwhile investment for you. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential, $1350000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. Would you consider $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900000 is too significant a gap from what I know this product is worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1125000? I'm confident that at this price point, it's a win-win for both of us.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. $1125000 is still a little rich for my blood. My maximum is really around $1000000. Would you consider that?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
