"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have something I think you'll be very interested in. Given its value to you, I'm offering it for $11500. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $11,500 is less than that, it's a good deal. However, I want to save as much money as I can. 

Considering Alice's offer is close to the maximum I'm willing to pay, and buying from John would cost me $12,000, I should try to negotiate or reject the offer to see if Alice can give me a better price. But since the difference between Alice's offer and John's price is only $500, and I don't have any information that Alice would be willing to lower the price, I should consider accepting the offer to avoid the risk of having to pay $12,000 to John.
