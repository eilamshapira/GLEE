"Hello Bob, I'm glad you're interested in the product. Given its high value and uniqueness, I'm offering it to you for $1200000. I believe this price reflects its worth and I'm open to negotiations.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I should mention that I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $1000000. Since I know the product is worth $1000000 to you as well, I'd like to propose a fair deal at $900000. This allows you to make a reasonable profit while giving me some savings compared to my alternative option. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you have an alternative option, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. Considering the product's value to both of us, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll offer it to you for $1050000, which is still a better deal than what John is offering you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but I need to be clear that I have a guaranteed option to purchase this product from John for $1000000. For me to choose you over John, I would need a better price. I'm willing to offer $950000, which allows you to make a reasonable profit while giving me an incentive to buy from you rather than John. This creates a win-win situation for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. I understand that you have a guaranteed option with John, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between your current offer and the price you'd pay to John. I'll offer the product to you for $975000. This way, you'll still get a better deal than what I initially offered, and I'll get a fair price for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",975000.0,Alice,5,
