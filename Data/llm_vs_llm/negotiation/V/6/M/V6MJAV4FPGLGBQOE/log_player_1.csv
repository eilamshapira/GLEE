"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm glad you're interested in the product. Given its high value and uniqueness, I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this price reflects its worth and I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I should mention that I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $1000000. Since I know the product is worth $1000000 to you as well, I'd like to propose a fair deal at $900000. This allows you to make a reasonable profit while giving me some savings compared to my alternative option. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, as I believe I can negotiate a better price than $900,000, considering the product's worth to both of us is $1,000,000. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a good backup option, but I'll try to get a better deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you have an alternative option, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to both of us, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000, which is still a better deal than what John is offering you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but I need to be clear that I have a guaranteed option to purchase this product from John for $1000000. For me to choose you over John, I would need a better price. I'm willing to offer $950000, which allows you to make a reasonable profit while giving me an incentive to buy from you rather than John. This creates a win-win situation for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make another counteroffer to Bob in the next round. While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to the product's value, I still believe I can negotiate a better price. Since Bob is willing to pay up to $1,000,000 to John, I'll try to meet him in the middle between his current offer and the price he's willing to pay to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. I understand that you have a guaranteed option with John, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between your current offer and the price you'd pay to John. I'll offer the product to you for $975,000. This way, you'll still get a better deal than what I initially offered, and I'll get a fair price for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable to you."", ""product_price"": 975000}"
