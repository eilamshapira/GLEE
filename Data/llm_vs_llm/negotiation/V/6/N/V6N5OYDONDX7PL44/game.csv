"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I can't go as high as $14000. I know that John is selling the same product for $12000, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a better deal. I'm willing to offer $10000 for the product. This would save me some money compared to John's price, and still give you a reasonable deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer. I understand you're looking for a better deal than John's price. How about we meet halfway? I can offer you the product for $13000. This way, you save some money compared to my initial offer, and I feel comfortable with the value. Let me know if this works for you!",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your $13000 offer is better, but I still need to be practical about this purchase. John is offering the exact same product for $12000, which is already at the maximum of what this product is worth to me. To make it worthwhile to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer $11000, which would save me $1000 compared to John's price while still giving you a reasonable return. Does that work for you?",11000.0,Bob,4,
