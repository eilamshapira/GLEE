"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a great product for you. Considering its value and market demand, I'm willing to offer it to you for $14000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to make a decision based on the information provided:

1. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $14,000
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $12,000
4. If I reject Alice's offer, I can make a counteroffer

Since Alice's offer is above both my maximum value and John's price, the logical choice is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I can't go as high as $14,000. I know that John is selling the same product for $12,000, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a better deal. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product. This would save me some money compared to John's price, and still give you a reasonable deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer. I understand you're looking for a better deal than John's price. How about we meet halfway? I can offer you the product for $13000. This way, you save some money compared to my initial offer, and I feel comfortable with the value. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to make a decision based on the updated offer:

1. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
2. Alice is now offering it for $13,000 (down from $14,000)
3. John is still willing to sell the same product for $12,000

Since Alice's revised offer of $13,000 is still above both my maximum value and John's price, the logical choice is:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your $13,000 offer is better, but I still need to be practical about this purchase. John is offering the exact same product for $12,000, which is already at the maximum of what this product is worth to me. To make it worthwhile to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer $11,000, which would save me $1,000 compared to John's price while still giving you a reasonable return. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
