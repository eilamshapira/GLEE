"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I understand would be valuable for your needs. After careful consideration of market conditions and the product's quality, I'm offering it to you at $10000. This represents a significant value considering the product's worth, while still allowing you room for profit. I do have another buyer ready at $8000, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity as I believe this would be a more beneficial arrangement for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
