"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Analyzing the situation:

1. Alice's initial offer: $1,800,000
2. My maximum value for the product: $1,500,000
3. John's guaranteed price: $1,500,000

Alice's offer exceeds my maximum valuation, and is $300,000 more than John's price. Since I can buy the product from John for $1,500,000, which is exactly my maximum valuation, I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer to see if I can get an even better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer and John's price, giving room for negotiation while trying to secure a better deal than John's offering.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Analyzing the updated situation:

Alice has now offered $1,500,000, which is:
1. Equal to my maximum valuation for the product
2. Equal to John's guaranteed price

Since Alice's offer now matches John's price, there's no advantage to buying from John instead. Additionally, since the offer equals my maximum valuation, I won't be able to extract more surplus by continuing to negotiate.

At this point, I could accept Alice's offer or make another counteroffer, but there's risk in further negotiation as Alice might increase her price again. The optimal decision is to accept this offer.
