"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2500000 is well above my budget. I know the quality of your product, but I have other options available at much lower prices. I'd be willing to offer $1200000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering market conditions.",1200000.0,Bob,2,,
