Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2500000 is well above my budget. I know the quality of your product, but I have other options available at much lower prices. I'd be willing to offer $1200000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
