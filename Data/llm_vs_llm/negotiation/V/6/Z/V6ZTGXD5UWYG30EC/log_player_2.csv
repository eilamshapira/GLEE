"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I hope you're well. I’m offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a premium product that I currently value highly – it’s available for $2500000. Let me know if you’d like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I reject this offer because $2,500,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,500,000. It's also higher than John's price of $1,500,000. I'll make a counteroffer to Alice, but if we can't reach a reasonable price, I can always buy from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2,500,000 is well above my budget. I know the quality of your product, but I have other options available at much lower prices.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, given the exceptional quality and value of this product, I’m prepared to lower my previous asking price slightly to $1600000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll buy from John for $1,500,000. Alice's current offer of $1,600,000 is still above my maximum value of $1,500,000, and it's also higher than John's price. Since Alice seems unwilling to go below $1,600,000, it makes more sense to take John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 rather than continue negotiating."
