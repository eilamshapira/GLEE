You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer matches your maximum budget, there's a chance to negotiate a lower price. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower before settling for the $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer (around 66% of Alice's initial price) allows room for negotiation while still leaving a good chance of securing a price well below $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice reducing her price significantly suggests she's willing to negotiate. We're already saving $2000 compared to John's offer, but there's still room to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:** We're splitting the difference between our last offer ($8000) and her current price ($10,000). This shows we're willing to move closer to her price but still want a significant discount."
