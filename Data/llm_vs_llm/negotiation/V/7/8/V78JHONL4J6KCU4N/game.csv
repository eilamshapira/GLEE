"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer the product for $13000. Let me know if this works for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $13000 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  Could you do $9500? That would be a great price for me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see where you're coming from, but I need to stay above my minimum price. How about we settle at $12500? This is a fair price and still a good deal for you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget limit. How about $10500? That's my final offer.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I need to stay close to my minimum value. How about we agree on $12200? This is as low as I can go while still making the deal work for me.",12200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really close. I can do $11000, but that's absolutely as high as I can go.  It's a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I really can't go below $12000. How about we settle at $12000? This is my final offer, and it matches the value I need to get from the product.",12000.0,Alice,9,
