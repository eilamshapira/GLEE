"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice's opening offer is the maximum I'm willing to pay. There's no reason to accept it outright. I should make a counteroffer significantly lower and see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000?"", ""product_price"": 8000} 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer allows room for negotiation. This counteroffer tests Alice's willingness to come down on her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer the product for $13000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** While Alice came down in price, it's not a significant drop. There's still room for negotiation.  I'll counter with a price closer to my target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $13,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  Could you do $9,500? That would be a great price for me."", ""product_price"": 9500}

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer shows Alice I'm willing to move closer to her price but still leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see where you're coming from, but I need to stay above my minimum price. How about we settle at $12500? This is a fair price and still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving slowly, but I still think there's room for her to come down further. I'm willing to push a little more since I have time before John's offer becomes the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget limit. How about $10,500? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 10500}

**Reasoning:** This is a strategic decision point. I'm presenting this as my ""final offer"" to put some pressure on Alice, but I'm still leaving a little room for her to counter. Ideally, this gets her closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I need to stay close to my minimum value. How about we agree on $12200? This is as low as I can go while still making the deal work for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to hold firm, but this counteroffer shows she's willing to budge slightly. I'll make one more push to see if I can close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you're really close. I can do $11,000, but that's absolutely as high as I can go.  It's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000} 

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show good faith and put the pressure back on Alice. This is a strong offer, and her response will tell me whether she's truly willing to negotiate further or if I should consider John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I really can't go below $12000. How about we settle at $12000? This is my final offer, and it matches the value I need to get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice seems firm at $12,000, and with only one round left, it's unlikely I'll get a better price from her. This offer saves me $3,000 compared to John's, which is a significant saving. It's time to close the deal."
