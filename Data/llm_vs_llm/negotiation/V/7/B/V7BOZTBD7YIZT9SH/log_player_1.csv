"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000.  This gives us room to negotiate and still achieve a price I'm happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's below my minimum acceptable value. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer but still well above Bob's offer.  I hope this is a more reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I will counteroffer again."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}

I'm offering the product for $1,500,000, which is my absolute minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will finally agree to this price."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer, I'm running out of time and I'm not confident we'll reach an agreement.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the best option at this point."
