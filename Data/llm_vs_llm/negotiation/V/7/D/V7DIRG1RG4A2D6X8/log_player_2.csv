"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $8000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is above my budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,500?"",

}
``` 
I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much room there is for negotiation. $6,500 is still a decent price and would save me a good amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $6500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $7500.  That's still a good deal for you, considering the product is worth $8000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and propose something between our last two prices."

""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?"",

This counter-offer shows Alice I'm willing to compromise and move closer to her price, but I'm still aiming for a price that's beneficial for me."
