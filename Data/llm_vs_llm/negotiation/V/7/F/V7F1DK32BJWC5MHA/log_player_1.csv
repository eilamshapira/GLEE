Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2,500,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth to me. I'm open to further negotiations if needed. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and even lower than what John is willing to pay, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I still have the option to sell to John if negotiations with Bob don't improve.

Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $2,200,000. This price is still lower than my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value. I'm open to further negotiations if needed."", ""product_price"": 2200000}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the reduction in price, but $2200000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $1050000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise. I'm open to further negotiations if needed. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Since Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still lower than what John is willing to pay, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. However, I will take into account that Bob is increasing his offer, which shows that he is willing to negotiate.

Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the significant reduction in price. However, $1800000 is still above my budget.

Since Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still lower than what John is willing to pay, I will reject Bob's offer. However, I notice that Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget, and I'm not sure if he can go much higher. Considering this, I will make a counteroffer that is closer to John's offer, but still slightly higher.

Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to make another reduction in price.
