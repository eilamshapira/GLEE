"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1600000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I must say that $1600000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I already have an alternative option to purchase it at that price from John. However, I value potentially working with you, so I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product. This gives you a chance to make the sale today rather than having me go with my alternative option.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. However,  $900000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and the benefits it offers.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and counter at $1250000.  This represents a fair deal for both of us, ensuring you acquire a valuable asset while reflecting the value I'm providing.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for coming down on your price, but $1250000 is still above what makes economic sense for me. As I mentioned, this product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I have John's offer at exactly that price. To make it worth choosing you over John, I need to save money, not spend more. I can offer you $950000, which gives you a quick sale today rather than no sale at all. Remember, if we can't reach an agreement that works for me financially, I'll simply purchase from John at $1000000.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need you to understand mine as well. Accepting an offer significantly below its value isn't feasible for me. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1150000. This reflects my flexibility while ensuring we both benefit from this deal. I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's value and potential.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate and lowering your price, but I need to be clear about my situation. The product is worth $1000000 to me - that's my absolute ceiling. John is offering it at exactly that price. For me to choose you over John, I would need to pay less than $1000000, not more. I understand you value the product at $1200000, so I'm willing to offer you $975000, which is my final offer. This allows you to make a sale today, albeit at a loss compared to your valuation, rather than losing the sale completely when I go with John's offer. Please consider this carefully - I can't justify paying more than what the product is worth to me.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I respect your honesty about your budget limitations. I've tried to find a middle ground here, but it seems we're at an impasse. I'm not willing to go as low as $975000. However, I'm open to one final offer. If you can agree to $1050000, we have a deal. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's more than fair considering the product's intrinsic value and potential for you. This is my final offer, Bob.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
