Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I must say that $1600000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I already have an alternative option to purchase it at that price from John. However, I value potentially working with you, so I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product. This gives you a chance to make the sale today rather than having me go with my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm willing to meet you halfway and counter at $1,250,000.  This represents a fair deal for both of us, ensuring you acquire a valuable asset while reflecting the value I'm providing."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for coming down on your price, but $1250000 is still above what makes economic sense for me. As I mentioned, this product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I have John's offer at exactly that price. To make it worth choosing you over John, I need to save money, not spend more. I can offer you $950000, which gives you a quick sale today rather than no sale at all. Remember, if we can't reach an agreement that works for me financially, I'll simply purchase from John at $1000000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need you to understand mine as well. Accepting an offer significantly below its value isn't feasible for me. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects my flexibility while ensuring we both benefit from this deal. I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's value and potential."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate and lowering your price, but I need to be clear about my situation. The product is worth $1000000 to me - that's my absolute ceiling. John is offering it at exactly that price. For me to choose you over John, I would need to pay less than $1000000, not more. I understand you value the product at $1200000, so I'm willing to offer you $975000, which is my final offer. This allows you to make a sale today, albeit at a loss compared to your valuation, rather than losing the sale completely when I go with John's offer. Please consider this carefully - I can't justify paying more than what the product is worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

""message"": ""Bob, I respect your honesty about your budget limitations. I've tried to find a middle ground here, but it seems we're at an impasse. I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. However, I'm open to one final offer. If you can agree to $1,050,000, we have a deal. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's more than fair considering the product's intrinsic value and potential for you. This is my final offer, Bob."",
