"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me think about this:
1. Alice's offer is $95
2. The product is worth $80 to Alice (her cost)
3. The product is worth no more than $100 to me
4. John's price is $100 (my fallback option)

Alice's offer of $95 is less than John's price ($100), but there's still room for negotiation since Alice's cost is $80. I should reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price with Alice. Even if negotiations fail, I can still buy from John at $100.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's cost is $80 and she offered $95, I'll make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me but still gives Alice a reasonable profit. I'll propose a price of $85, which gives Alice a $5 profit while saving me money compared to both her initial offer and John's price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this new situation:
1. Alice has lowered her price from $95 to $90
2. This shows she's willing to negotiate and drop her price
3. $90 is still better than John's $100
4. While there might be room to negotiate further (since her cost is $80), pushing too hard might make her stick to a higher price or become unwilling to negotiate

The $90 offer is a reasonable compromise - it gives Alice a $10 profit while saving me $10 compared to buying from John. Given that negotiations could potentially break down if I push too hard, and this is already a good price, I should accept this offer.
