"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this is a fair price that allows me to get a good return as well.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $14,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell.  Rejecting her offer might lead to a better counter-offer."
