"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a fair price.  My initial offer is $1450000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I was hoping for a more favorable price. How about we settle on $1300000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1300000 is simply too low for me to consider at this time.  I'm confident this product is worth more than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $1400000? This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a fair value.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1250000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle again at $1350000?  This would be a fair price, considering the value I'm putting on this product.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  While $1300000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference one more time and see if we can reach an agreement.  I'm willing to come down to $1325000.  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
