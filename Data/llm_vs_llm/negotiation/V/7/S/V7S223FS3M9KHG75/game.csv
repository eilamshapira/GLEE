"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $900000 is too low considering the product's value. I can offer it for $1100000, which would still give you a significant profit margin of $400000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving up in price, Bob. To demonstrate my willingness to reach an agreement, I can reduce my price to $1050000. This still provides you with an excellent $450000 profit margin while being fair to both parties.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
