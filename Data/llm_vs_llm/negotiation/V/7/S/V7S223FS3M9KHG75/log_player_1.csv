Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its high quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,300,000. This price reflects the product's true worth while still leaving room for profitable returns on your end."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I believe the product's value is closer to $800000, considering its value to you. I am willing to offer $900000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. Bob's offer of $900,000 is too close to my minimum value of $800,000, and I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to him. Let me propose a more reasonable price that still gives him substantial profit margin.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $900,000 is too low considering the product's value. I can offer it for $1,100,000, which would still give you a significant profit margin of $400,000."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you, Alice. I understand your perspective. However, I'm still looking to maximize my return on investment. Would you consider a price of $1000000?

I'll make another counteroffer. While Bob's offer has improved, there's still room for negotiation given that the product is worth $1.5M to him. I'll try to meet somewhere in the middle between his $1M and my previous $1.1M offer.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you moving up in price, Bob. To demonstrate my willingness to reach an agreement, I can reduce my price to $1,050,000. This still provides you with an excellent $450,000 profit margin while being fair to both parties."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
