Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. Since I know I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, I can be somewhat aggressive in my pricing to Bob. While I don't want to price it so high that Bob will definitely reject it, I also want to maximize my potential profit. I'll set a price that's significantly higher than my guaranteed alternative but not unreasonably high.
