Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider the situation strategically. Since the product is worth $15,000 to me, I should not sell below this price. Bob values the product at $12,000, which is less than my minimum acceptable value. If Bob rejects my offer, I can sell to John for $15,000 guaranteed.

Given these circumstances, there's no benefit for me to offer Bob a price below $15,000, since he won't accept anything above his valuation of $12,000, and I already have a better alternative with John.
