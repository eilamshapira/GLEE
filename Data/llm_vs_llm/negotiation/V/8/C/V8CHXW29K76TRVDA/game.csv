"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $2000000 is far beyond my budget. I value the product at significantly less. I'm willing to offer $600000. Please let me know if that's something you'd consider.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $600000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to accept $1200000 for the product. This price reflects a considerable reduction from my original asking price, yet still ensures I receive a fair value for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
