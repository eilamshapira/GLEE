Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a reasonably high offer to leave room for potential negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is quite reasonable and significantly better than John's guaranteed $800,000. While it's lower than my initial offer, it still provides a good profit margin and eliminates the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a less favorable outcome.
