Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a quicker sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 is a significant profit for me (still well above my minimum) while offering Bob a discount from what he perceives as the product's worth. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By mentioning other interested parties and a ""limited-time offer,"" I create a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly."
