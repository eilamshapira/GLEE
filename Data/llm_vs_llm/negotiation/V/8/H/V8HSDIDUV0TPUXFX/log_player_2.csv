"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a premium product that I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm offering you this product for $15000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer of $15,000 is higher than the product's worth to me ($10,000) and higher than John's offer ($10,000), it would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. John's price is exactly at my maximum value, and while it's not ideal, it's better than paying $15,000.
