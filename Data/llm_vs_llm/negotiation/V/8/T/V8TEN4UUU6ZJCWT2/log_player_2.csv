"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's asking for $18,000, but I know the product is only worth $15,000 to me at maximum. John is offering the exact same product for $15,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since Alice's offer exceeds my maximum valuation, and an alternative seller is available at my maximum acceptable price, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer. I could try to negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, but I already have a guaranteed option at $15,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice that provides a reasonable discount from her initial offer while still being potentially attractive compared to my alternative option.

{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has lowered her price to $16,000, which is an improvement from her initial $18,000 offer. However, this is still $1,000 more than John's price of $15,000, and $1,000 more than my maximum valuation of $15,000.

Since I can still purchase the product from John at exactly my maximum valuation ($15,000), and Alice's offer still exceeds this amount, the logical choice is to reject Alice's offer and try one more counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has come down to $16,000 from her initial $18,000 offer, I'll make a more reasonable counteroffer that provides benefit to both of us compared to my alternative option.

{""product_price"": 13500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer is $15,500, which is getting closer but is still $500 more than John's price of $15,000. Since the product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed option to buy it at exactly $15,000 from John, there's no reason for me to pay more than that.

At this point, I'll make one final attempt to get Alice to meet the $15,000 price point.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a final reasonable counteroffer to Alice, matching John's price.
