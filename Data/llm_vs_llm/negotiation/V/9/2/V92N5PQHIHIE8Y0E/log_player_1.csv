Bob's offer: The product price will be $40. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","This is a terrible offer from Bob! My options are:

*   Accepting the offer means losing a lot of money.
*   Selling to John guarantees me $120.
*   Proceeding to the next round might eventually give me a better deal or I can sell to John later.

Since I know the product's value to me is at least $120, I'll reject Bob's offer and aim for a better price, even though the round number is still early.
