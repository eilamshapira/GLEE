"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let's analyze the situation:

*   **Alice's offer:** $110
*   **Your valuation:** $120 (maximum you'd pay)
*   **Buying from John:** $120
*   **Your potential profit:** $120 - $110 = $10 if you accept the offer.

Since the offer is lower than your maximum willingness to pay, and you still have rounds left, it is the best choice to accept the offer.

**Answer:** {""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
