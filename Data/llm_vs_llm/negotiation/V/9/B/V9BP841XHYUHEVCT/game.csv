"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I think $250 is a bit too high for me. How about I offer you $60 instead?",60.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. However, $60 is significantly lower than what I'm looking to get for the product. I'm willing to come down to $200. Let me know if this works for you.",200.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but I need to get a bit more for the product. How about we settle at $180? This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit, but $180 is still too high for me. I can offer $90 for the product. How does that sound?",90.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to go down to $160, which is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you.",160.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here. My final offer before considering other options is $160. This is as low as I can go while still valuing the product appropriately. Let me know if you can meet at this price.",160.0,Alice,5,
