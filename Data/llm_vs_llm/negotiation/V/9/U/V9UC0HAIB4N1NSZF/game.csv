"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $750000 is below my minimum acceptable price. The product's quality and market value justify a higher price point. However, I'm willing to adjust my initial asking price. I can offer it to you for $1050000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
