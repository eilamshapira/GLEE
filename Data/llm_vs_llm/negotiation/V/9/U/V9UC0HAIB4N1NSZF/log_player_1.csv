Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,200,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. However, the price is a bit higher than what I'm looking to spend. Considering my budget, I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since Bob's offer of $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 (which is what John is offering), but I still see potential for negotiation with Bob to reach a better price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. The product's quality and market value justify a higher price point. However, I'm willing to adjust my initial asking price. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
