# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I know would be a great fit for your needs. Given its high market value and unique features, I'm offering it to you for $950000. This represents excellent value considering the product's worth, while still allowing you room for profit. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price to avoid losing the sale."
