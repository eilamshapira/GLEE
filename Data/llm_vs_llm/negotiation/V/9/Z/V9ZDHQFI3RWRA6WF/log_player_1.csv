Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $120 to Bob
2. My minimum acceptable price is $80
3. I have a guaranteed fallback of $80 from John
4. Bob will accept if he sees value (price below $120)
5. The sweet spot is pricing high enough to maximize my profit while still giving Bob enough incentive to accept

I'll price it at $105. This:
- Gives me a good profit ($25 more than my fallback option)
- Gives Bob a $15 benefit ($120 - $105)
- Is high enough to maximize my profit but low enough to make it attractive to Bob
