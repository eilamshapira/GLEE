"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $5,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($15,000), I will reject his offer.

Also, selling to John for $15,000 is still an option, but I want to try to get a better price from Bob.

So, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that's still high, but slightly lower than my initial offer, to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle.

{""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $7,000 is still lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($15,000), but it's slightly better than his previous offer.

I'll reject his offer again, as I believe I can get a better price. Selling to John for $15,000 is still a safe option, but I'll try to negotiate with Bob a bit more.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make another counteroffer, trying to find a middle ground. Since Bob's last offer was $7,000, I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my previous counteroffer of $18,000.

{""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum value of $15,000, but it's still short.

At this point, I'm starting to think that Bob might not be willing to meet my minimum price. Since selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed deal, I'm inclined to take that option rather than risking further negotiation with Bob.
