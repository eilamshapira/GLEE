"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is twice the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($10,000), it's not a good deal for me. I'd like to try to negotiate a better price. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm willing to pay up to $10,000, I'll offer half of that amount to see how Alice responds.

{""product_price"": 5000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $18,000 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. While it's a slight improvement from her initial offer of $20,000, it's not enough to make me want to accept it.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Maybe I can get her to lower the price even more.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice rejected my previous offer of $5,000 and came back with a price of $18,000, I'll try to meet her halfway. I'll increase my offer, but still keep it below my maximum budget of $10,000.

{""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $12,500 is getting closer to my maximum budget of $10,000, but it's still above it. I'm not willing to pay more than $10,000 for the product, and buying it from John for $10,000 is starting to look like a more attractive option.

However, I'll try to negotiate one more time to see if Alice is willing to lower the price further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer is now $12,500, I'll try to split the difference between her offer and my maximum budget of $10,000. I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly above my previous offer, but still below Alice's current offer.
