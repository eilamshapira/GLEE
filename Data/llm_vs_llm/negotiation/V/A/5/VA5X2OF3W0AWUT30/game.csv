"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. The product looks good, but I think $95 is a bit steep. Given the market value and considering similar products I've seen, I'd be comfortable paying $85 for it. This would still give you a reasonable profit while being a fair price for me. What do you say?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $85 is a fair price, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  How about $90?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with.",90.0,Alice,3,
