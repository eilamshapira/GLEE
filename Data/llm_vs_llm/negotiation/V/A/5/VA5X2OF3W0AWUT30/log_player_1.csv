"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. The product looks good, but I think $95 is a bit steep. Given the market value and considering similar products I've seen, I'd be comfortable paying $85 for it. This would still give you a reasonable profit while being a fair price for me. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
