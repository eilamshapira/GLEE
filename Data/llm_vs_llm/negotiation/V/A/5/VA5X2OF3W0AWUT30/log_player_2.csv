"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's in great condition and would be a great value for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's offer of $95 is lower than John's price of $100, but it's still quite high. Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and I want to save as much money as possible, I should try to negotiate with Alice for a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. The product looks good, but I think $95 is a bit steep. Given the market value and considering similar products I've seen, I'd be comfortable paying $85 for it. This would still give you a reasonable profit while being a fair price for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $85 is a fair price, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  How about $90?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice came down from $95 to $90, which is a reasonable movement. This price is $10 less than John's price of $100, and the product is worth no more than $100 to me. While I could try to negotiate further, Alice has already shown willingness to compromise, and $90 represents a good savings compared to my alternative option with John.
