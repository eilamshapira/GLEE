"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Looking at the situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $120
2. The product is worth no more than $80 to me
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $80

Since Alice's offer ($120) exceeds the product's value to me ($80), and John is offering exactly what the product is worth to me, I should reject Alice's offer and buy from John.
