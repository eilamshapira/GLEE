Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a reasonable price to offer Bob that maximizes my potential profit while still being acceptable to him.

Since I know my minimum acceptable price is $12,000 (as I can always sell to John for this amount), I should offer Bob a price higher than this threshold.

Without knowing Bob's maximum willingness to pay, I'll need to make an educated guess. Setting the price too high risks rejection, while setting it too low leaves money on the table.

A reasonable approach is to offer a price that represents a meaningful premium over my minimum but isn't likely to be perceived as excessive.
