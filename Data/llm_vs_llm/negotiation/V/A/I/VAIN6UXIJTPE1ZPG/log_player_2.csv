"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I'm willing to let it go for $12000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $12,000
2. John is also selling it for $12,000
3. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
4. Both offers are exactly the same price

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($12,000), and this is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, there's no advantage to choosing one over the other. In this case, I might as well accept Alice's offer since she's already engaged in negotiations with me.
