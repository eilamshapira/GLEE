"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was looking to spend no more than $6000. Would you be open to negotiating the price down to this amount?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for getting back to me. I understand that you're looking to spend a specific amount. However, given the value and quality of our product, I'm afraid $6000 would be substantially less than what we can accept. I can, however, lower our initial offer to $18000. How does that sound?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate that. However, $18000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to go lower, perhaps to around $9000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
