"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since John's offer ($1,000,000) is lower than Alice's offer ($1,200,000) and matches my maximum valuation of the product ($1,000,000), I'll buy from John. This saves me $200,000 compared to Alice's offer."
