"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $100 is a bit high for me. I know this product is available elsewhere for $80. Would you be willing to sell it for $70? This would save me the trouble of going elsewhere and give you a quick sale.",70.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is below my minimum price. I can go as low as $85 for this product. Let me know if that works for you.",85.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
