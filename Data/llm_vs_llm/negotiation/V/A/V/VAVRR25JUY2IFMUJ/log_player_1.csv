Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $100 is a bit high for me. I know this product is available elsewhere for $80. Would you be willing to sell it for $70? This would save me the trouble of going elsewhere and give you a quick sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is below my minimum price. I can go as low as $85 for this product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $82. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 82}"
