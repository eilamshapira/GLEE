"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $100. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering the product for $100
2. The product is worth $80 to me
3. John is willing to sell it for $80
4. I should never pay more than $80 for this product

Since Alice's offer ($100) is above my maximum value ($80) and John is offering exactly $80, I could just buy from John. However, I might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice. Let me reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but still gives me room to negotiate:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $100 is a bit high for me. I know this product is available elsewhere for $80. Would you be willing to sell it for $70? This would save me the trouble of going elsewhere and give you a quick sale."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $82. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice has reduced her price from $100 to $82
2. John's price is $80
3. Alice's current offer ($82) is still above John's price ($80)
4. There's no reason to pay $82 when I can get it for $80 from John

Since Alice's offer is still above John's price, and I know I can get it for $80, I should just buy from John. There's no point in continuing the negotiation when I have a guaranteed better option.
