Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! The product seems great, but I was hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,000 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($8,000), but still lower than my initial offer, I'll choose to reject his offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer of $10,000 is getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since we're only at Round 4 and I have 6 more rounds to negotiate, I'll choose to reject his offer and make another counteroffer to try to get an even better price.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your latest offer and my previous counteroffer. How about we settle at $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks again for the offer. I'm willing to go up slightly, but I'm still trying to save some money. What about $10500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer of $10,500 is getting very close to a price that I'm comfortable with, and it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. Considering we're already at Round 6 and the negotiation is progressing, I think it's a good idea to accept his offer and close the deal. Rejecting his offer and making another counteroffer might risk him walking away or not being willing to increase his price further.
