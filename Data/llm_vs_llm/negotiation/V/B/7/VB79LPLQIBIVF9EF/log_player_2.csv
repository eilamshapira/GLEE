Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I think $12,500 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. How about we proceed with this price? I'm looking forward to your response."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $9000, I need to be closer to my target price. This product delivers significant value at $15000 market worth. I can come down to $11500, which represents a substantial discount while still reflecting the product's true value. This is a fair middle ground between our positions.

Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $11,500 is still higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm ready to raise my offer to $9,500. Let's meet halfway and close the deal at this price. What do you think?"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you raising your offer to $9500. We're making progress, but we're still not quite there. Given that this product is worth $15000 to you, I'm willing to come down further to $10800. This gives you over $4000 in value while still being fair to me. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that benefits us both.
