"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to make a decision based on the information provided. 

Alice is offering the product for $12,000.
John is also selling the product for $12,000.
The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me.

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($12,000), there's no financial advantage to choosing one over the other. However, I've been specifically instructed that if I reject Alice's offer, I will buy from John.
