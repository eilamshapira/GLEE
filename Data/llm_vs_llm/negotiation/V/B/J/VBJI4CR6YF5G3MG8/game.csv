"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1300000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. This price reflects my budget and allows for a fair profit margin for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the budget. However, given the product's exceptional value and market position, I believe we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm willing to adjust my initial price to $1150000. This represents a significant reduction from my original offer and provides excellent value considering the product's benefits and potential return on investment. Would this work better for you?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
