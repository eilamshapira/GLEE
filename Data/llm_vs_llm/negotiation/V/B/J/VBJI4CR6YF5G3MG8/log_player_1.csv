"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1300000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. This price reflects my budget and allows for a fair profit margin for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $1,000,000 as there's still room for negotiation. While it's above my minimum threshold of $800,000, it's significantly below the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000). I can make a counteroffer that's more appealing than selling to John while still capturing more value than Bob's current offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the budget. However, given the product's exceptional value and market position, I believe we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm willing to adjust my initial price to $1,150,000. This represents a significant reduction from my original offer and provides excellent value considering the product's benefits and potential return on investment. Would this work better for you?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
