# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the budget. However, given the product's exceptional value and market position, I believe we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm willing to adjust my initial price to $1150000. This represents a significant reduction from my original offer and provides excellent value considering the product's benefits and potential return on investment. Would this work better for you?
