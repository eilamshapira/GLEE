"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for a special price. Would you like to buy it for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer of $120 is less than my maximum budget of $150, it's a good deal for me. I don't want to risk losing this opportunity and having to pay more to John.
