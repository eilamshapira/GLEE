"Hello Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product. It's a serious offer considering my valuation.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $1000000 is too low for this product's value. I have other interested parties willing to pay significantly more. Given the product's quality and market value, I can lower my price to $1600000, which is a substantial reduction from my initial offer. Would you consider this more reasonable price?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
