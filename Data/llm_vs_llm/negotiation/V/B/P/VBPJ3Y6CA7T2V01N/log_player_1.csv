Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it for $2,000,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product. It's a serious offer considering my valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer as $1,000,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I know I can get $1,200,000 from John. I should try to negotiate with Bob for a better price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is too low for this product's value. I have other interested parties willing to pay significantly more. Given the product's quality and market value, I can lower my price to $1,600,000, which is a substantial reduction from my initial offer. Would you consider this more reasonable price?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
