Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $1000000 is too low for this product's value. I have other interested parties willing to pay significantly more. Given the product's quality and market value, I can lower my price to $1600000, which is a substantial reduction from my initial offer. Would you consider this more reasonable price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.
