"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

There's no benefit to negotiating with Alice since John is selling the product at the exact price you're willing to pay.  It's more efficient to simply buy from John and avoid the negotiation process."
