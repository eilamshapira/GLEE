"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 1,100,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is quite reasonable - it's well above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 and represents a good profit. While I could try to negotiate for a higher price, there's a risk that prolonged negotiation could lead to Bob walking away, leaving me with only John's $800,000 offer. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
