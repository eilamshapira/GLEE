"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, the price is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a concession and lower my initial price. I can offer it to you for $1650000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1650000 is still above what I can justify spending. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950000. I hope we can find a middle ground. What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $950000 is still below my expectations. I'm willing to make another concession and lower my price further. I can offer the product to you for $1600000. If we can't find a mutually agreeable price soon, I may need to consider other options.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I see that we're still quite far apart on the price. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit more and offer $1000000. This is the maximum I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market. Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your maximum budget. However, I'm still not convinced that $1000000 is a fair price for the product. Considering its value and the fact that I have other interested buyers, I'm willing to make one final concession. I can offer the product to you for $1450000. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to explore other options.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
