Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth and I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, the price is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me, and I have a better alternative with John, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a concession and lower my initial price. I can offer it to you for $1,650,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 1650000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1650000 is still above what I can justify spending. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950000. I hope we can find a middle ground. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower than the product's worth to me, and I have a better alternative with John. Since I have 6 more rounds to negotiate, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $950,000 is still below my expectations. I'm willing to make another concession and lower my price further. I can offer the product to you for $1,600,000. If we can't find a mutually agreeable price soon, I may need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I see that we're still quite far apart on the price. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit more and offer $1000000. This is the maximum I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Although Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a significant improvement, it's still $500,000 less than what I can get from John. Since Bob mentioned that this is the maximum he can go, it's unlikely that he'll increase his offer further. However, I'll try to negotiate one more time to see if I can get a better deal. If not, I'll consider selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your maximum budget. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,000,000 is a fair price for the product. Considering its value and the fact that I have other interested buyers, I'm willing to make one final concession. I can offer the product to you for $1,450,000. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1450000}"
