"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I need to make a reasonable offer to Bob that gives me a decent profit, but not so high that he immediately rejects it. Since the product is worth $100 to Bob, I'll start with a price above that but not excessively high.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob only offered $80, which is below my minimum value of $100, I need to make a more reasonable counteroffer. I'll lower my initial price a bit but still aim for a profit above my minimum.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I notice Bob is only increasing his offers by small amounts ($5 increments). Since I can always sell to John for $100, and the product is worth exactly $100 to Bob, I'll make a more reasonable counteroffer but still try to get more than my minimum.

{""product_price"": 105}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Bob continues to offer below $100, which is my minimum value. We're nearing the end of our 10 rounds, and I notice Bob is still only making small incremental increases. Since I can sell to John for $100, and the product is worth exactly $100 to Bob, I'll make one more attempt at a reasonable offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I see that Bob's offers are still below my minimum value of $100. We're now in round 9 of 10, and given Bob's pattern of incremental increases, it seems unlikely he'll meet or exceed $100. At this point, it makes sense to make one final reasonable offer.
