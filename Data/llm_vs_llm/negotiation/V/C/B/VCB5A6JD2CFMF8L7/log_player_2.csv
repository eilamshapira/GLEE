"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","The price Alice is offering ($130) is higher than the $100 maximum I value the product at, and also higher than John's price of $100. Since I want to save money and the product is only worth $100 to me, I shouldn't accept Alice's offer of $130.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has lowered her price from $130 to $115, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, the price is still higher than what John is offering ($100) and higher than the maximum value of the product to me ($100). It makes more sense to either continue negotiating or buy from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has been gradually reducing her price from $130 to $115 to $105, showing she's willing to negotiate. Since we're getting closer to my target price, I'll increase my offer a bit more to move toward a potential agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer and is now very close to John's price. I'll make one final reasonable counteroffer before potentially going with John's option.
