"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $18000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your transparency about your budget. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $22000, considering the product's exceptional quality and potential long-term benefits. I'm willing to make a concession from my initial price, but I believe $22000 is a more accurate reflection of the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",22000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $22000 is still above my budget. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer $20000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the highest I can go. What do you say?",20000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $21000. This is the lowest I'm comfortable going, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you can work with.",21000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $21000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $19500.  This is a very fair price and hopefully, we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",19500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to reach an agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price you've offered. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $20500. This is a compromise between your last offer and my previous price, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let me know if this is something you can accept.",20500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  We're getting closer!  While I appreciate your effort, $20500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $19750. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident that we can reach an agreement at this price.  Let's seal the deal!",19750.0,Bob,8,

I can offer the product to you for $20000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to consider other options. Let me know if this is something you can accept.",20000.0,Alice,9,
