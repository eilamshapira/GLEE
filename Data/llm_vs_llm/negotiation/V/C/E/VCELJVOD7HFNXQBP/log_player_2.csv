"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $20000. I believe it's a fair price, but I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's start with a counteroffer, given that Alice's initial price is significantly higher than what John is offering. I'll provide a counteroffer that is much lower but still leaves room for negotiation.

Counteroffer: $4,000

Let's see how Alice responds to this counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I find the price a bit high. I'm willing to purchase the product for $4,000."", ""product_price"": 4000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, I must say that $4000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $18000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has reduced her price, but it's still much higher than what John is offering. I'll make another counteroffer that is higher than my previous offer but still much lower than Alice's current offer.

Counteroffer: $6,000

Let's see how Alice responds to this counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I still find the price a bit high. I'm willing to raise my offer to $6,000."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for raising your offer, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $6000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $16000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is slowly coming down on her price, but it's still double what John is offering. I'll make another counteroffer that is higher than my previous offer but still much lower than Alice's current offer.

Counteroffer: $7,000

If Alice rejects this offer, I might consider buying from John, as Alice's price is still quite high compared to John's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Alice. I'm willing to raise my offer again to $7,000. This is a significant increase from my initial offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued efforts to reach an agreement, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to raise your offer. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $7000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $14000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's price is still significantly higher than John's. I don't think further negotiation will bring Alice's price down to a level that is more competitive with John's offer. Therefore, I'll buy the product from John for $8,000."
