"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I find $14000 to be quite high for this product. Given market conditions and comparable products, I would be willing to pay $9500. This would still provide you with a healthy profit margin while being more reasonable for me.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for continuing the discussion. I understand that we need to find a middle ground. Given your feedback and our production costs, we're willing to lower our offer to $11000. This price reflects the product's high quality and the value it will bring to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. Your significant reduction shows we can work together to find a fair price. While $11000 is better, I believe we're still not quite there. I can increase my offer to $10000, which represents a fair markup over your costs while being a reasonable price for me. This is a 500-dollar increase from my previous offer, showing my commitment to reaching an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I believe we're very close to an agreement. In an effort to meet you in the middle, we're willing to reduce our price to $10250. This offer demonstrates our eagerness to work with you and finds a reasonable compromise between our previous offers.",10250.0,Alice,5,
