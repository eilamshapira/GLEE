Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I find $14000 to be quite high for this product. Given market conditions and comparable products, I would be willing to pay $9500. This would still provide you with a healthy profit margin while being more reasonable for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. Your significant reduction shows we can work together to find a fair price. While $11000 is better, I believe we're still not quite there. I can increase my offer to $10000, which represents a fair markup over your costs while being a reasonable price for me. This is a 500-dollar increase from my previous offer, showing my commitment to reaching an agreement.
