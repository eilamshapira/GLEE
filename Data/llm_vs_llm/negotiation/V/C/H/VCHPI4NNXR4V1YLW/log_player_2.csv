"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Looking at Alice's offer:
- Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000
- The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
- I can buy the same product from John for $800,000

Since Alice's price ($1,500,000) is significantly higher than both the product's value to me and John's alternative offer, the rational choice is to buy from John and save $700,000.
