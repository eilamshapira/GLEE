"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I believe the product has value, but $1500000 is above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000? This leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that you want to ensure a fair price, but $1050000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we try $750000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $750000 is closer to my target, it's still not quite there.  Let's find a mutually agreeable middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This would ensure a fair deal for both of us and allows for a successful partnership.  What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,5,
