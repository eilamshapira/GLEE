Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price to offer Bob for the product. I know the product is worth at least $80 to me, and I have a fallback option of selling to John for exactly $80.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I need to balance between offering a higher price (to maximize my profit) and the risk of Bob rejecting my offer. If Bob rejects, I'll still get $80 from John, so any price I offer Bob should be above $80.

I'll set the price higher than my minimum, but not so high that Bob would likely reject it outright.
