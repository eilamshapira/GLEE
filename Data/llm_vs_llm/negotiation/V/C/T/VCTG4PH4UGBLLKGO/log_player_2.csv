"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer is $120 and John's price is also $120, there's no financial advantage to choosing one over the other. In this case, I might as well accept Alice's offer since it's immediately available and equal to my maximum value for the product.
