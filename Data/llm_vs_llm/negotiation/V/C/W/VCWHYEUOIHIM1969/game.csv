"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! The product sounds great, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it.",80.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. However, $80 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a great deal for the quality you're getting. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's meet in the middle. How about $110? This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for the new offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down. However, $110 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. How about $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I see where you're coming from, but $90 is still below what I can accept. Let's try $105. It's very close to your last offer and still within a reasonable range for me. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm willing to go a bit lower to meet you halfway. How about $102? This is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you.",102.0,Alice,5,
