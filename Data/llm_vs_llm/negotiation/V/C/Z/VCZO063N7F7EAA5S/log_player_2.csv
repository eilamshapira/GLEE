"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8500.  It's worth at least $8000 to me, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is higher than what you're willing to pay and higher than John's price.  There's room for negotiation."
