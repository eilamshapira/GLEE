"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","If I analyze this situation:

Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000, which exceeds the maximum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me.

John (spelled ""Jhon"" in the options) is offering the same product for $1,000,000, which is exactly the maximum value I place on the product.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and Alice's offer exceeds both my valuation and John's price, the logical choice is to buy from John.
