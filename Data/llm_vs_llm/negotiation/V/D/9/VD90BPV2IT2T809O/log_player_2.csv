"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $12000. This is a competitive price for such a product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $8,000
2. Alice's current offer is $12,000, which is significantly above my maximum value
3. John is offering the product for $8,000, which is equal to my maximum value
4. Alice's initial offer is quite high ($12,000), and even though we could negotiate, there's no guarantee she'll go below $8,000 since the product is worth $10,000 to her

Since Alice's initial offer is well above my maximum value ($8,000), and John is offering exactly at my maximum acceptable price, it would be most rational to buy from John. Even if I negotiate with Alice, she's unlikely to go below her own value of $10,000, which is still above my maximum.
