Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 150}

Since the product is worth $150 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $150, there's no reason for me to offer Bob a lower price. Bob values the product at only $80, so he will likely reject my offer, but that's fine because I can then sell to John for $150 and maximize my earnings."
