"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Given the information, I need to make a decision that maximizes my benefit.

Alice is offering the product for $150, which exceeds my maximum value of $80.

I have an alternative option to buy from John for $80, which exactly matches my maximum value.

I could also reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, but since I already have a guaranteed option at my maximum value, there's no reason to engage in further negotiation with Alice when her initial offer is so much higher.
