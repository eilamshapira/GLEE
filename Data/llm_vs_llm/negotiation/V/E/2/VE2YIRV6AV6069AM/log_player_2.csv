"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

This is an easy decision because Alice's offer ($200) is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($100) and John's fixed price ($100). There's no reason to accept Alice's offer or continue negotiating when I can get the product at my maximum acceptable price from John."
