(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(Let's see if Alice can lower her price. Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, paying $20,000 is not an option. I'll also hold off on buying from John for now, as I might be able to get a better deal from Alice.)

Counteroffer: $8,000"
