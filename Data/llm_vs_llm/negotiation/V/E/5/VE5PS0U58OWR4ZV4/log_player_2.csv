"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The asking price of $1,200,000 is above my maximum value of $1,000,000, and it's also higher than John's price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to Alice, hoping to negotiate a better price. If we can't reach an agreement, I always have the option to buy from John at $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 800000}

I'll offer $800,000, which is below John's price of $1,000,000. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to buying from John. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, this offer might be low enough to negotiate but not so low as to be considered insulting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer of $1,000,000. This price is equal to John's price and equals my maximum value for the product. Since we've reached a point where Alice is offering the same price as John, and it's unlikely we'll get a better deal through further negotiation, it's best to accept this offer and conclude the deal."
