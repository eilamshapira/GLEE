Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price to offer Bob. Given that I don't know how much Bob values the product, and I have a guaranteed backup option of selling to John for $150, I should offer a price above $150.

I'll set the price at $220, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This gives me the opportunity to make a good profit while still being potentially reasonable for Bob. If Bob rejects this price, I still have my guaranteed $150 from John.
