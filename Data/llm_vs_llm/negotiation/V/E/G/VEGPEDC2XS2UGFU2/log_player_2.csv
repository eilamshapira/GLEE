"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'll analyze the situation:
1. The product is worth $80 to me (maximum I'm willing to pay)
2. Alice is offering it for $120, which is well above my maximum value
3. John is offering it for $80, which matches my maximum value
4. Alice's initial offer of $120 is too high, and I could try negotiating, but...
5. I already have a guaranteed option to buy at $80 from John

Since Alice's offer ($120) is significantly above my maximum value ($80), and John is offering exactly at my maximum value, I should reject this offer. However, rather than continuing negotiations with Alice when I already have a guaranteed acceptable price from John, the most rational decision is to buy from John.
