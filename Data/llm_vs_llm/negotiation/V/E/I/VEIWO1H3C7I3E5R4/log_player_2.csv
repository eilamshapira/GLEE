"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, I don't want to pay $150. I also have the option to buy it from John for $100, which is within my budget. However, I'd like to try to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm willing to pay up to $100, I'll start by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's new offer of $120 is still higher than I'm willing to pay, which is $100. However, it's lower than her initial offer of $150, so she's moving in the right direction.

I'll reject her offer again and try to negotiate further. Maybe I can get her to lower the price even more.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $120, I'll try to meet her halfway between her offer and my previous counteroffer of $80. However, I'll also keep in mind that I can buy the product from John for $100, so I won't go too high.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's new offer of $110 is getting closer to my target price, but it's still $10 higher than I'm willing to pay. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $100, which is a better deal, I think I'll stop negotiating with Alice and go with the better option.
