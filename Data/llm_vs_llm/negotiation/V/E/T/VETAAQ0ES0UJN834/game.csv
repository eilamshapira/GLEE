"Hi Bob, I'm selling a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $95. This is a competitive price considering the product's quality and value.",95.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product, but I need to be honest that $95 is beyond what I'm willing to pay. I know I can get this same product elsewhere for $80. However, I'd like to continue our negotiation. I'm offering $70 for your product. This gives you a quick sale without the hassle of finding another buyer, and allows me to save a bit compared to my alternative option.",70.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I can't go as low as $70 since the product costs me $80. I actually have another buyer, John, who's willing to pay me $80 already. However, I'd prefer to sell to you if we can agree on a fair price. I can come down to $88, which still gives you a good value while allowing me to make a small profit.",88.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, I want to be straightforward - I know I can purchase this product from John for exactly $80, so I have no incentive to pay more than that. I'm actually offering $75, which would still give you a quick sale without having to wait for another buyer. While you mentioned having another buyer at $80, I'm ready to complete this transaction immediately if we can agree on my offer. If not, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's option.",75.0,Bob,4,
