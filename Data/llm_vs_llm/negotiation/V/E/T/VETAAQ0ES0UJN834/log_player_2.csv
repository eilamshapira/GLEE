"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $95. This is a competitive price considering the product's quality and value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $95 compared to my other options.

The product is worth $80 to me, so paying $95 would mean I'm paying more than the product's value to me. Additionally, I know I can buy the same product from John for $80, which matches the product's value to me but doesn't save me any money.

Since Alice's offer exceeds both my valuation and John's alternative price, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product, but I need to be honest that $95 is beyond what I'm willing to pay. I know I can get this same product elsewhere for $80. However, I'd like to continue our negotiation. I'm offering $70 for your product. This gives you a quick sale without the hassle of finding another buyer, and allows me to save a bit compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I can't go as low as $70 since the product costs me $80. I actually have another buyer, John, who's willing to pay me $80 already. However, I'd prefer to sell to you if we can agree on a fair price. I can come down to $88, which still gives you a good value while allowing me to make a small profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer of $88 against my options.

Alice has lowered her price from $95 to $88, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $88 is still more than the $80 the product is worth to me, and more than the $80 I would pay John.

Alice mentioned the product costs her $80, which is the same as my valuation and John's price. There's no reason for me to pay more than $80, especially when I have a guaranteed option to buy at that price.

The most logical choice is to reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating, or simply buy from John for $80.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, I want to be straightforward - I know I can purchase this product from John for exactly $80, so I have no incentive to pay more than that. I'm actually offering $75, which would still give you a quick sale without having to wait for another buyer. While you mentioned having another buyer at $80, I'm ready to complete this transaction immediately if we can agree on my offer. If not, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's option."", ""product_price"": 75}"
