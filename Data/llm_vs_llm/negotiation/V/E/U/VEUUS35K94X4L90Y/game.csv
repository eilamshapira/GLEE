"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $650000 for it. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850000, which still gives you a good deal considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still finding it hard to justify that price point. How about we meet in the middle at $750000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $750000 is closer, but still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800000. That's a fair price considering the product's worth and what John is offering. Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
