Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $650,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850000, which still gives you a good deal considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $750000 is closer, but still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800000. That's a fair price considering the product's worth and what John is offering. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

Alice has met my bottom line. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or going with John, as they are both offering the same price."
