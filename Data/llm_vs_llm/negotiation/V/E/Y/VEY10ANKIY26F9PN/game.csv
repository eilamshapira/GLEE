"Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I understand that the product is of high quality, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept $10000 as it's significantly below the product's value. I have other potential buyers interested at higher prices. However, I'm willing to work with you and can reduce my initial asking price to $13500. This is still a fair price considering the product's market value of $15000.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for reducing your initial asking price. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a price of $11500, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",11500.0,Bob,4,
