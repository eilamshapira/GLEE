"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I know would be valuable for you. Given its market value and exceptional quality, I'm offering it to you for $14,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I understand that the product is of high quality, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and I can always sell to John for that amount. I'll try to negotiate with Bob for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept $10,000 as it's significantly below the product's value. I have other potential buyers interested at higher prices. However, I'm willing to work with you and can reduce my initial asking price to $13,500. This is still a fair price considering the product's market value of $15,000."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for reducing your initial asking price. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a price of $11500, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $12,000. Bob's offer of $11,500 is still below what John is willing to pay, and based on the negotiation pattern, it seems unlikely that Bob will reach a price above $12,000. It's better to secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John rather than risk further negotiations that might not yield a better result."
