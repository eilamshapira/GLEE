"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $25000 is significantly beyond my budget. I'm more comfortable with a price of $5000, considering the alternatives I have. I hope we can find a price that works for both of us.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad you're willing to negotiate. However, $5000 is a bit too low for me, considering the product's value and the other offers I have on the table. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between my initial price and your offer. I'd like to propose a price of $20000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",20000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, Alice. However, $20000 is still beyond what I can afford. I am prepared to increase my offer to $6000, keeping in mind that I have a fixed budget and other alternatives at $8000. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",6000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price, and I'm glad you're still interested in the product. Considering your budget constraints and the alternatives you mentioned, I'm willing to make a more significant concession. I'd like to propose a price of $18000, which is closer to the midpoint between my initial price and your revised offer. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",18000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for further reducing the price, Alice. However, $18000 is still above what I can allocate for this purchase. I am willing to adjust my offer to $7000, taking into account the competitive offer I have from another seller at $8000. I hope we can reach an agreement soon.",7000.0,Bob,6,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your continued interest in the product, and I'm glad we're making progress. Considering your budget constraints and the competitive offer you mentioned, I'm willing to make a more substantial concession. I'd like to propose a price of $14000, which is very close to the lowest price I'm willing to accept. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed. However, I want to emphasize that I have other options available, and I may need to consider them if we can't reach an agreement soon.",14000.0,Alice,7,
