Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price, considering the current market conditions. I'd like to propose a price that I believe is fair for both of us.

I reject Bob's offer of $900,000 because it's significantly lower than the product's value to me and to Bob. I believe we can negotiate a better price. My next step will be to send a counteroffer to Bob."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I agree that the product has significant value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price you've proposed.

I reject Bob's offer of $1,150,000. Although it's getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, I still believe I can get a better deal, especially since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob. I'll send another counteroffer to try to close the gap."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

I accept Bob's offer of $1,250,000. This price is higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($1,200,000) and closer to the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000). Given that we're running out of rounds and the risk of not reaching an agreement, I believe $1,250,000 is a fair price that benefits both parties."
