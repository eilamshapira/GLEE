"Alice's offer: The product price will be $225. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $225
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $150 to me
2. Alice's offer is $225
3. John's offer is $150

Alice's offer ($225) is significantly higher than both:
- The maximum value I place on the product ($150)
- John's alternative offer ($150)

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer would mean overpaying by $75. Since I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $150, which matches my maximum valuation, the rational choice is to buy from John.
