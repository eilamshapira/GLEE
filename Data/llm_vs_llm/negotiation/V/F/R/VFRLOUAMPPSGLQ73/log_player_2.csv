"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I'll need to analyze this situation carefully:

Alice is offering the product for $1,600,000, which is:
- $600,000 more than my maximum valuation ($1,000,000)
- $600,000 more than John's alternative price ($1,000,000)

This offer doesn't make economic sense for me. I can get the same product from John for much less, and the current offer is even above my maximum valuation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I need to make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to her and I can get it elsewhere for $1,000,000, I'll start with a low offer to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": $850,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has reduced her offer to $1,500,000, which is still:
- $500,000 more than my maximum valuation ($1,000,000)
- $500,000 more than John's alternative price ($1,000,000)

This offer still doesn't make economic sense for me. I can get the same product from John for much less, and the current offer is still above my maximum valuation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer a bit, but I'm still constrained by the fact that I can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, and that's my maximum valuation anyway.
