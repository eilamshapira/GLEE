Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m prepared to offer you the product for $1000000. Let me know if you’re ready to accept this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer is the same price as John's ($1,000,000), and the product is only worth $800,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation to get a better price. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably above Alice's cost ($800,000) but significantly below the asking price, giving room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,000,000 is too high for this product. Since I know the product is worth $800,000 to you, I'm willing to offer $850,000, which would give you a fair profit while being more reasonable for me."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. Given the product's unique qualities and value, I'm prepared to let it go for $930000. I believe this price reflects a fair balance between our valuations. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has made a significant reduction from her initial $1,000,000 offer to $930,000, but there's still room for negotiation. Given that the product is worth $800,000 to her and we have several rounds left, I'll reject this offer and try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still try to keep the price advantageous for me. I'll aim for a middle ground between my last offer ($850,000) and Alice's latest offer ($930,000).

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $930,000 is still quite high. I can increase my offer to $885,000, which would give you a very healthy profit margin above your $800,000 cost. This seems like a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 885000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Reflecting on your offer and the product’s exceptional quality, I'm prepared to finalize the deal at $900000. I believe this figure represents a fair compromise and a strong agreement for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has made another significant concession, coming down to $900,000, which is a $100,000 reduction from her initial offer and only $15,000 above my last counteroffer. This is a good price point that gives both parties a fair deal - it's significantly below John's price of $1,000,000 and gives Alice a reasonable profit above her $800,000 cost. At this point, continuing to negotiate for a small additional reduction might risk the deal, and we might not get much better terms.
