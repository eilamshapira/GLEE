"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. If you decide to pass, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $800000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is below this threshold, I should consider whether I can get a better deal. However, rejecting Alice's offer means I would have to buy from John for $1,500,000, which is more expensive. Given that Alice's offer is $300,000 less than what I'm willing to pay, it seems like a reasonable deal compared to the alternative of buying from John.
