Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150 and also lower than what I know the product is worth to him ($120), I will reject his offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

My counteroffer will be $140, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price and also takes into account that Bob values the product at $120.

So, my decision is to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer of $140.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's new offer of $90 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150 and also lower than what I know the product is worth to him ($120). However, it's slightly better than his previous offer of $80.

Considering that I have the option to sell the product to John for $150, which is my minimum acceptable price, I don't see a need to compromise further with Bob.

My decision is to reject Bob's offer and sell the product to John for $150.
