"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for Round 1:

```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Profit Motive:** I want to maximize my profit.
*   **Uncertainty about Bob's Value:** I don't know what the product is worth to Bob, so I need to start high to gauge his interest.
*   **Anchoring Bias:** Starting with a higher price can create an anchoring bias, potentially influencing Bob to perceive the product as more valuable.
*   **Negotiation Room:** This price gives me plenty of room to negotiate downwards if needed, while still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $100.
*   **Outside Option Awareness:** I keep in mind my option to sell to John for $100. This prevents me from being pushed too low in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. It is highly unlikely that I'll be able to negotiate him up to a price that is profitable for me within the remaining rounds, especially considering his initial offer is so low. Selling to John guarantees me $100, which is a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer."
