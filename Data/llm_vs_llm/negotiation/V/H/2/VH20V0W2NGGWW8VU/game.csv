"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm confident it's worth at least $1200000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm starting with an offer price of $1500000. Please consider this carefully, as I'm only offering this price for a limited time.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is tempting, it's significantly below what I believe the product's worth. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price. How about $1400000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good value.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your initial asking price.  I'm still interested in the product, but $1400000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - how about $1300000?  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1300000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about $1350000? This would be a good middle ground for both of us, and would allow me to move forward with the sale. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
