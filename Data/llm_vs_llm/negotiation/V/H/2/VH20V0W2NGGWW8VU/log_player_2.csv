"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm confident it's worth at least $1200000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm starting with an offer price of $1500000. Please consider this carefully, as I'm only offering this price for a limited time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay.  I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is tempting, it's significantly below what I believe the product's worth. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price. How about $1400000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still above my ideal price point.  I'll try to counter with a lower offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your initial asking price.  I'm still interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - how about $1,300,000?  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1300000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about $1350000? This would be a good middle ground for both of us, and would allow me to move forward with the sale. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a slightly lower price, $1,350,000 is within my budget and a good deal compared to John's offer. It's also likely Alice won't budge further.  Accepting is the best option at this point."
