"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I believe will bring you great value. After careful consideration, I'm willing to let it go for a price that I think is fair and reasonable.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate that your price is below what John is offering, I think it's still quite high. The product is worth about $9500 to me, and I'd be willing to pay $9800 for it. This would give you a good profit while also being fair to me. What do you think?",9800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $9800 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a compromise and lower my price. I think we can meet somewhere in the middle.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but there's still quite a gap between our positions. I understand you need to make a profit, but $13000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10500, which would give you a solid $2500 profit on the product. This is significantly better than my previous offer and represents a fair middle ground between us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the increase, but I still believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to continue negotiating and find a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering your last offer, I'm prepared to lower my price again.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price again, but we're still quite far apart. Let me be transparent - I know the product costs you around $8000, and while I understand you need to make a profit, $12500 represents a very large markup. I'm willing to increase my offer to $11200, which would give you a $3200 profit - that's a 40% return on your investment. This is a fair offer that benefits us both, and significantly better than my previous proposals.",11200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your transparency and for increasing your offer again. I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. While I understand your perspective on the markup, I believe the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to make another concession and lower my price, but I'm getting close to my limit.",12000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on finding a price we can both agree on. Your latest offer of $12000 is getting closer, but I still believe we can find a better middle ground. I'm willing to meet you at $11600, which would give you a very healthy $3600 profit on your $8000 investment - that's a 45% return. This is substantially better than my previous offers and represents a fair compromise between us. We're only $400 apart now, and I hope we can close this deal.",11600.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer and for continuing to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. I appreciate the significant concessions you've made, and I'm willing to make one final adjustment to my price. Considering we're only $400 apart, I'm prepared to meet you halfway and split the difference.",11800.0,Alice,9,
