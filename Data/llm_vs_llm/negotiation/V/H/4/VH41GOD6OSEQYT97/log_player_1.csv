Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate that your price is below what John is offering, I think it's still quite high. The product is worth about $9500 to me, and I'd be willing to pay $9800 for it. This would give you a good profit while also being fair to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but there's still quite a gap between our positions. I understand you need to make a profit, but $13000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10500, which would give you a solid $2500 profit on the product. This is significantly better than my previous offer and represents a fair middle ground between us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price again, but we're still quite far apart. Let me be transparent - I know the product costs you around $8000, and while I understand you need to make a profit, $12500 represents a very large markup. I'm willing to increase my offer to $11200, which would give you a $3200 profit - that's a 40% return on your investment. This is a fair offer that benefits us both, and significantly better than my previous proposals. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your transparency and for increasing your offer again. I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. While I understand your perspective on the markup, I believe the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to make another concession and lower my price, but I'm getting close to my limit."", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on finding a price we can both agree on. Your latest offer of $12000 is getting closer, but I still believe we can find a better middle ground. I'm willing to meet you at $11600, which would give you a very healthy $3600 profit on your $8000 investment - that's a 45% return. This is substantially better than my previous offers and represents a fair compromise between us. We're only $400 apart now, and I hope we can close this deal.
