"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a premium product available for purchase. This is a high-quality item that I'm confident will provide excellent value. I'm offering it to you for $175. This price reflects the product's quality and market value. Would you like to purchase it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $175 against my alternatives.

The product is worth no more than $120 to me. John is willing to sell me the same product for $120, which matches my maximum valuation.

Alice's offer of $175 exceeds my valuation by $55, making it a poor deal for me.
