"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $1,800,000 is higher than John's price of $1,500,000, so it wouldn't make sense to accept it. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can negotiate a better price, knowing I always have John's offer as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer significantly lower than John's price to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to be insulting.

{""product_price"": 1000000}

This offer of $1,000,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's well below John's price of $1,500,000, which gives room for Alice to counter while still potentially allowing me to get a better deal than John's offer. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground that's below $1,500,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice only reduced her price by $100,000, from $1,800,000 to $1,700,000, and it's still above John's price of $1,500,000. There's no reason to accept this offer when I can get the same product for $200,000 less from John. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price below $1,500,000. If Alice doesn't come down significantly in future rounds, I can always take John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still stay well below John's price to maintain negotiating room.

{""product_price"": 1200000}

This offer of $1,200,000 represents a $200,000 increase from my previous offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still being $300,000 below John's price. This gives Alice room to counter while potentially allowing me to secure a better deal than John's $1,500,000. If Alice still isn't willing to come down to a price below John's offer, I can always fall back on John's option."
