"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $11000 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend. The product is worth around $6000 to me, and I already have another offer from John for $8000. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $6500 for the product. What do you think?",6500.0,Bob,2,
