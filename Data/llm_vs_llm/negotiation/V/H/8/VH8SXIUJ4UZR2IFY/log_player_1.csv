"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity for you to purchase this amazing product. I believe it will bring you great value. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $11000 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend. The product is worth around $6000 to me, and I already have another offer from John for $8000. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $6500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
