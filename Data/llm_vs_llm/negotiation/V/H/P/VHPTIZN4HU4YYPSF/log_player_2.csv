"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you the product. Considering your interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for a special price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","After reviewing Alice's offer, I need to consider what makes the most financial sense for me.

Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which is $3,000 more than the product is worth to me (since it's stated that the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me).

John is willing to sell me the same product for $12,000, which matches the maximum value I place on this product.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and Alice's offer exceeds both my valuation and the alternative option from John, the logical choice is to buy from John.
