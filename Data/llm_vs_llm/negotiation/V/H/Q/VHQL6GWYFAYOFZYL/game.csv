"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  My starting price is $1200000.  This reflects the product's value and leaves room for negotiation.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $850000? That feels like a fairer starting point.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is a bit too low for me. The product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm confident it will be worth even more to you in the long run.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This gives you a significant saving and allows me to make a fair return on my investment. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Let's try to meet closer to the middle. Would you consider $925000? That's a significant move from my previous offer.",925000.0,Bob,4,
