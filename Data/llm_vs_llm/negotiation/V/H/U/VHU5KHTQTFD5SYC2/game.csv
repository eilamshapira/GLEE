"Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  I'm confident it would be a valuable asset to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price around $400000. I believe this aligns more with my budget and the value I'm looking to gain from the product.",400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your initial offer, but $400000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers substantial returns and unique advantages. I'm willing to come down to $1800000.  This is a considerable adjustment, reflecting my desire to find common ground while ensuring a fair price.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1800000 is still quite high. Let's meet in the middle at $600000. I believe this price point considers both our interests fairly.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to reach an agreement here.  $600000 remains too low considering the potential returns this product offers. Let's try $1600000. I believe this price point represents significant value for you while still recognizing the product's worth.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
