"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your initial offer, but $400000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers substantial returns and unique advantages. I'm willing to come down to $1800000.  This is a considerable adjustment, reflecting my desire to find common ground while ensuring a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

(Alice is going down with the price, so let's try to negotiate more.)

Your counteroffer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to reach an agreement here.  $600000 remains too low considering the potential returns this product offers. Let's try $1600000. I believe this price point represents significant value for you while still recognizing the product's worth.

(Alice isn't willing to lower the price significantly, and the current offer is still much higher than what John is offering. It's better to buy from John at this point.)"
