"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $250 is far too high, considering the product is only worth $80 to me and I have John's offer as a backup. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 50}

I'll start with a low offer of $50. Since I know I can always buy from John for $80, I want to see if I can get a better deal from Alice. This gives room for negotiation while still staying well below my maximum value of $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $220. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $220
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $220 is still way too high, as it's nearly three times what I can get from John ($80). She only reduced the price by $30 from her initial offer, showing very little movement. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round to try to get a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 60}

I'll increase my offer slightly to $60. This shows some willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price well below John's offer of $80. Since Alice's previous counteroffers have been very high, I want to maintain a low position to leave room for negotiation, while still showing some movement in her direction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offers are consistently remaining far above my maximum value of $80, only dropping by small increments ($250 -> $220 -> $200). At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a price below $80 in the remaining rounds. Since I can get the product from John for $80, which is my maximum value, it makes more sense to end the negotiation with Alice and take John's offer rather than continue this unproductive negotiation."
