"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $10000 is out of my budget. How about we settle at $7000 for the product? Let me know if we can make that work.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot go as low as $7000 as that would be below my cost. However, I can come down from my initial offer. I can offer you the product for $9000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents excellent value for this product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
