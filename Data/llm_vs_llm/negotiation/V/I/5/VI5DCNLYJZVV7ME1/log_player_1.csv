Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to think about my pricing strategy. Since the product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price, I don't want to sell for less than $15,000.

When pricing for Bob, I need to consider that I don't know how much the product is worth to him. If I price too high, he might reject the offer. If I price too low, I might leave money on the table.

Since I have the $15,000 fallback from John, I can be somewhat aggressive in my pricing to Bob. I'll offer a price that gives me potential upside while knowing I won't lose anything compared to my guaranteed alternative.
