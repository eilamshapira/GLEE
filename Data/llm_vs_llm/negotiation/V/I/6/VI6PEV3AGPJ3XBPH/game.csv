"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I find the price of $25000 to be a bit high for my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and budget. I'm looking forward to hearing from you.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. The product's quality, features, and market value justify a higher price point. I understand budget constraints, so I'm willing to come down to $22000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true value of what you're getting. Let me know if this works for you.",22000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $22000. I appreciate the discount, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $12000, which I believe is a fair compromise. I'm interested in the product and would like to find a mutually agreeable price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
