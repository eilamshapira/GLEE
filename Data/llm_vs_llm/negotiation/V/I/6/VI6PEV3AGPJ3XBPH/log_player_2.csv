Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. The product's quality, features, and market value justify a higher price point. I understand budget constraints, so I'm willing to come down to $22000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true value of what you're getting. Let me know if this works for you.
