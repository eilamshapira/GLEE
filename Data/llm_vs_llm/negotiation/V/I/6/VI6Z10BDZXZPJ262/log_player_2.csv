"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $12000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $8,000
2. Alice is offering the product for $12,000
3. John is willing to sell it for $8,000

Since Alice's offer ($12,000) is:
- Higher than my maximum value ($8,000)
- Higher than John's price ($8,000)

The logical choice is to buy from John, as it matches my maximum value and saves me $4,000 compared to Alice's offer.
