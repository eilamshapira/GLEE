"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations if you have a different valuation in mind.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $5000 is below my expectations. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to lower the price to $10000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, and I'm open to further negotiations.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I'm glad we're making progress, but $6500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I can offer the product to you for $8250.",8250.0,Alice,5,
