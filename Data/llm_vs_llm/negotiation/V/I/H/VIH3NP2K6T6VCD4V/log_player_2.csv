"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product I think you might be interested in. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it would be a great addition to your portfolio.  I'm offering it to you for $1000000. This is a fair price, considering the potential value it holds. Let me know if you'd like to discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000
2. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
3. John is offering the same product for $800,000
4. My goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible

Since:
- Alice's offer ($1,000,000) is higher than the product's worth to me ($800,000)
- John's offer ($800,000) matches the maximum value I place on the product
- I can save $200,000 by buying from John

The logical choice is to buy from John.
