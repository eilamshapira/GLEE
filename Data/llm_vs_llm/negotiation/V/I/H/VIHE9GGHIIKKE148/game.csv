"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. It's a great price considering its potential, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product sounds interesting, $20000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $5000 for it.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. $5000 is unfortunately far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17000, which is a significant discount from my original offer.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here. ",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $17000 is still too high for me. I am willing to increase my offer to $6000. Please consider this.",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to find common ground here.  $6000 is simply too far below the value of the product.  I'm willing to go as low as $15000, but that's my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers. ",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $15000 is still beyond what I'm willing to pay. My maximum is $7000. If that doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options. Let me know.",7000.0,Bob,6,
