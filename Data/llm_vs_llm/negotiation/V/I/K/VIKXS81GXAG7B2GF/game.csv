"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $2000000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it, reflecting its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $2000000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $1200000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I can offer you a slight discount from my initial price.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1800000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1200000. This represents a fair price for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I still need to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and your offer. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $1500000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference again. I'll offer you $1350000, and hopefully we can close this deal.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
