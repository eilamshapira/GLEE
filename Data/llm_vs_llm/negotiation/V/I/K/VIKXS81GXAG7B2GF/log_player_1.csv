Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1800000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1200000. This represents a fair price for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works.

I decide to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. Although Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I have the option to sell it to John for $1,500,000, which meets my minimum requirement. Since the negotiation with Bob is taking a while and the price is still not satisfactory, I choose to sell the product to John to ensure I get the price I want."
