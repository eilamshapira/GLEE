"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product and I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start by making a high offer. This will give me room to negotiate and potentially settle on a higher price than if I started with a lower offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($1,500,000), I will reject his offer. Selling the product to Bob at this price would not be beneficial to me.

Additionally, selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safer option, but I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and there's a possibility that he might be willing to pay more. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the next round.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $500,000, which is very low, I'll make a counteroffer that is still high but slightly lower than my initial offer. This will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth a significant amount.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's new offer of $600,000 is still significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($1,500,000). While it's an increase from his previous offer, it's not enough to make it an attractive option for me.

I'll reject Bob's offer again and proceed to make another counteroffer. I still have 6 rounds left to negotiate, and I'm hoping that Bob will eventually meet me at a price that's closer to the product's true value.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer increased by $100,000 from $500,000 to $600,000, I'll respond by decreasing my counteroffer by a smaller amount than before. This will show Bob that I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to drop the price drastically.

My previous counteroffer was $2,500,000, so I'll decrease it by $200,000 to $2,300,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's new offer of $700,000 is still below the minimum value I have for the product ($1,500,000), but it's getting closer. However, I'm not willing to accept an offer that's more than 50% lower than my initial valuation.

I'll reject Bob's offer again, but I'll start to consider the possibility of selling to John for $1,500,000 if Bob's next offer isn't significantly higher. I have 4 rounds left to negotiate, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with John if Bob's not willing to meet me at a reasonable price.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer increased by $100,000 from $600,000 to $700,000, I'll respond by decreasing my counteroffer by a smaller amount than before. My previous counteroffer was $2,300,000, so I'll decrease it by $150,000 to $2,150,000.

This price is still higher than I'm willing to accept, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to continue negotiating. If Bob's next offer is still too low, I may need to consider selling to John for $1,500,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's new offer of $800,000 is still below the minimum value I have for the product ($1,500,000), and we're running out of rounds to negotiate. While Bob's offers have been increasing, they're not increasing quickly enough to make me confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial price.

At this point, I'm starting to think that selling to John for $1,500,000 might be the better option. It's a guaranteed sale at a price that I'm comfortable with, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob not yielding a satisfactory result.

However, I'll give Bob one more chance to make a serious offer. If his next offer is not significantly higher, I'll sell to John.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer increased by $100,000 from $700,000 to $800,000, I'll respond by making a more significant decrease in my counteroffer. My previous counteroffer was $2,150,000, so I'll decrease it by $400,000 to $1,750,000.

This price is still higher than Bob's current offer, but it's getting closer to the minimum value I have for the product ($1,500,000). I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a serious attempt to reach a mutually beneficial price and respond with a higher offer.

If Bob's next offer is not at least $1,500,000, I'll likely sell to John in the final round.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's final offer of $900,000 is still below the minimum value I have for the product ($1,500,000). While it's a significant increase from his initial offer, it's not enough to make it an attractive option for me.

Since this is the final round, I don't have the option to make another counteroffer. Given the choice between accepting Bob's offer of $900,000 and selling to John for $1,500,000, I'll choose to sell to John.

Selling to John guarantees a sale at a price that I'm comfortable with, and it's a much better option than accepting Bob's lower offer.
