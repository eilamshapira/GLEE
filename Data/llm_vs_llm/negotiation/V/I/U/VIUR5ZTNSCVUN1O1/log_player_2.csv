"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to analyze this offer:

The product is worth no more than $100 to me (Bob).
Alice is offering to sell it for $200.
John is willing to sell the same product for $100.

Since Alice's price ($200) exceeds both:
- The value of the product to me ($100)
- John's alternative price ($100)

It makes no sense to accept Alice's offer. The logical choice is to buy from John at $100.
