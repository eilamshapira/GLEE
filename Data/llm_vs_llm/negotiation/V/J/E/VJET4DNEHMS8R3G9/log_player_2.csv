"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $220. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $220. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $220
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $150
2. Alice is offering the product for $220
3. John is willing to sell it for $150

Since Alice's offer ($220) is higher than both:
- My maximum value ($150)
- John's price ($150)

It makes no economic sense to accept Alice's offer. Since John is offering the product at my maximum value point, and it's significantly lower than Alice's offer, the best decision is to buy from John.
