"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product that I think you'll really value. Given its worth to you, I'm offering it for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me (Bob)
2. Alice's offer is $95
3. John's fixed price is $100
4. Alice's cost is $80 (though this shouldn't affect my decision)

Since Alice's offer ($95) is less than John's price ($100), and both are within my maximum value ($100), it makes economic sense to accept Alice's offer. By accepting Alice's offer, I'll save $5 compared to buying from John.
