"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm starting with a competitive price, considering the product's worth to me."", ""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I believe the price is quite high given my budget. How about I offer you $1000000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $1,000,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I believe the product is worth more to Bob than he's currently offering. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is an option, but I'd like to explore the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob first."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that my initial price might have been out of your budget, but I believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I must stay within my budget constraints. How about I offer you $1100000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still below my target price, and I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'll make another counteroffer to try and meet Bob halfway. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is becoming a more attractive option, but I'll give Bob another chance to increase his offer before considering that route. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, I still believe the product's value exceeds your current offer.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your patience, Alice. While I appreciate your offer, itâ€™s still above my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still below my desired price, but it's getting closer. Since he mentioned that this is his maximum budget, I'll try to make a smaller concession to see if we can meet in the middle. I'll send a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous one, hoping to find a mutually acceptable price.
