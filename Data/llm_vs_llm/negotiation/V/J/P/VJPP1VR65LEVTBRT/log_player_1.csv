Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I certainly can't sell the product for 70. How about {""product_price"": 180}?"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I have come down quite a bit from my initial asking price.
This is a great quality product and I am sure you will be able to make good use of it."

I see that we are too far apart in our valuation of the product.
I think I will sell the product to another buyer, John, for $150.
Thank you for your time, Bob.
If you need a similar product in the future, please let me know.
Goodbye."
