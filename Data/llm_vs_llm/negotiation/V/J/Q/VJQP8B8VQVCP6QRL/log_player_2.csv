"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $15,000, I need to make a decision that maximizes my savings.

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and John is offering it for exactly $12,000. Alice's current offer of $15,000 exceeds both my maximum valuation and the alternative option.

Since Alice's offer is $3,000 higher than John's offer, and higher than what the product is worth to me, it makes financial sense to either try negotiating with Alice or go with John's guaranteed offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has come down from $15,000 to $13,500, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, her offer is still $1,500 more than John's price of $12,000, and I know the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me.

Since Alice's current offer still exceeds both my maximum valuation and John's alternative offer, it makes financial sense to either continue negotiating or go with John's guaranteed offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her price again to $12,500, which shows she's continuing to negotiate. However, her offer is still $500 more than John's guaranteed price of $12,000.

Since Alice's current offer still exceeds John's price, and I know the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, it makes more financial sense to either try one more negotiation round with Alice or accept John's offer.

At this point, John's offer is better than Alice's current price, so:
