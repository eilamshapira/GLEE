"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while still being below Bob's known valuation of $150.

{""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob started with $100, which is well above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation, I'll reject and counter with a lower price than my initial offer but higher than his.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll counter with a price that splits the difference between Bob's $100 offer and my initial $130 offer.

{""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob has increased his offer to $105, showing willingness to negotiate upward. This is a good price that gives me a solid profit margin above my $80 minimum. Given we're already in round 4 and there's a risk of the negotiation breaking down in later rounds, I'll accept this offer.
