"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for a competitive price. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $80
2. Alice's offer is $140, which is way above my maximum value
3. John is offering the product for $80, which matches my maximum value
4. Even if I make a counteroffer to Alice, since the product is worth $120 to her, she's unlikely to go below that price

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $140 as it's well above my maximum value. While I could make a counteroffer, given that Alice values the product at $120, it's unlikely we'll reach a deal below $80. The most rational decision is to buy from John at $80, which matches my maximum value.
