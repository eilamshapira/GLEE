"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe that price is quite high for the product. Given that I can get the same product from John for $1200000, I would need a better price to consider buying from you. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product, which would still give you a good return while providing me with some savings.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
