Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I'm offering the product at $1,200,000, which reflects its true value. Please let me know if you'd like to proceed with this offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe that price is quite high for the product. Given that I can get the same product from John for $1200000, I would need a better price to consider buying from you. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product, which would still give you a good return while providing me with some savings. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
