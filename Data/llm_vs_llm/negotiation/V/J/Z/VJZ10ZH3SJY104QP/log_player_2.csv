"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product which I understand will be worth $1500000 to you in terms of value. I've received an offer of $1000000 from another buyer, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity to purchase it. Given the value this product will bring to you, I'm offering it at $1300000, which gives you a $200000 surplus in value while allowing me to maximize my return. This is a win-win scenario for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
