Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 (which I can get from John), and even well below that, I will reject this offer and make a counteroffer. There's no reason to accept an offer that's much lower than my guaranteed alternative.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial price but still maintain a price well above my minimum to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's new offer of $9,000 is still significantly below the $15,000 I can get from John. Since Bob has only increased his offer by $1,000 from his previous offer, and we're still far from reaching an acceptable price, I'll choose to sell to John rather than continue negotiations that don't seem to be progressing meaningfully.
