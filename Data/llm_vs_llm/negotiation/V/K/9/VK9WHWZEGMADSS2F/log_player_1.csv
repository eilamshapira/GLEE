Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, I'll make an offer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","This is a tough spot. $80 is far below my minimum of $150. I could try to get more from Bob, but there's also a chance he'll walk away, and I'll lose the sale. Considering I have other options, I'll choose the best one.
