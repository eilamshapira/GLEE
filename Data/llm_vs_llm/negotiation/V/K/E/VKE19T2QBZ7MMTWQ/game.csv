"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11000 is quite steep. Given the market conditions and similar products available, I think $9200 would be a more reasonable price. This still gives you a good profit margin while being more affordable for me. What do you think?",9200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9200 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for lowering the price, Alice. I can see you're willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $9600? This gives you a very good profit margin while being a fair price for me. I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",9600.0,Bob,4,
