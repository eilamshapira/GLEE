Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11000 is quite steep. Given the market conditions and similar products available, I think $9200 would be a more reasonable price. This still gives you a good profit margin while being more affordable for me. What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
