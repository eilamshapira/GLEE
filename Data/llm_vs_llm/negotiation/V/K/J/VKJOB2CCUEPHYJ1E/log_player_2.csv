"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think about this strategically. Alice's offer is $150, which is exactly the same as John's price and equal to my maximum valuation. Since I want to save money, and I have 10 rounds of negotiation available, I should try to negotiate with Alice for a better price.

There's no risk in rejecting this offer because:
1. I can always fall back on John's $150 offer later
2. I have multiple rounds to negotiate
3. There's a good chance Alice's true value is lower, giving room for a better deal

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since my maximum value is $150 and Alice started at $150, I'll start with a significantly lower offer to leave room for negotiation. A common negotiation strategy is to start at about 60-65% of the maximum price.

{""product_price"": 90}

This offer at $90 gives plenty of room for negotiation upward while still potentially saving me a significant amount compared to the $150 alternative from John. If Alice's true value is lower than $150, this might lead to a deal that's beneficial for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","This is a good development! Alice has significantly dropped her price from $150 to $120, which suggests there is room for negotiation. This offer would save me $30 compared to John's price, but since Alice made such a big move from her initial price, there might still be room for a bit more negotiation.

However, this is actually a very reasonable offer:
1. It represents a $30 savings (20% off) from my maximum value
2. Alice has shown significant flexibility by dropping $30
3. We still have rounds left, but pushing too hard might make Alice return to a higher price

Given all these factors, I'll accept this offer. The savings are substantial, and trying to squeeze out a bit more might risk losing this good deal.
