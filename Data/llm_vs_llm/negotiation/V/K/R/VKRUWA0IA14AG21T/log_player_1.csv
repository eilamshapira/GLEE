Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a reasonable price to offer Bob for the product. 

Since the product is worth at least $120 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, I should offer Bob a price higher than $120.

Without knowing Bob's valuation, I'll aim for a moderate markup that gives me a good profit while still being potentially acceptable to Bob.
