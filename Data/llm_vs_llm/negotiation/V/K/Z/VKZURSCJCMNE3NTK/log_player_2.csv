"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Given that Alice's offer is $1,500,000, which is the same as what John is offering, I need to decide what to do.

The product is worth up to $1,500,000 to me, so either offer is at my maximum acceptable price.

Since Alice's offer ($1,500,000) is exactly the same as John's price ($1,500,000), there's no financial advantage to choosing one over the other. In this case, I could accept either offer.

However, since I've already been in negotiation with Alice, I'll choose to accept her offer rather than starting a new transaction with John.
