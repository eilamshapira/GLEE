"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000 is above my maximum value ($800,000), and equal to her own valuation, it makes sense to reject this offer. I can either try to negotiate for a better price or fall back on John's offer of $800,000 if negotiations don't progress favorably. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 650000}

I'll start with a relatively low offer of $650,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still being a reasonable starting point. It's significantly below John's price of $800,000, which gives me negotiating leverage but isn't so low as to be insulting. Since Alice values the product at $1,000,000, there's potential for us to find a middle ground that works for both parties while staying below my maximum threshold of $800,000."
