"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price, considering the product's worth to me. I'm open to negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand that the product is unique and valuable, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth to me, and I'm willing to negotiate from here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my initial price and even lower than John's offer of $800,000, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate and try to get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must say that $600,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a concession, but I'd like to meet you somewhere in the middle. I'm offering the product to you for $1,000,000. I believe this price is more reasonable, and I'm open to further discussions."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your concession, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit below your offer of $1000000, but I'm willing to meet you at $800000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Although Bob's offer of $800,000 matches John's offer, I will reject it and proceed to the next round. Since I still have 6 rounds left to negotiate, I want to try to get a better price from Bob. If the negotiation doesn't go in my favor, I can always fall back on selling the product to John for $800,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I see that we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not entirely comfortable with $800,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I'd like to try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm offering the product to you for $950,000. I believe this price is more reasonable, considering the product's value and the progress we've made in our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest concession, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current one. I'm offering $875000 for the product. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Considering Bob's offer of $875,000 is higher than John's offer of $800,000, and we've already had several rounds of negotiation, I think it's a good idea to accept Bob's offer. The difference between $875,000 and $950,000 (my previous offer) is not significant enough to warrant further negotiation, and there's a risk that Bob might not be willing to go higher. Accepting the offer now ensures a better outcome than selling to John."
