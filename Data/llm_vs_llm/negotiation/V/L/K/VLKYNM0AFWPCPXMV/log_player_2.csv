(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer is $975,000 and she mentioned it's her final offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept it or not. Considering that I'm trying to save as much money as possible, but also wanting to buy the product, I'll think about the fact that Alice's reservation price is $800,000, and she's already gone up to $975,000. I'm close to my maximum budget of $1,200,000, and buying from John would cost me even more.
