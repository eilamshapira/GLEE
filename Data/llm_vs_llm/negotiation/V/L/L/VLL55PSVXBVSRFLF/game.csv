"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $800000 is below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $1800000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the value this product can bring justifies a higher investment. I'm willing to lower the price to $1600000. What are your thoughts on this?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1600000 is still too high for me. I can go up to $900000. Is that something you can work with?",900000.0,Bob,4,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your position, $900000 is still below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to reduce the price further to $1400000. Let me know if this works for you.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the reduction. However, $1300000 is still above what I'm willing to spend. I can increase my offer to $950000. Can we meet in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,6,
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to increase your offer, but $950000 is still not feasible for me. I'm willing to go down to $1250000, which is very close to my minimum. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",,Alice,6,RejectOffer

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but it's still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975000. This is my best offer. Can we make a deal at this price?",975000.0,Bob,8,
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but $975000 is still below my minimum. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to purchase the product for $1200000. I will be selling to him. Thank you for your interest.",,Alice,8,SellToJhon
