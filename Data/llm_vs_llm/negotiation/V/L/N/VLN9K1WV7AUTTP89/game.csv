"Hi Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $20000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $5000 for it. Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but $5000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to counteroffer at $18000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $18000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $7000. I think this is a fair compromise given my budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid to $7000. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $12000, which I believe is a reasonable price considering the product's value and our negotiation so far.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $8500. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my financial limits. Let me know if this works for you.",8500.0,Bob,6,
