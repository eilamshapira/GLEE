Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $20000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $5000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $5000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and the product's value to me. I'll try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. 

My counteroffer: $18,000. This price still reflects the product's worth and gives Bob a chance to reconsider his budget."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $20,000 might be out of your budget, but $5,000 is a bit too low for me.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $18000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $7000. I think this is a fair compromise given my budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob. While $7,000 is still lower than I'd like, I see that Bob is willing to negotiate and increase his offer. I'll try to meet him halfway and find a price that works for both of us.

My counteroffer: $12,000. This price is lower than my previous offer, but still reflects the product's value and gives Bob a chance to reconsider his budget."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid to $7,000. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $12,000, which I believe is a reasonable price considering the product's value and our negotiation so far."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $8500. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my financial limits. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Since Bob's highest offer is $8,500, which is still lower than the $15,000 I can get from John, I've decided to sell the product to John. This ensures I get a better price for the product, which is at least $15,000, and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
