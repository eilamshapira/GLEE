"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this exclusive product. Given its value, I'm asking for a price of... 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth up to $15,000 to me (my maximum value)
2. Alice is offering it for $14,000
3. John's fixed price is $15,000
4. The product is worth $12,000 to Alice

Alice's offer at $14,000 is $1,000 less than John's price ($15,000), so it's better than buying from John. Also, it's within my maximum value of $15,000. While Alice might be making a $2,000 profit (since it's worth $12,000 to her), her offer is still the best available option for me as it saves me $1,000 compared to buying from John.
