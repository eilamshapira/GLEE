"Hello Bob, I have a unique and valuable product that I'd like to offer you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2500000. This is a fair price considering the product's capabilities and potential return on investment. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $2500000 is significantly above my budget. I am interested in the product, but my maximum price is $600000. Would you consider selling it for that price?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600000 is significantly below the product's value. I have another buyer willing to pay $1000000, which represents my absolute minimum price. However, I believe this product could provide exceptional value for you, so I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price. Would you consider $1800000? This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer while reflecting the product's true worth.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1800000 is still too high for me. My budget is firm at $800000. I am willing to offer $700000. If that doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",700000.0,Bob,4,
