"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique and valuable product that I'd like to offer you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,500,000. This is a fair price considering the product's capabilities and potential return on investment. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $2500000 is significantly above my budget. I am interested in the product, but my maximum price is $600000. Would you consider selling it for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $600,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and since I have John's guaranteed offer at $1,000,000, I won't accept anything lower than that. However, I believe Bob might be willing to negotiate to a higher price, so I'll continue the negotiation rather than immediately selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is significantly below the product's value. I have another buyer willing to pay $1,000,000, which represents my absolute minimum price. However, I believe this product could provide exceptional value for you, so I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price. Would you consider $1,800,000? This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer while reflecting the product's true worth."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1800000 is still too high for me. My budget is firm at $800000. I am willing to offer $700000. If that doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob has indicated that his budget is firm at $800,000, which is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and his latest offer is even lower at $700,000, it's best to take John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000. It's clear that Bob and I have too large a gap in our price expectations to reach a mutually acceptable deal."
