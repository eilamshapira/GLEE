"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product but I can only offer $8000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $8000 is below our minimum threshold for this product. I'm willing to come down to $11000, considering your budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you.",11000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11000 might still be a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? This is the lowest I can go while still valuing the product appropriately. Let me know if this works for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $9000. It's a fair price that's within my budget. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is still below our minimum. I can go down to $10200, which is a significant discount from our original price. Let me know if this is something you can work with.",10200.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer, but I need to stick to a price that reflects the value of the product. How about $10100? This is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you.",10100.0,Alice,5,
