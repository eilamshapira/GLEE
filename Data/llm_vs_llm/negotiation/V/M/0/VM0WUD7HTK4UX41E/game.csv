"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $150 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend. I've seen similar products for much less. I'd be willing to pay $70 for it. Let me know if this works for you.",70.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $70 is a bit too low for me. I can offer you a better price than my initial offer, though. I'd be willing to sell it to you for $130. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",130.0,Alice,3,
