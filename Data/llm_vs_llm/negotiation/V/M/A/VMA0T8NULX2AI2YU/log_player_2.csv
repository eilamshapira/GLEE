"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to purchase this exceptional product. It's a rare find and I'm offering it to you at a competitive price. I'm sure you'll find it to be a valuable investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: Since Alice is offering the product at exactly the same price as John ($1,500,000), it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice for a better price. By making a counteroffer, we might be able to get the product for less than $1,500,000. We always have the option to buy from John later if negotiations with Alice don't go well, so there's no risk in trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, I notice your price matches what I can get elsewhere in the market. Given that, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This would make it a more attractive proposition for me while still representing fair value for the product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Reasoning: I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer ($1,100,000) because:
1. We know our maximum value is $1,500,000
2. We have John's offer as a backup at $1,500,000
3. Starting lower gives us room to negotiate upward if needed
4. The price difference is significant enough to make Alice consider it, but not so low as to be offensive
5. We're maintaining a professional and respectful tone while explaining our position"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and I'm keen to make this deal work for both of us. Given the unique value and potential this product holds, I'd like to propose a price of $1400000. I believe this reflects the quality and benefits you're getting, while still being competitive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing her price from $1,500,000 to $1,400,000, which is a positive sign. Since we still have John's offer as a backup at $1,500,000, and Alice has demonstrated flexibility, it's worth making another counteroffer. We might be able to get an even better price, and we can always fall back to either Alice's current offer or John's offer if needed. Let's continue negotiating to try to find a middle ground between our $1,100,000 offer and Alice's $1,400,000 counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your willingness to negotiate shows we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Given the current market conditions and considering our previous offers, I'd like to propose meeting in the middle at $1,250,000. This represents a fair compromise between our positions while still reflecting the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Reasoning: I'm proposing $1,250,000 because:
1. It's approximately halfway between our last offer ($1,100,000) and Alice's current offer ($1,400,000)
2. It represents a significant savings from John's price of $1,500,000
3. The counteroffer shows we're willing to move up substantially from our initial position
4. It leaves some room for further negotiation if needed
5. The price point is reasonable enough that it might be acceptable to Alice while still giving us a good deal
6. We maintain a professional and collaborative tone, acknowledging Alice's movement on price"
