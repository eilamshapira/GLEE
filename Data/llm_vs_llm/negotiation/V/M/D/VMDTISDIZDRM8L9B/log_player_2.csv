"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me think about this:
1. Alice's offer is $110
2. My maximum value is $120
3. John's fixed price is $120
4. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate

Alice's offer of $110 is less than both my maximum value and John's price, but I believe I can negotiate for a better price since I know the product is worth $80 to Alice. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $80 to Alice and I know she can still make a profit above that price, I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but gives me more savings. I'll start with a price closer to Alice's cost but not too low to be immediately rejected.

{""product_price"": 90}

This offer would give Alice a $10 profit while saving me $30 compared to her initial offer and $30 compared to John's price. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:
1. Alice has lowered her price from $110 to $105
2. This shows she's willing to negotiate and move downward
3. I still have 7 more rounds to negotiate
4. Her new offer is $15 less than John's price
5. She moved down $5, after I tried to move down $20

Since Alice is showing flexibility and we still have several rounds left, I believe there's still room for negotiation to get a better price. The downward movement suggests we can meet at a lower price point.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down $5 from her initial offer, I'll also show some flexibility by increasing my previous offer of $90. I'll try to meet somewhere in the middle, but still aiming for a good deal.

{""product_price"": 95}

This offer:
1. Shows I'm willing to move up from my initial offer
2. Still gives Alice a $15 profit margin from her cost ($80)
3. Would save me $25 compared to John's price
4. Leaves room for further negotiation if needed
5. Represents a reasonable middle ground between our last positions ($90 and $105)"
