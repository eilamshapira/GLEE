"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer ($2,000,000) is higher than both my maximum value ($1,500,000) and John's price ($1,500,000), I should not accept Alice's offer. The best option would be to buy from John at $1,500,000.
