"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Looking at the options here:

Option 1: Accept Alice's offer and pay $200
Option 2: Reject Alice's offer
Option 3: Buy from John for $100

Since the product is only worth $100 to me at maximum, and John is selling it for exactly $100, Alice's offer of $200 is clearly not a good deal. It would cost me twice as much as the product is worth to me.

The logical choice is to reject Alice's offer and buy from John instead.
