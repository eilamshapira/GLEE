"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a premium product that I'm offering to you. I believe it would be a great addition for you, considering its quality and value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $12,000
2. Alice is offering the product for $10,000
3. John's fixed price is $12,000

Since Alice's offer ($10,000) is:
- Below my maximum value ($12,000)
- Less than John's price ($12,000)
- Would save me $2,000 compared to buying from John

This is a good deal that would save me money while still getting the product I want.
