Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2500000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $600000, considering the product's potential value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go that low. How about $2,300,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $2300000 is still above what I'm willing to pay. I'm serious about acquiring the product, and I'm willing to increase my previous offer. I'll meet you halfway between my initial offer and your current price isn't feasible, but I can offer $800000, which I believe is a reasonable step forward.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate you coming up a bit, $800,000 still doesn't reflect the true value. I'm going to need to see a more significant increase to move forward. Considering the product's potential, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle and lower the price to $2,100,000. This is the lowest I can go while still valuing the product appropriately."", ""product_price"": 2100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to lower the price, but $2100000 is still beyond my budget. I've been considering the product's value and our previous discussions. I'm willing to make a more significant increase in my offer to demonstrate my commitment to acquiring the product. I'll offer $900000, which I believe is a substantial step forward and closer to a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, one more try. Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your efforts, $900,000 still doesn't come close to representing the value of this product. I'm willing to offer a final price of $2,000,000. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I may need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're reaching the limit of your flexibility, and I appreciate the efforts you've made so far. However, $2000000 is still above what I'm willing to pay. Considering your hint at considering other options, I'm willing to make one more significant increase in my offer to try and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
