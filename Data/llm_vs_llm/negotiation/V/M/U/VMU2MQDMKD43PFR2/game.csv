"Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product today. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1800000. This product represents a significant opportunity with substantial potential returns. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has potential, the price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $500000 for it.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $500000 is significantly below its true value. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. Given the product's quality and potential, I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This is still a very competitive price considering what this product can deliver for you.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  I can increase my offer to $700000.  This offer reflects a serious interest on my end while acknowledging the price needs to work for me.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $700000, which shows your genuine interest in the product. However, I need to be transparent that I have a standing offer from another buyer for $1000000. While I'd prefer to work with you, I can't accept less than what I know the product is worth. My best offer is $1300000, which I believe still represents excellent value given the product's potential return on investment. Can we find a middle ground that works for both of us?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try to find that middle ground.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1000000? That seems like a fair price that recognizes the product's value while working within my constraints.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
