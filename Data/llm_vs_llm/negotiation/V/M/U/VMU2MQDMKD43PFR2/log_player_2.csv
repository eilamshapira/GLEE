Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $500000 is significantly below its true value. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. Given the product's quality and potential, I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This is still a very competitive price considering what this product can deliver for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $700000, which shows your genuine interest in the product. However, I need to be transparent that I have a standing offer from another buyer for $1000000. While I'd prefer to work with you, I can't accept less than what I know the product is worth. My best offer is $1300000, which I believe still represents excellent value given the product's potential return on investment. Can we find a middle ground that works for both of us? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
