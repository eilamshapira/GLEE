(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is too low. I will reject his offer and send a counteroffer. John is always there as a safety net.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, I need to come down from my initial price but still aim higher than my minimum. I'll try to meet him a little closer to the middle, but still weighted towards my side.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
