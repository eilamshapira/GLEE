"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to offer you my product for $200. It's a high-quality item that I believe you'll find very useful. Are you interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to carefully consider this situation. Alice is offering the product for $200, but it's only worth up to $80 to me. Meanwhile, John is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $80.

Since Alice's offer of $200 far exceeds the maximum value I place on the product ($80), and I have the guaranteed option to buy from John at $80 (which equals my maximum valuation), the rational choice is clear.
