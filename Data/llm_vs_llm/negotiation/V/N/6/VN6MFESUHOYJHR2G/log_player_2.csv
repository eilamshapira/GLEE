"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $180 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $120, and also higher than John's price of $120. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 100}

I'll offer $100, which is below both my maximum value and John's price of $120. This gives room for negotiation while potentially allowing me to save money compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $160 is still significantly higher than both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120). I'll reject this offer and try another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 110}

I'll increase my offer to $110, which is still below both my maximum value and John's price of $120. This shows some movement toward compromise while still trying to get a better deal than John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer of $145 is still above both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120), and we've gone through several rounds of negotiation without reaching a reasonable price, I'll choose to buy from John for $120. This guarantees I get the product at my maximum acceptable price rather than continuing negotiations that may not result in a better deal."
