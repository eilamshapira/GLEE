"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the quality of your product, but $115 is quite close to what I can get it for elsewhere. Since I'm looking to get good value, I would be comfortable paying $90 for the product. This gives you a decent profit while allowing me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. Considering the quality and the value of the product, I'm willing to offer it at $105. I believe this price reflects a fair balance between value and quality. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to discuss further.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $105. However, I've been comparing similar products in the market, and I'm looking at a budget closer to $95. This would still give you a good profit margin while helping me stay within my spending limit. Would you be able to meet me at this price point?",95.0,Bob,4,
