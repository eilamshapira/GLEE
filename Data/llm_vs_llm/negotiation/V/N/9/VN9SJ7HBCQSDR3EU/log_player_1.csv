Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the quality of your product, but $115 is quite close to what I can get it for elsewhere. Since I'm looking to get good value, I would be comfortable paying $90 for the product. This gives you a decent profit while allowing me to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $105. However, I've been comparing similar products in the market, and I'm looking at a budget closer to $95. This would still give you a good profit margin while helping me stay within my spending limit. Would you be able to meet me at this price point?
