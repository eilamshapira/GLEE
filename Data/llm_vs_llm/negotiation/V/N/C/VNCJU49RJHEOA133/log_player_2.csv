"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price of $1,300,000 is quite high, considering that the product is worth $800,000 to Alice. Since my maximum budget is $1,500,000, I still have room to negotiate for a better price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. Buying from John at $1,500,000 would be my last resort since it's the highest price option."

I'll offer $950,000, which is significantly higher than Alice's cost ($800,000) but much lower than her initial offer. This gives Alice a reasonable profit margin of $150,000 (about 19% profit) while still saving me a considerable amount compared to both her initial offer and John's price. This leaves room for further negotiation if needed, but represents a fair starting point that acknowledges both parties' interests."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has lowered her price by $100,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still quite high. Since she dropped her price from the initial offer, there's likely still room for negotiation. The current price is still $400,000 above her cost ($800,000). I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer. We're moving in the right direction, and there's no need to accept yet or resort to John's much higher price of $1,500,000."

I'll increase my previous offer to $1,050,000, which moves significantly toward Alice's position while still maintaining a good price for myself. This offer would give Alice a healthy profit of $250,000 (about 31% profit margin) while being $150,000 less than her last offer. It shows I'm willing to be reasonable and move substantially from my initial position, which should encourage further negotiation. This price is also significantly better than John's alternative of $1,500,000, so I still have room to negotiate if needed."
