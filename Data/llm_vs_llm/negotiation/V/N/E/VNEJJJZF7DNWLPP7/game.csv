"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your offer. While I recognize the potential value, $20000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $5000.  This represents a fair price considering the market and my valuation of the product's utility.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but $5000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I believe my product has a higher value, and I'd like to propose a counteroffer.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15000 remains considerably higher than my initial offer. I can increase my offer to $7500. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that reflects both the product's value and my budgetary constraints. Let me know your thoughts.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for increasing your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $7500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm trying to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $12000. This price reflects the product's value and takes into account your budgetary concerns.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I understand you're aiming for a higher price, but $12000 still stretches my budget. I'm willing to move to $9000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my serious interest in acquiring the product.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider my alternative options.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your increased offer, Bob. I appreciate your serious interest in the product. However, $9000 is still a bit short of my expectations. Considering your previous messages, I sense that you're willing to pay a premium for the product. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10500. This price reflects the product's value and takes into account your enthusiasm for acquiring it.",10500.0,Alice,7,
