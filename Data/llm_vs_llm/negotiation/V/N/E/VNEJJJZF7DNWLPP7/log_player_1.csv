Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your offer. While I recognize the potential value, $20000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $5000.  This represents a fair price considering the market and my valuation of the product's utility.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $5,000 because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll proceed to the next round to send a counteroffer, hoping to find a mutually agreeable price."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15000 remains considerably higher than my initial offer. I can increase my offer to $7500.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I understand you're aiming for a higher price, but $12000 still stretches my budget. I'm willing to move to $9000.

I reject Bob's offer of $9,000. Although he's getting closer to my target price, I still believe the product is worth more.
