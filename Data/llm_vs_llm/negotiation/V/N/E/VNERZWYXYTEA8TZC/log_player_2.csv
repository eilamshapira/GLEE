"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than the product's worth to me (no more than $800,000) and also higher than John's guaranteed price of $800,000. There's no reason to pay more than the product is worth to me, especially when I have a guaranteed alternative at the maximum value I place on the product.
