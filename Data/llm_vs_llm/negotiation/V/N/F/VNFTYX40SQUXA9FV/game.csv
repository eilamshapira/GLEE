"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $1400000 is quite steep. Given that I have alternative options available, I'd like to propose $1150000. This still provides you with a substantial profit margin while being more reasonable for my budget. What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1150000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1250000?  That's still a significant profit for you, and a fair price for me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
