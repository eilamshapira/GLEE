"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $1400000 is quite steep. Given that I have alternative options available, I'd like to propose $1150000. This still provides you with a substantial profit margin while being more reasonable for my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
