"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth up to $1,500,000 to me (my maximum value)
2. Alice's cost is $1,000,000
3. Alice is offering $1,400,000
4. John's fixed price is $1,500,000

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than John's price of $1,500,000, but there might be room for negotiation since Alice's cost is $1,000,000. It would be reasonable to try to negotiate for a better price since there's a $400,000 gap between Alice's cost and her current offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's $1,400,000 but still provides her with a good profit margin above her $1,000,000 cost.

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,400,000 is quite steep. Given that I have alternative options available, I'd like to propose $1,150,000. This still provides you with a substantial profit margin while being more reasonable for my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1150000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1250000?  That's still a significant profit for you, and a fair price for me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:

1. Alice has reduced her price from $1,400,000 to $1,250,000
2. This is a significant reduction ($150,000 less)
3. The price is still $250,000 lower than John's price
4. The offer provides Alice with a $250,000 profit (from her $1,000,000 cost)
5. There might still be room for negotiation, but Alice has made a substantial concession

This is actually a pretty good offer. While there might be room for further negotiation, the risk is that Alice might increase her price if we continue negotiating, and we already have a price that's significantly better than our alternative with John. The $1,250,000 price point represents a fair deal for both parties.
