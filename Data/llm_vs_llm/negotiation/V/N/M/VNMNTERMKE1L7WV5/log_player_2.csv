"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I believe could greatly benefit you. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
2. Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $800,000

The logical choice is to buy from John since:
- Alice's price ($1,200,000) is well above my maximum value ($800,000)
- John's price ($800,000) matches my maximum value
- I would be overpaying by $400,000 if I accepted Alice's offer
