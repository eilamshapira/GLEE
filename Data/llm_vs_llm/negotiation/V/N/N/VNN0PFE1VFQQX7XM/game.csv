"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit above my budget. I can offer you $60 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $60, I'm afraid that's below what I can accept for this item. The product is worth at least $80 to me, and I have another buyer (John) who is willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to sell it to you if we can reach a fair agreement. Could you consider $100? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer.",100.0,Alice,3,
