Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit above my budget. I can offer you $60 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $60, I'm afraid that's below what I can accept for this item. The product is worth at least $80 to me, and I have another buyer (John) who is willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to sell it to you if we can reach a fair agreement. Could you consider $100? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 100}"
