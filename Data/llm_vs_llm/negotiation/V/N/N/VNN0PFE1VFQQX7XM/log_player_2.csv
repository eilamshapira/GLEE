Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $60, I'm afraid that's below what I can accept for this item. The product is worth at least $80 to me, and I have another buyer (John) who is willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to sell it to you if we can reach a fair agreement. Could you consider $100? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer.
