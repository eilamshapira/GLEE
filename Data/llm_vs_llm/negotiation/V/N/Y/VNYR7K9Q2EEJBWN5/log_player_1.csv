Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make a strategic decision here. Since I know the product is worth at least $120 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, I should set a price for Bob that's higher than $120.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll set a price that gives me a good margin above my minimum while still being potentially attractive to a buyer.
