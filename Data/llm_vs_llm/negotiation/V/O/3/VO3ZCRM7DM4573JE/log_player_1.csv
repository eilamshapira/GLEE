Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 12000}

I'll start with a relatively high price to allow room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. Since I don't know Bob's maximum value for the product, this opening offer will help gauge his interest and willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I reject Bob's offer of $6,000 because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, lowering my initial price somewhat but still keeping it well above my minimum threshold. Since I always have the option to sell to John for $8,000, I won't accept any offer below that amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm lowering my price from the initial $12,000 to $10,000 to show willingness to negotiate while maintaining a good margin above my minimum price of $8,000. This demonstrates flexibility but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed. If Bob continues to offer below $8,000, I can always fall back on John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer of $7,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and his increase from $6,000 to $7,000 suggests he may not be willing to go much higher, I'll take the guaranteed $8,000 from John. This ensures I get my minimum price rather than risk further negotiations that might not reach an acceptable level. It's a safer choice that meets my financial requirements."
