"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $19,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative offer ($8,000). It would be illogical to accept this offer. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to negotiate a better price with Alice, knowing I always have John's $8,000 offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 6000}

I'll make a counteroffer of $6,000. This is below my maximum value of $8,000 and below John's alternative offer, giving me room to negotiate upward if necessary. Since Alice's initial offer was very high ($19,000), I'm starting relatively low to leave room for negotiation while still making a reasonable offer that could potentially be profitable for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $17,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative offer ($8,000). While Alice has reduced the price from her initial offer, it's still more than double what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round. If Alice continues to make offers well above my maximum value, I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 6500}

I'll slightly increase my previous offer to $6,500. This shows some willingness to negotiate and move upward, while still staying well below my maximum value of $8,000 and John's alternative offer. Alice's last offer was still very high at $17,000, but she did come down by $2,000, showing some flexibility. My modest increase signals that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't be moving up to anywhere near her asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still substantially higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative offer ($8,000). While Alice continues to lower her price (now down $4,000 from initial offer), she's still asking for nearly double my maximum value. Since we're halfway through our negotiation rounds and Alice's offers are still far above my acceptable range, I'll reject and make another counteroffer. However, if Alice's offers don't come down significantly in the next few rounds, I may need to consider taking John's offer of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 7000}

I'll increase my offer to $7,000. Alice has shown a pattern of gradually reducing her price ($19,000 → $17,000 → $15,000), but we're still far apart. By raising my offer to $7,000, I'm showing continued willingness to negotiate while staying below both my maximum value and John's price. With only a few rounds remaining, I'm making a more substantial move upward to try to reach an agreement. However, if Alice doesn't come down significantly in her next offer, I might need to seriously consider taking John's $8,000 offer in the next rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John for $8,000. Here's why:

1. Alice's price ($13,000) is still significantly above my maximum value ($8,000)
2. While Alice has been steadily decreasing her price, the rate of decrease suggests she won't reach $8,000 or below in the remaining rounds
3. We've gone through 7 rounds already, and we're still $5,000 apart
4. John's offer of $8,000 is at my maximum value point
5. There's a risk in continuing negotiation as we might run out of rounds without reaching an agreement

Given these factors, it's most rational to take the guaranteed option of buying from John rather than risking further rounds with Alice when her price is still too high."
