"Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for $150. It's a high-quality item and I believe it's well worth the price. Let me know what you think.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $150 is much higher than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know I can purchase the same item elsewhere for $80. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if we can agree on a reasonable price. Would you consider $60 for the product? This would save me the trouble of going elsewhere and give you a sale today.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $60 is too low for me. I am willing to come down a bit, how about $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $130 is still well above what I can pay. As I mentioned, I have an option to purchase this exact product for $80 elsewhere. However, I'd like to do business with you if possible. I can offer $70, which would save me a trip to the other store and give you a customer today. How does that sound?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, $70 is below my minimum acceptable price. I can come down to $110. That's the lowest I can go.",110.0,Alice,5,
