Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $150 is much higher than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know I can purchase the same item elsewhere for $80. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if we can agree on a reasonable price. Would you consider $60 for the product? This would save me the trouble of going elsewhere and give you a sale today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $130 is still well above what I can pay. As I mentioned, I have an option to purchase this exact product for $80 elsewhere.
