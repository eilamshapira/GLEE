"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for $150. It's a high-quality item and I believe it's well worth the price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $150, which is significantly higher than my maximum valuation of $80. Additionally, I know I can buy the same product from John for $80, which is my reservation price.

There's no reason for me to accept Alice's current offer when I have a guaranteed option at my maximum acceptable price. Since I can always buy from John at $80, I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $150 is much higher than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know I can purchase the same item elsewhere for $80. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if we can agree on a reasonable price. Would you consider $60 for the product? This would save me the trouble of going elsewhere and give you a sale today."", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $60 is too low for me. I am willing to come down a bit, how about $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has reduced her price from $150 to $130, which shows some willingness to negotiate. However, this is still significantly higher than my maximum valuation of $80, and higher than John's price of $80. Since I can buy the same product from John for $80, there's no reason for me to accept a price above that amount.

I'll reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price below $80, which would be beneficial for me.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $130 is still well above what I can pay. As I mentioned, I have an option to purchase this exact product for $80 elsewhere. However, I'd like to do business with you if possible. I can offer $70, which would save me a trip to the other store and give you a customer today. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. However, $70 is below my minimum acceptable price. I can come down to $110. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has lowered her price to $110, but this is still above both my maximum valuation of $80 and John's offer of $80. 

Since Alice claims $110 is the lowest she can go, and this is still significantly higher than my alternative option, it makes the most sense to buy from John at $80.
