"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its exceptional worth, I'm willing to sell it to you for a price that reflects its value to both of us. I believe this is a fair offer, considering the product's significance. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Alice's offer is below John's price, it's still significantly higher than her own valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, we might be able to get Alice to come down closer to a price that reflects a more even split of the difference between your valuations."
