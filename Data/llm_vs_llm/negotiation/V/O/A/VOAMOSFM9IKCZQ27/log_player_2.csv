"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm offering this product to you at a price of $200. Let me know if you're interested in making a purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to consider my options carefully here:

1. Alice is offering the product for $200
2. The product is worth no more than $100 to me
3. I can buy the same product from John for $100

Since the product is only worth $100 to me, and Alice's price ($200) exceeds what I value the product at, it doesn't make sense to accept her offer. John's price ($100) matches exactly what the product is worth to me, so that's the better option.
