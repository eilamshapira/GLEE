"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $950000. This is a great opportunity to acquire something that will bring significant value to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's offer is $950,000
2. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me
3. John's fixed price is $1,000,000
4. Alice's cost is $800,000, so there's room for negotiation
5. We have 10 rounds total, so there's no rush to accept this first offer

Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is better than John's price ($1,000,000), but it's still quite high considering Alice's cost is $800,000. Since we have plenty of rounds left to negotiate and there's a significant gap between Alice's cost and her asking price, it makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but still gives me room for negotiation. Since Alice's cost is $800,000 and she started at $950,000, I'll propose a price closer to the middle ground but slightly in my favor.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $950,000 is quite high considering market conditions. I'm interested in the product, but I would be comfortable paying $850,000, which I believe is a fair price that would still provide you with a good profit margin."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. Given its value to you, I'm willing to adjust my offer further. How about we settle at $900000? This price reflects a significant discount while still recognizing the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let's analyze the current situation:

1. Alice has moved down from $950,000 to $900,000 (a $50,000 reduction)
2. This shows she's willing to negotiate
3. We moved from $850,000 to her $900,000 - we're getting closer
4. We still have 7 more rounds possible
5. The $900,000 is well below John's price of $1,000,000
6. However, given Alice's cost of $800,000, there's still room for negotiation

Since Alice showed willingness to reduce her price and we still have several rounds left, it makes sense to continue negotiating. Her movement of $50,000 suggests we might be able to meet somewhere in the middle between $850,000 and $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down $50,000 from her initial offer (from $950,000 to $900,000), I'll show similar flexibility by moving up from my initial offer of $850,000. A reasonable next step would be to meet closer to the middle, but still maintaining some room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. Your product is valuable, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I can increase my offer to $870,000, which represents a significant step up from my previous offer. This price would work well for both of us, providing you with a healthy profit margin while meeting my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 870000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer to an agreement. To further facilitate this, I'm willing to lower the price to $880000. This offer reflects a significant concession on my part, considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let's analyze the current situation:

1. The negotiation has progressed well:
   - Alice: $950k → $900k → $880k
   - Me: $850k → $870k
2. We're now only $10,000 apart ($870k vs $880k)
3. Alice has consistently shown willingness to negotiate
4. The current price of $880k is significantly better than John's $1M
5. We've used 5 rounds, with 5 more remaining
6. The gap is now very small relative to the total price

Given that we're only $10,000 apart, and Alice has made consistent good-faith moves to reach an agreement, it makes sense to accept this offer. Continuing to negotiate over such a small difference might risk souring the deal, and the current price represents a good value compared to both Alice's initial offer and John's alternative.
