Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer ($60) is below my minimum acceptable price ($80), and I have John's guaranteed offer of $80, there's no reason to accept this low offer. However, I'll reject and make a counteroffer rather than immediately selling to John, as there's still potential to get a better price from Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial price significantly but still maintain a price well above my minimum threshold of $80.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer of $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80, and I have a guaranteed offer from John for $80. Since we've already gone through several rounds and Bob's offers are still below my minimum threshold, I'll take the guaranteed $80 from John rather than risk further negotiations that might not improve.
