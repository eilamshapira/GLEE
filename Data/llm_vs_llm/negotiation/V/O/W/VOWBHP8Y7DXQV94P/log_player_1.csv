Send your offer to Bob.,"Based on the information provided, I need to make an offer to Bob for a product that's worth at least $120 to me, while being mindful that it's only worth $80 to Bob.

Since I can always sell the product to John for $120, that's my guaranteed fallback option. However, I'll try to negotiate with Bob first.

Given that Bob values the product at $80, he won't accept any offer above that amount. However, I can't accept less than $120 without losing value compared to my alternative option with John.
