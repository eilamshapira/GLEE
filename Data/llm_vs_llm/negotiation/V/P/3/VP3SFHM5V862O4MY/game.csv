"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $1300000 is still significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to come down slightly. How about we meet at $1800000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1800000 is still quite high for me. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $1400000, which I believe is a fair price considering the market and my budget constraints. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
