Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that I know the product is worth $8,000 to Bob and I can always sell it to John for $12,000, I should start with a high offer to see if Bob might accept a price that gives me more profit than John's offer.

{""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $7,000 is well below both my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and John's guaranteed offer ($12,000), there's no reason to accept it. I could make a counteroffer, but since Bob's initial offer is so low and he already knows my initial high offer wasn't acceptable to him, it suggests he's not likely to reach a price point that would be better than John's offer. The most rational decision is to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John.
