"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1100000 is significantly above my budget. Given that I have another option available at $800000, I would need a much more competitive price. I can offer $850000, which I believe is fair considering the market conditions.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your prompt response and for sharing your concerns about the price. I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, and I'm glad you see the value in the product. However, I must consider the product's worth to me, which is significantly higher than $850000. I'm willing to make a concession to meet you halfway between your offer and my initial price. I can offer the product to you for $975000, which I believe is a fair compromise.",975000.0,Alice,3,
