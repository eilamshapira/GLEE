Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your prompt response and for sharing your concerns about the price. I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, and I'm glad you see the value in the product. However, I must consider the product's worth to me, which is significantly higher than $850000. I'm willing to make a concession to meet you halfway between your offer and my initial price. I can offer the product to you for $975000, which I believe is a fair compromise.
