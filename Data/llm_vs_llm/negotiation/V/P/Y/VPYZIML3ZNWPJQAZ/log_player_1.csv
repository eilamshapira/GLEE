"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $17,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, and I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $17000 is far beyond my budget. Considering my constraints, I'm prepared to offer $7000 for it. I believe this is a fair starting point given the current market alternatives. Looking forward to your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $7,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I still have a chance to negotiate a better price with Bob, and if that doesn't work out, I have the option to sell to John for $15,000. 

My next offer will be: 
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is below my expectations. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a concession and offer it to you for $16,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, and I'm open to further negotiations."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is below my expectations.
