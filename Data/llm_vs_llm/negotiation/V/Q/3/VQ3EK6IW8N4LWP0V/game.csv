"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its market value and potential, I'm offering it at $950000. This price reflects the product's quality and value proposition.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 is a bit high for me. Given my research and the product's current market value, I'm willing to pay $850000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer of $850000, but that's still below what I believe is fair value for this product. Given its proven market value and the benefits it will bring to your business, I can come down to $920000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true worth.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $920000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $880000, which I believe is a fair price considering the market value and our previous discussions. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",880000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're making progress in our negotiation. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $880000. Given that we're both working toward a mutually beneficial agreement, I can reduce my price to $900000. This is a very competitive offer considering the product's value to your business, and it represents a significant reduction from our starting point.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility, but $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you at $890000.  This offer reflects a fair compromise and a potential win-win for both of us. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement on this final number.",890000.0,Bob,6,
