"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its market value and potential, I'm offering it at $950,000. This price reflects the product's quality and value proposition."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 is a bit high for me. Given my research and the product's current market value, I'm willing to pay $850000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. While $850,000 is above my minimum threshold, there's still room for negotiation given that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer of $850,000, but that's still below what I believe is fair value for this product. Given its proven market value and the benefits it will bring to your business, I can come down to $920,000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true worth."", ""product_price"": 920000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $920000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $880000, which I believe is a fair price considering the market value and our previous discussions. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make another counteroffer. Bob has shown willingness to increase his offer, and we're getting closer to a good middle ground. Given that he's moved up $30,000 from his last offer, there's still potential for reaching a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're making progress in our negotiation. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $880,000. Given that we're both working toward a mutually beneficial agreement, I can reduce my price to $900,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the product's value to your business, and it represents a significant reduction from our starting point."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility, but $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you at $890000.  This offer reflects a fair compromise and a potential win-win for both of us. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement on this final number. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $890,000. This is a good compromise that represents a significant improvement over John's standing offer of $800,000. Given that we're already in round 6, and Bob has shown consistent willingness to negotiate but with smaller increments, this is likely the best price we'll achieve without risking the deal falling through."
