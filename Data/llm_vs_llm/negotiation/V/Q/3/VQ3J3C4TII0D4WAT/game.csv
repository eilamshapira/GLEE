"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $400000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. This product offers substantial long-term returns that justify a higher investment.  Would you consider $1200000? This reflects its value while acknowledging your interest.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
