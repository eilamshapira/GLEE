"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'm looking to sell. Based on its features and market value, I'm offering it to you for $18500. This product has excellent potential for return on investment and I believe it would be a valuable asset for you. What do you think?",18500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, your asking price of $18500 is quite high for my budget. I've done some market research, and I believe a fair price would be $12000. This takes into account current market conditions and similar products available. Would you consider this offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand budget considerations, but I must account for the product's true value. After considering your offer, I can come down to $16000. This product has exceptional quality and features that justify this price point, and it represents a significant reduction from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges your budget concerns while reflecting the product's genuine value.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16000 is still above my budget. I've found similar products in the market for lower prices. I can increase my offer to $13500, which I believe is a fair price that better reflects the current market conditions. Would this work for you?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your continued interest in the product. While you mention similar products at lower prices, I want to emphasize that this particular item has superior features and durability compared to alternatives on the market. Taking your budget constraints into consideration, I can offer a price of $14750. This represents significant value for the quality you're receiving, and it's a substantial reduction from my initial assessment of the product's worth. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price point.",14750.0,Alice,5,
