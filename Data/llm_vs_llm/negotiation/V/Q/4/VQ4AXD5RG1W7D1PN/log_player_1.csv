Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, your asking price of $18500 is quite high for my budget. I've done some market research, and I believe a fair price would be $12000. This takes into account current market conditions and similar products available. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges your budget concerns while reflecting the product's genuine value."", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16000 is still above my budget. I've found similar products in the market for lower prices. I can increase my offer to $13500, which I believe is a fair price that better reflects the current market conditions. Would this work for you?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your continued interest in the product. While you mention similar products at lower prices, I want to emphasize that this particular item has superior features and durability compared to alternatives on the market. Taking your budget constraints into consideration, I can offer a price of $14,750. This represents significant value for the quality you're receiving, and it's a substantial reduction from my initial assessment of the product's worth. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price point."", ""product_price"": 14750}"
