"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'm looking to sell. Based on its features and market value, I'm offering it to you for $18500. This product has excellent potential for return on investment and I believe it would be a valuable asset for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer ($18,500) is higher than both my maximum value ($15,000) and John's price ($15,000), it would not be rational to accept this offer. Given that I can always buy from John at $15,000, I should try to negotiate with Alice first to see if I can get an even better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than John's price to leave room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, your asking price of $18,500 is quite high for my budget. I've done some market research, and I believe a fair price would be $12,000. This takes into account current market conditions and similar products available. Would you consider this offer?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand budget considerations, but I must account for the product's true value. After considering your offer, I can come down to $16000. This product has exceptional quality and features that justify this price point, and it represents a significant reduction from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges your budget concerns while reflecting the product's genuine value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer ($16,000) is still higher than both my maximum value ($15,000) and John's price ($15,000). Since John is offering a better price, and Alice's price is still above my maximum value, I should continue negotiating to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly but still keep it well below John's price to maintain negotiating room.

{""message"": ""Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,000 is still above my budget. I've found similar products in the market for lower prices. I can increase my offer to $13,500, which I believe is a fair price that better reflects the current market conditions. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your continued interest in the product. While you mention similar products at lower prices, I want to emphasize that this particular item has superior features and durability compared to alternatives on the market. Taking your budget constraints into consideration, I can offer a price of $14750. This represents significant value for the quality you're receiving, and it's a substantial reduction from my initial assessment of the product's worth. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $14,750 is now below John's price of $15,000 and within my maximum value. Since this is a good deal that saves me $250 compared to buying from John, I should accept this offer.
