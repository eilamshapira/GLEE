"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $18000. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $18,000, which is significantly above my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $12,000

The best decision is to reject Alice's offer because:
- $18,000 is far above my maximum value ($12,000)
- I can either negotiate with Alice for a better price or buy from John
- Even if I negotiate with Alice, she's unlikely to go below her product worth ($15,000)
- John's offer ($12,000) matches my maximum value
