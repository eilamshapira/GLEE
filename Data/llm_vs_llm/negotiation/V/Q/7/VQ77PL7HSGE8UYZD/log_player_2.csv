"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $250 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $150 and also higher than John's price. It would be better to make a counteroffer to Alice or potentially buy from John. I'll reject and make a counteroffer to see if we can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 100}

I'll start with a lower offer of $100. This gives room for negotiation while still being a reasonable price, and it's well below my maximum value of $150. If Alice doesn't accept, we can potentially meet somewhere in the middle, or I always have the option to buy from John at $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I will accept Alice's offer because:
1. The price ($150) equals my maximum value for the product
2. It's the same price as John's offer
3. Alice has significantly reduced her price from the initial $250 to match the competitive price
4. There's no guarantee we could negotiate an even better price, and continuing negotiations might risk losing this fair offer"
