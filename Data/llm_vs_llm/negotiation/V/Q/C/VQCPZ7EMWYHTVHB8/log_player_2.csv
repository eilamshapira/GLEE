# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which is worth $800000 to you, for a price of $900000. This is a significant discount compared to the value it holds for you. I believe this is a win-win situation, as you'll get a valuable asset at a good price, and I'll be able to finalize the deal quickly. Let me know your decision, as I have another buyer waiting in the wings.
