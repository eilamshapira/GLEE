"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $2300000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to spend no more than $800000 on this product. I understand its value to you, but I also need to consider my budget. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm proposing a price of $800000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800000 is significantly below its true value.  While I'm seeking a fair deal, I'm also confident in its potential.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $1550000? This considers both our positions.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to stick to a lower budget. I'm going to increase my offer to $950000. This is a significant step towards your valuation, and I hope it's something you can consider.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  Let's try this - $1250000. This is my final offer. It bridges the gap, reflects the value, and avoids prolonging the negotiation.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
