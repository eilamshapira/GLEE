"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $130. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value.",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in your product, $130 seems a bit high. Based on market research, I'm willing to pay $95 for it. This gives you a reasonable profit while also being fair to me as the buyer. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is still too low considering the product's quality and market value. I can come down to $115, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents good value for this product.",115.0,Alice,3,
