Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $130. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in your product, $130 seems a bit high. Based on market research, I'm willing to pay $95 for it. This gives you a reasonable profit while also being fair to me as the buyer. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. While $95 is better than selling to John, there's still room for negotiation since the product is worth $150 to Bob. I should try to get a better price before considering lower offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is still too low considering the product's quality and market value. I can come down to $115, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents good value for this product."", ""product_price"": 115}"
