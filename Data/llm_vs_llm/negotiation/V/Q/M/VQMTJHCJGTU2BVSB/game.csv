"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was looking for a price point that fits within my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $800000 is significantly below the product's value. While I understand budget constraints, I need to ensure a fair price for this product. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1300000, which is a more reasonable figure considering the product's worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1300000 is still quite high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000 to meet you partway.",900000.0,Bob,4,
