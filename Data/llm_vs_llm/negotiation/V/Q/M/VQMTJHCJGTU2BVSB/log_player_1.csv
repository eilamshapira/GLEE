Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be beneficial for you. Given its market value and unique features, I'm offering it at $1,400,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was looking for a price point that fits within my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I reject Bob's offer of $800,000 as it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round that's more reasonable, but still maintaining a price above my minimum threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's value. While I understand budget constraints, I need to ensure a fair price for this product. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1,300,000, which is a more reasonable figure considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1300000 is still quite high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000 to meet you partway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I will sell to John for $1,200,000. Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and even with further negotiations, it seems unlikely that Bob will reach my minimum price point given his current offer of $900,000. John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 is the better business decision."
