"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am offering you my exclusive product for $1200000. Please note that I have received a firm commitment from another buyer at $800000 should you decide not to proceed. This is an exceptional opportunity, so if the product aligns with your interests, I encourage you to take advantage of this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $1,200,000, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer. Additionally, I have the option to buy the product from John for $800,000, which aligns with my budget.
