"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Given the information:
- The product is worth up to $12,000 to you
- Alice's offer is $11,000
- John will sell it for $12,000

Alice's offer is already $1,000 less than your maximum value and John's price. However, since Alice's cost is only $8,000, there might be room to negotiate an even better price.

I'll reject this offer to make a counteroffer, as this gives me a chance to save more money while still having the fallback option of John's offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll send a counteroffer to Alice that gives her a reasonable profit while still saving me more money.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her price from $11,000 to $10,500, which is a step in the right direction. This price is now $1,500 less than my maximum value and John's price. Since Alice's cost is $8,000, she still has a $2,500 profit margin at this price, which means there might still be room for negotiation.

I'll reject this offer to make another counteroffer, as I could potentially save even more money while still having John as a backup option.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer to show I'm negotiating in good faith while still trying to get a better price than Alice's last offer.

{""product_price"": $9,800}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice continues to reduce her price and is now offering the product at $10,200, which is $1,800 less than my maximum value and John's price. She's moved down from her initial offer of $11,000, showing she's willing to negotiate.

At this point, Alice would still make a $2,200 profit (based on her $8,000 cost), and I would save $1,800 compared to buying from John. While I could try another round of negotiation, the price is already getting quite favorable, and there's a risk Alice might not reduce it further or might become frustrated with continued haggling.

I'll accept this offer as it represents a good savings from my maximum price.
