"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Here's how I'll make my decision:

*   **Value to me:** The product is worth $120 to me.
*   **Alice's offer:** $100
*   **Buying from John:** $120

Since the offer from Alice ($100) is less than what the product is worth to me ($120), and is also less than the price from John ($120), I should accept Alice's offer.
