"Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $800,000
2. John's price is $800,000
3. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
4. Both offers are at my maximum value threshold

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($800,000), and this is exactly my maximum value threshold, I am indifferent between the two sellers. I might as well accept Alice's offer since we're already in negotiation.
