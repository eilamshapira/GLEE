Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is higher than the minimum amount I'm willing to accept ($1,000,000) but lower than the amount I initially offered ($1,200,000), I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

My counteroffer will be $1,150,000, which is still lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's offer, in an attempt to meet him halfway and maximize my earnings.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my new offer is: $1,150,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000}"
