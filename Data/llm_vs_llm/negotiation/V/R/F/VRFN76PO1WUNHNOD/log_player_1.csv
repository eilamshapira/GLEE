Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $15,000 to Bob
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $15,000
3. Since Bob values it at $15,000, he won't pay more than that
4. If Bob rejects, I'm not worse off as I can still sell to John
5. Best strategy is to offer at Bob's maximum value
