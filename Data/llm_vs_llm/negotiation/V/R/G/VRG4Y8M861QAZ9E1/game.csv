"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell at $1400000, which is already better than my alternative option. However, I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. I understand the product is valuable, but I'm looking for a more competitive price. I'm prepared to offer $1150000 for the product, which would give you a solid profit while allowing me to stay well within my budget. What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,2,

However, I must consider the product's value and my own requirements. I'm willing to make a concession, but I still believe the product is worth more than your offer.
