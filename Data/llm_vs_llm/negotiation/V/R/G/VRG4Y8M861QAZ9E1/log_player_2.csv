"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will bring significant value to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $1,500,000 to me (maximum value)
2. The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice (her cost)
3. Alice is offering to sell it to me for $1,400,000
4. I can buy from John for $1,500,000 at any time

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is $100,000 less than John's price, which is good. However, there's still significant room for negotiation since Alice's cost is only $1,000,000. I should reject this initial offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell at $1,400,000, which is already better than my alternative option. However, I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. I understand the product is valuable, but I'm looking for a more competitive price. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000 for the product, which would give you a solid profit while allowing me to stay well within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $1150000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. However, I must consider the product's value and my own requirements. I'm willing to make a concession, but I still believe the product is worth more than your offer. I'm prepared to sell the product to you for $1320000, which is a compromise between our initial positions. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll analyze the updated situation:

Alice has come down from $1,400,000 to $1,320,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is now $180,000 below John's price of $1,500,000, which is good progress. However, there's still room to negotiate since Alice's cost is $1,000,000.

We've made some progress, but I should continue negotiating to try to get a better price. Alice has moved $80,000 from her initial offer, while I started at $1,150,000. Let's continue the negotiation.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for reducing your price to $1,320,000. I can see you're willing to work with me, which I appreciate. I'm also willing to move from my initial position. Looking at the value proposition, I can increase my offer to $1,225,000, which represents a significant profit for you while still giving me the savings I need compared to my alternative option. This seems like a fair middle ground that benefits us both. What are your thoughts on this offer?"", ""product_price"": 1225000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $1225000. I appreciate the effort you're putting into finding a mutually beneficial price. However, I still believe the product's value warrants a higher price. Considering your willingness to increase your offer, I'm prepared to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1280000, which is closer to your latest offer while still reflecting the product's worth. I hope this revised offer brings us closer to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze the current negotiation status:

1. Alice started at $1,400,000
2. I countered at $1,150,000
3. Alice came down to $1,320,000
4. I countered at $1,225,000
5. Alice has now offered $1,280,000

Alice has come down $120,000 from her initial offer (from $1,400,000 to $1,280,000), which is good progress. This price is now $220,000 below John's price of $1,500,000. 

We're getting closer, but I think there's still room to negotiate. Alice's cost is $1,000,000, so at $1,280,000, she would make a $280,000 profit. I'll reject and make one more counteroffer.
