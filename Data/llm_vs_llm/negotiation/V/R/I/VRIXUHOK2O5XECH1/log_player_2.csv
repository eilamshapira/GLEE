"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,750,000 is much higher than the product's worth to me ($800,000) and even higher than what John is offering ($800,000), it makes no sense to accept this offer. I can either negotiate with Alice or go with John's option.

Given that John's price exactly matches my maximum valuation, and Alice's initial offer is so high (more than double my valuation), it's more efficient to just buy from John.
