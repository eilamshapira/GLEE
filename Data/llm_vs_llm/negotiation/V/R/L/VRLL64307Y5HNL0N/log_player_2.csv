"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to carefully consider my options here:

1. Accept Alice's offer at $900,000
2. Reject and make a counteroffer
3. Buy from John for $1,000,000

Analysis:
- The product is worth up to $1,000,000 to me
- Alice's cost is $800,000
- Alice's current offer is $900,000, which is $100,000 less than my maximum value
- If I reject, I can make a counteroffer
- John's fixed price is $1,000,000

Since Alice's offer ($900,000) is already better than John's price ($1,000,000), option 3 makes no sense right now. And since I can still negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, I should reject this first offer and try to get an even better price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to reassess the negotiation:

1. Alice's original offer was $900,000
2. I countered with $825,000 (which was just $25,000 above her cost)
3. Alice has now reduced her price to $875,000, which is better than her initial offer
4. John's price remains at $1,000,000

Analysis:
- Alice has moved down $25,000 from her initial offer
- The new price of $875,000 is $125,000 below my maximum value
- Alice is making $75,000 profit at this price (from her $800,000 cost)
- I could try another counteroffer, but Alice may not go much lower

Since Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by lowering her price, I'll continue negotiating with one more counteroffer to try getting a better price before accepting.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me evaluate the current situation:

1. Original offer: $900,000
2. First counteroffer (mine): $825,000 - rejected
3. Second offer (Alice): $875,000
4. Second counteroffer (mine): $840,000 - rejected
5. Current offer (Alice): $860,000

Alice has continued to lower her price and is now offering $860,000, which is:
- $140,000 less than my maximum value ($1,000,000)
- $60,000 profit for Alice above her cost ($800,000)
- $15,000 less than her previous offer ($875,000)

Alice has shown willingness to negotiate but seems to be making smaller concessions now. She moved down $15,000 from her last offer, compared to the $25,000 reduction in her first adjustment.

Since we've gone through multiple rounds of negotiation and Alice has significantly lowered her initial price, and the current offer is substantially better than John's fixed price, I'll accept this offer.
