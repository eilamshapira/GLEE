"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $200 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to buy the product for $75. Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $75 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I see your point, but $130 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $90? I think that's a reasonable compromise.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, I can't go as low as $90.  My final offer is $115.  I think this is a fair compromise, and a great deal for you.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $115 is still above what I'm willing to spend. I can go up to $95. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",95.0,Bob,6,
