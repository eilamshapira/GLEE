Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $200 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to buy the product for $75. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $75 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I see your point, but $130 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $90? I think that's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, I can't go as low as $90.  My final offer is $115.  I think this is a fair compromise, and a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $115 is still above what I'm willing to spend. I can go up to $95. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While getting Bob closer to $100 would be ideal, his increases are getting smaller. It's unlikely he'll come up much higher and I'm better off taking the guaranteed $150 from John."
