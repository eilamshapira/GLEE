"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your perspective, $7000 is lower than I can accept. Considering the unique qualities and long-term value of this product, I'd be willing to come down to $12000.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $12000, but it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $9500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering I have another option to buy the product from John for $8000.",9500.0,Bob,4,
