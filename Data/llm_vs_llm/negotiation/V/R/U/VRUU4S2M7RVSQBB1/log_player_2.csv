"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $12,000 compared to my best alternative.

Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $8,000, Alice's offer of $12,000 is clearly not a good deal. It exceeds both my maximum valuation and my alternative option.

The rational decision is to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations fail, I can always fall back on John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives us room to negotiate while being significantly better than my alternative option of buying from John at $8,000.

{""product_price"": $5,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has only dropped her price from $12,000 to $11,000, which is still above the $8,000 that I could pay John for the same product. Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, paying $11,000 would result in a loss of at least $3,000.

The rational choice is to reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating. If we can't reach an agreement at or below $8,000, I always have the option to buy from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly to show good faith in the negotiation while still keeping it well below John's price of $8,000.

{""product_price"": $6,200}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's offer has come down to $10,000, which shows we're making progress in the negotiation. However, this is still $2,000 above what I can pay John for the same product ($8,000). Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, accepting Alice's offer would result in paying more than the product's value.

The rational choice is to continue rejecting Alice's offers until we reach a price at or below $8,000, or to eventually buy from John if Alice won't come down to a competitive price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer again to continue showing negotiation progress while staying below my maximum acceptable price.

{""product_price"": $6,800}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's offer has come down to $9,000, which is getting closer but still exceeds my alternative option of buying from John for $8,000. Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, accepting Alice's offer of $9,000 would mean paying $1,000 more than the product's maximum value to me.

Given that we have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $8,000, and Alice's offer is still above that price, the rational decision is to reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer that's getting closer to my maximum price while still leaving room for one final negotiation if needed.
