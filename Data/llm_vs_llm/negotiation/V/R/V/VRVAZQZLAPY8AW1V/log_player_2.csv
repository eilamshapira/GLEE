"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $20000. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm open to negotiations if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still shows that I'm interested in the product. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a relatively low offer.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $18000, considering its value and uniqueness. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe this price is more reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $18,000 is still above my target price, but it's lower than her initial offer. I'll reject this offer as well and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has already come down from $20,000 to $18,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between my previous offer of $10,000 and her current offer of $18,000. I'll propose a counteroffer of $14,000, which is still below my maximum budget of $15,000.

{""message"": ""Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you believe the product is worth $18,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $14,000, which I think is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above your proposed price. I'd like to counter with $16500, which I believe is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $16,500 is still above my target price, and I have the option to buy the product from John for $15,000, which is lower than Alice's current offer. Since I'm trying to save as much money as possible, I think it's time to consider buying from John instead of continuing to negotiate with Alice.
