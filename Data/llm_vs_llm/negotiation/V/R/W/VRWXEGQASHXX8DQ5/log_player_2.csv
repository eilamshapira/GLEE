"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $150
2. Alice's offer is $120, which is below my maximum value
3. John's fixed price is $150
4. I still have 9 more rounds of negotiation possible
5. Alice's initial offer of $120 might be negotiable down further

While $120 is a reasonable price (it saves me $30 compared to John's offer), since this is just the first round and Alice's opening offer, there might be room to negotiate for an even better price. The risk of negotiating further is low because I can always fall back to John's offer if needed.

Therefore, I'll reject this offer to try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice offered $120, I'll try to negotiate for a significantly lower price while still being reasonable. I'll offer $90, which is $30 less than her initial offer. This gives room for negotiation while not being so low as to be offensive.

{""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The negotiation history:
   - Alice first offered: $120
   - I countered with: $90
   - Alice now offers: $110

2. This shows Alice is willing to negotiate and has already reduced her price by $10. The new offer of $110 is:
   - $40 less than John's price ($150)
   - A reasonable movement from her initial offer
   - Still might have room for a bit more negotiation

3. We still have 7 more rounds possible, but there's also a risk that Alice might increase her price if I push too hard.

Given that $110 is already a good price (saves me $40 compared to John's price) and Alice has shown reasonable movement in the negotiation, I'll accept this offer. The potential benefit of trying to negotiate further might not be worth the risk of losing this good deal.
