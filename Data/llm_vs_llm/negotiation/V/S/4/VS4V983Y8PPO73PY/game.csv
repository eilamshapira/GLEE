"Bob, I have a truly unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable to the right buyer.  I'm offering it to you first at a price of $1500000.  This is a significant discount, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice, thanks for presenting your offer. While I recognize the productâ€™s value, I'm prepared to purchase at a price that better aligns with my current market view. How about $500000 for the product? I believe this is a fair starting point and am open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",500000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $500000 is simply too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to work with you.  Let me know if you're interested in this price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. However, $1000000 is still above what I'm ready to invest for this product. Would you consider $750000 as a fair compromise?",,Bob,3,RejectOffer,750000.0
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I recognize that my previous offer may have undervalued the product, so I'm willing to revise my offer upwards. Keeping in mind my budget constraints and alternative options on the market, would you consider closing the deal at $800000? This is a firm offer, and I'm prepared to move forward quickly if we can agree on this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the revised offer. However,  $800000 still falls short of the value I've placed on this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $900000. This is a final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that recognizes both our needs.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,5,,
