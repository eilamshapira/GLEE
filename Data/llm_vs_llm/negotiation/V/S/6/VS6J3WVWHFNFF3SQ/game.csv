"Hi Bob, I'd like to offer you a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $1800000. This product has exceptional value and potential for significant returns. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on this price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $1000000 is below the minimum value I can accept. This product has exceptional quality and value in the market. I can come down to $1550000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. Would this work for you?",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1550000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000.  Let's split the difference and see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
