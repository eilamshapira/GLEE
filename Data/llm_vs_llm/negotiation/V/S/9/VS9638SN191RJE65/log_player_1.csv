"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm starting with a competitive price."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you, Alice. I appreciate the offer but $1500000 is above my budget. I'm willing to discuss this further. How about we settle at $1000000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and I have the option to sell it to John for $1,200,000, I will choose to sell the product to John to ensure I get the minimum value I'm looking for.
