"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe you'll be very interested in. Considering its exclusivity and potential, I'm willing to offer it to you for a price of: 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to consider this offer carefully.

Alice is offering the product for $2,500,000, which is significantly higher than the maximum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me. Additionally, I have the option to buy the same product from John for $1,000,000.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and the product is only worth up to $1,000,000 to me, I should not pay more than that amount.
