"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to acquire this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $2000000. I believe this price reflects its true value and potential return on investment.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, I'm looking at a significantly lower price point based on my budget and assessment. I can offer $850000 for the product. This is considerably lower than your asking price, but I'm hoping we can find some middle ground. Keep in mind I do have another option with John at $1200000, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $850000 is significantly below its value.  While I'm open to negotiation, I need to see a price that reflects the potential of this product. Would you be willing to consider $1700000? This feels like a fairer compromise that still allows for a significant return on your investment.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1700000 is still substantially above what makes financial sense for me. I need to be transparent that my maximum budget for this product is $1200000, which happens to be exactly what John is offering. I'd prefer to do business with you, so I'm willing to offer you $1000000. This gives you a better deal than simply matching John's price, while still being within a range I can justify.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget and your willingness to find a compromise. While $1000000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I recognize the value of closing this deal with you. Let's settle this at $1350000. This price acknowledges your budget constraints while still reflecting the true worth of what I'm offering.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. Your offer of $1350000 shows we're moving in the right direction, but I still need to emphasize that $1200000 is truly my ceiling on this purchase - that's both my maximum valuation and exactly what John is offering. To provide some incentive to close with you rather than John, I can offer $1150000. This gives you a slight premium over my alternative while keeping within my budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price point.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down slightly further to meet you halfway.  Would you consider $1250000?  This is a significant compromise on my end, and it's the final offer I'm prepared to make.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
