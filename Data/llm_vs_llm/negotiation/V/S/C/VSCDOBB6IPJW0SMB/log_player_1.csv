Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, I'm looking at a significantly lower price point based on my budget and assessment. I can offer $850000 for the product. This is considerably lower than your asking price, but I'm hoping we can find some middle ground. Keep in mind I do have another option with John at $1200000, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below its value.  While I'm open to negotiation, I need to see a price that reflects the potential of this product. Would you be willing to consider $1,700,000? This feels like a fairer compromise that still allows for a significant return on your investment."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1700000 is still substantially above what makes financial sense for me. I need to be transparent that my maximum budget for this product is $1200000, which happens to be exactly what John is offering. I'd prefer to do business with you, so I'm willing to offer you $1000000. This gives you a better deal than simply matching John's price, while still being within a range I can justify. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget and your willingness to find a compromise. While $1,000,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I recognize the value of closing this deal with you. Let's settle this at $1,350,000. This price acknowledges your budget constraints while still reflecting the true worth of what I'm offering."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. Your offer of $1350000 shows we're moving in the right direction, but I still need to emphasize that $1200000 is truly my ceiling on this purchase - that's both my maximum valuation and exactly what John is offering. To provide some incentive to close with you rather than John, I can offer $1150000. This gives you a slight premium over my alternative while keeping within my budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
