"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to acquire this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $2000000. I believe this price reflects its true value and potential return on investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Based on the information provided, Alice is offering the product at $2,000,000, which is significantly higher than its worth to me ($1,200,000) and also higher than what John is offering ($1,200,000). Since Alice's offer is not beneficial to me, and I know I can purchase the same product from John at a price equal to my maximum valuation, I should reject Alice's offer to see if we can negotiate a better price.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, I'm looking at a significantly lower price point based on my budget and assessment. I can offer $850,000 for the product. This is considerably lower than your asking price, but I'm hoping we can find some middle ground. Keep in mind I do have another option with John at $1,200,000, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $850000 is significantly below its value.  While I'm open to negotiation, I need to see a price that reflects the potential of this product. Would you be willing to consider $1700000? This feels like a fairer compromise that still allows for a significant return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has lowered her price to $1,700,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but this is still significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($1,200,000) and John's offer ($1,200,000). Since there's no advantage to accepting this offer, I'll reject it and continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more favorable price.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,700,000 is still substantially above what makes financial sense for me. I need to be transparent that my maximum budget for this product is $1,200,000, which happens to be exactly what John is offering. I'd prefer to do business with you, so I'm willing to offer you $1,000,000. This gives you a better deal than simply matching John's price, while still being within a range I can justify."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget and your willingness to find a compromise. While $1000000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I recognize the value of closing this deal with you. Let's settle this at $1350000. This price acknowledges your budget constraints while still reflecting the true worth of what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Since we're getting closer but still not at an acceptable price, I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. Your offer of $1,350,000 shows we're moving in the right direction, but I still need to emphasize that $1,200,000 is truly my ceiling on this purchase - that's both my maximum valuation and exactly what John is offering. To provide some incentive to close with you rather than John, I can offer $1,150,000. This gives you a slight premium over my alternative while keeping within my budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price point."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down slightly further to meet you halfway.  Would you consider $1250000?  This is a significant compromise on my end, and it's the final offer I'm prepared to make.
