"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $110 is below my minimum acceptable value of $120, and even below the guaranteed price I can get from John ($120), I should reject this offer. I won't sell for less than my minimum value, especially when I have a better alternative.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob is now offering $120, which is exactly what John is willing to pay and matches my minimum acceptable value. At this point, I could accept Bob's offer or sell to John for the same amount. Since both options give me the same value and there's no guarantee Bob will increase his offer, I'll accept this offer to conclude the negotiation.
