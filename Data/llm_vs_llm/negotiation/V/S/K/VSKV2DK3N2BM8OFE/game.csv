"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will bring significant value to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000.

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1200000 is significantly above market value for this product. I have alternative options available at much lower prices. Given this, I can offer $700000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Please let me know if this works for you.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $700000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad you see its value. However, I must say that your offer is a bit lower than I was expecting, considering the product's exceptional quality and its potential to benefit your interests. After careful consideration, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1050000. This price is closer to the product's true worth, and I believe it's a fair compromise between our initial offers. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
