Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will bring significant value to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's exceptional quality and its potential to benefit your interests. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident that this price is fair considering the product's worth. Let me know if you're interested in accepting this offer or if you'd like to discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1200000 is significantly above market value for this product. I have alternative options available at much lower prices. Given this, I can offer $700000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $700,000 is below the product's worth to him ($800,000) and significantly lower than the product's worth to me ($1,000,000), I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad you see its value. However, I must say that your offer is a bit lower than I was expecting, considering the product's exceptional quality and its potential to benefit your interests. After careful consideration, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This price is closer to the product's true worth, and I believe it's a fair compromise between our initial offers. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
