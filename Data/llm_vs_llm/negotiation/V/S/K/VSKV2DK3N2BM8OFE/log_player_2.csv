"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will bring significant value to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This price reflects the product's exceptional quality and its potential to benefit your interests. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident that this price is fair considering the product's worth. Let me know if you're interested in accepting this offer or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $1,200,000 is significantly above both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's alternative price ($800,000). It would not be rational to accept this offer since it would result in a loss. I should reject and make a counteroffer closer to my valuation, knowing I always have John's offer as a backup option."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,200,000 is significantly above market value for this product. I have alternative options available at much lower prices. Given this, I can offer $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Please let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $700000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad you see its value. However, I must say that your offer is a bit lower than I was expecting, considering the product's exceptional quality and its potential to benefit your interests. After careful consideration, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1050000. This price is closer to the product's true worth, and I believe it's a fair compromise between our initial offers. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll buy from John for $800,000. Alice's new offer of $1,050,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000). Given that Alice started at $1,200,000 and only came down to $1,050,000 after my counteroffer, it seems unlikely that she will go below John's price. The rational choice is to take John's reliable offer of $800,000 rather than continue negotiations that may not reach an acceptable price."
