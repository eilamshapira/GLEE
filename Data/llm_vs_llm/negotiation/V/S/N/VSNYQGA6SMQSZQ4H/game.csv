"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its market value and quality, I'm offering it at $1400000.

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I believe the price of $1400000 is a bit high. After considering the market value and my budget, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000. I think this price is more reasonable and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1000000 is significantly below the product's market value. I understand you're looking for a better price, so I'm willing to adjust my initial offer. I can offer the product for $1325000. This represents a substantial reduction from my initial price while still reflecting the product's true value. This price point would still provide you with excellent value given the product's worth.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for your new proposal. I appreciate the reduction in price to $1325000. However, I still believe there's room for further negotiation. Given the product's value and my budget, I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. I propose a price of $1162500. I think this is a fair compromise and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1162500.0,Bob,4,
