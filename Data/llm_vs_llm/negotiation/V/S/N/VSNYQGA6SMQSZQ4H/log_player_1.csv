Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I believe the price of $1400000 is a bit high. After considering the market value and my budget, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000. I think this price is more reasonable and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer because:
1. Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000
2. I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, so there's room for negotiation
3. While I have John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 as a backup, I can try to negotiate with Bob for a better price before considering that option"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below the product's market value. I understand you're looking for a better price, so I'm willing to adjust my initial offer. I can offer the product for $1,325,000. This represents a substantial reduction from my initial price while still reflecting the product's true value. This price point would still provide you with excellent value given the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1325000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for your new proposal. I appreciate the reduction in price to $1325000. However, I still believe there's room for further negotiation. Given the product's value and my budget, I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. I propose a price of $1162500. I think this is a fair compromise and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

I choose to sell to John because:
1. Bob's offer of $1,162,500 is still below John's guaranteed $1,200,000
2. Based on Bob's negotiation pattern, he's making relatively small increases in his offers
3. There's a risk that continuing negotiations could lead to wasted time without reaching a price above John's offer
4. The certain $1,200,000 from John is above my minimum price and provides a guaranteed profitable outcome"
