Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1000000 is significantly below the product's market value. I understand you're looking for a better price, so I'm willing to adjust my initial offer. I can offer the product for $1325000. This represents a substantial reduction from my initial price while still reflecting the product's true value. This price point would still provide you with excellent value given the product's worth.
