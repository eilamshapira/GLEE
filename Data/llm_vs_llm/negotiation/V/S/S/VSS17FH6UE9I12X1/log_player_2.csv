"Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and Jhon is willing to sell it for exactly $8,000, Alice's offer of $25,000 is much too high. There's no reason for me to accept this offer or even to negotiate with Alice when I have a guaranteed option to purchase at my maximum valuation.
