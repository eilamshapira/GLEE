"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's make a counteroffer to Alice. Since the product is worth $800,000 to me and Alice values it at $1,500,000, there's room for negotiation. I'll start with a lower offer to see how Alice responds.

Counteroffer: $600,000"
