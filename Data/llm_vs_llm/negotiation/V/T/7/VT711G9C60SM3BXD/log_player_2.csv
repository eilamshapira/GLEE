"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this exclusive product for $150. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'll analyze the situation:
1. Alice's offer is $150, which is above my maximum value ($120)
2. John's fixed price is $120, which is my maximum acceptable price
3. I can try to negotiate with Alice for a better price

Since Alice's initial offer ($150) is significantly higher than my maximum value ($120), and even higher than John's price ($120), I should reject it and make a counteroffer. There's no risk in negotiating since I always have John's offer as a backup.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's below my maximum value but leaves room for negotiation:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $150 is too high for me. Given market prices and my budget, I can offer $90 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}

I chose $90 because:
1. It's well below my maximum value ($120)
2. It gives room for negotiation upward
3. If Alice counters with a higher price, I can still gradually increase my offer while staying under my $120 limit
4. If negotiations fail, I still have John's offer at $120 as a backup"
