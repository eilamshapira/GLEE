Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $8,000 to both me and Bob
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $8,000
3. Since Bob values it at $8,000, he won't pay more than that
4. If Bob rejects, I'm not worse off as I can sell to John
5. The rational choice is to offer it to Bob at $8,000
