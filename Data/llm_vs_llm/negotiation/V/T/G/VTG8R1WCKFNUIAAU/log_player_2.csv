"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer of $200 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $120 and John's guaranteed price of $120, it would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. John's price matches my maximum value and is a better deal than Alice's offer.
