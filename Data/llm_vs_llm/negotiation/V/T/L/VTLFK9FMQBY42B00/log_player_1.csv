Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start with a price significantly higher than our minimum ($12,000). This allows room for negotiation and potentially lets us gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing specifics, aiming to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Direct Approach:**  The offer is clear and direct, making it easy for Bob to understand and respond. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** We don't know Bob's budget or how much he values the product. This offer is a starting point for negotiation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Offering a high price risks Bob rejecting it outright. However, if he accepts, the reward is significant.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup buyer gives us a safety net and allows us to be more confident in our negotiations with Bob."
