Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

I reject Bob's offer of $50 because it's significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product, which is $150. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to find a mutually agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be out of your budget, but $50 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Let's try to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 175}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $175 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.

You have three options:

I reject Bob's offer of $75 because it's still far below the minimum value I have for the product, which is $150. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to see a more significant increase in Bob's offer to consider it seriously. I'll make another counteroffer to try to bridge the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet halfway, but $75 is still too low for me.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand that $75 was too low, and I appreciate your willingness to make a concession. However, $160 is still a bit out of my budget.

I reject Bob's offer of $90 because it's still significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product, which is $150. Although Bob is increasing his offer, the pace of the increase is slow, and we're running out of rounds. I'll make another counteroffer, but I'm getting closer to considering the option to sell to John for $150."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $100 because it's still below the minimum value I have for the product, which is $150, and also below the price I can get from John. With only two rounds left, I don't think Bob will increase his offer enough to meet my target price. However, I'll give him one last chance to make a significant increase before I consider selling to John."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your more substantial increase, but $100 is still short of my target price. We're down to the last two rounds, and I need to see a significant jump from you to consider selling to you.
