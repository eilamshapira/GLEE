"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to analyze Alice's offer carefully.

Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which is $3,000 more than what it's worth to me (and $3,000 more than John's price).

Since my goal is to save as much money as possible while still getting the product, and I have the option to buy from John for $12,000 at any time, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at $15,000.

I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations don't work out, I can always fall back on John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice that gives me room to negotiate while still potentially saving money compared to John's price.

{""product_price"": $10,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has lowered her price to $13,500, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this price is still $1,500 more than John's offer of $12,000.

Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, and John's offer is still better than Alice's current offer, I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer. If Alice can't beat (or at least match) John's price, I'll eventually go with John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still aim to get a price better than John's offer.

{""product_price"": $11,000}"
