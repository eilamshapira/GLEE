"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $80. Let me know if youâ€™d like to buy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth $80 to me (my maximum value)
2. Alice is offering it for $80
3. John is selling it for $80

Since all prices are the same ($80), and this equals my maximum value, I am indifferent between buying from Alice or John. However, since Alice has already made the offer and we're in communication, it's more straightforward to accept her offer rather than start a new transaction with John.
