"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $950000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850000.  This is a fair price, considering your value of $800000 and my maximum budget.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850000.  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's try to come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
