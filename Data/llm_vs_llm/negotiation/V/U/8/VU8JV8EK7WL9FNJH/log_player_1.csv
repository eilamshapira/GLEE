Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $950000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850000.  This is a fair price, considering your value of $800000 and my maximum budget.  Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Considering Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price, I need to decide.

Since I'm aiming to maximize my earnings and $850,000 is more than what John is offering, I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay Bob, I understand your position. However, considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at **$900,000**?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850000.  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's try to come to an agreement.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","I'm in a bit of a bind here. Bob is sticking firm at $850,000. My minimum is $800,000. I could try to push for a higher price, but I risk losing the sale entirely. John's offer is still on the table.

Given Bob's unwillingness to budge, I will accept his offer and make a profit over selling it to John.
