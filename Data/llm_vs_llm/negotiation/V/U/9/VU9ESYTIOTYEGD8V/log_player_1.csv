Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make a strategic offer to Bob, considering that the product is worth $10,000 to him and I have a guaranteed fallback of selling it to John for $10,000.

Since Bob and I both value the product at $10,000, there's no room for mutual gain from trade. If I offer Bob any price above $10,000, he would logically reject it since he wouldn't pay more than what the product is worth to him. If I offer exactly $10,000, he might be indifferent between accepting and rejecting.

Since I have a guaranteed sale to John at $10,000, I'll offer Bob the same price.
