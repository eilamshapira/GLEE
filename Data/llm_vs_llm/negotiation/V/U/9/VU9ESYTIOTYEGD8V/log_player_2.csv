"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Looking at the situation:

- Alice is offering the product for $10,000
- The product is worth up to $10,000 to you
- If you reject Alice's offer, you can buy from John for $10,000

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($10,000), and this price equals the maximum value of the product to you, there's no financial advantage to choosing one over the other. The outcome is the same either way.
