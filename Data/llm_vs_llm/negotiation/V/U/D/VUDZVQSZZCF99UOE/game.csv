"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $300 is too high for me. The product is only worth $120 to me, which is what another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer you $90 for the product. This would save me some money compared to my other option while giving you a sale. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
