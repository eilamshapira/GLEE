Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product at $300. Let me know if this works for you!"", ""product_price"": 300}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $300 is too high for me. The product is only worth $120 to me, which is what another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer you $90 for the product. This would save me some money compared to my other option while giving you a sale. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
