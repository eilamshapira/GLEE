"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product at $300. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to evaluate this offer. Alice is offering the product at $300, but it's worth no more than $120 to me. Additionally, I have the option to buy from John at any time for $120.

Given that:
1) Alice's offer of $300 is well above my maximum value ($120)
2) I have the guaranteed option to buy from John for $120
3) There's no reason to pay more than the product is worth to me

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $300 is too high for me. The product is only worth $120 to me, which is what another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer you $90 for the product. This would save me some money compared to my other option while giving you a sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
