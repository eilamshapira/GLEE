"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer ($1,500,000) is higher than both my maximum valuation ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000), the best decision is to buy from John. Even if I try to negotiate with Alice, there's no guarantee she would go below $1,200,000, as that's her product's worth. John's price is already at my maximum acceptable price, so it's the safest and most economical choice."
