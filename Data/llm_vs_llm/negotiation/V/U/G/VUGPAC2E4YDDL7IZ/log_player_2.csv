"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $110.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth at most $80 to me (Bob).
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $110.
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $80.

Since Alice's price ($110) exceeds what the product is worth to me ($80), and John is offering exactly what the product is worth to me, it makes financial sense to buy from John.
