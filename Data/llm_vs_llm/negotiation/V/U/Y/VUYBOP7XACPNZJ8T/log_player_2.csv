Hello Alice,
Thank you for your offer. However, I find the price to be a bit high. I am looking to spend no more than $1,000,000. Would you be willing to negotiate the price down to a more reasonable figure that will be acceptable to both parties? I am willing to make a counteroffer of $800,000 to get the negotiation underway."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, I'm afraid $800000 is too low for me. I would be more comfortable selling the product for $1200000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product. If you're still interested, please let me know. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,200,000 is still higher than I'm willing to pay. I would like to meet in the middle and offer you $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price that works within my budget. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you."
