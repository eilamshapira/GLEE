"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer or not. 

Let me analyze the situation:
- The product is worth no more than $100 to me
- Alice is offering to sell the product for $90
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $100

Since Alice's offer ($90) is less than John's price ($100), and both are within my maximum value ($100), I should accept Alice's offer to save $10.
