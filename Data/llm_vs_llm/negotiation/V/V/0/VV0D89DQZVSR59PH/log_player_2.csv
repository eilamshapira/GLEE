"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at $1500000. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, and Alice's initial offer is $1,500,000, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of negotiating a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable, to see how she responds.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for this price?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
