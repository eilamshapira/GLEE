"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to evaluate Alice's offer and determine if it's a good deal compared to buying from John.

Alice is offering the product for $100, which is $20 less than John's price of $120. The product is worth no more than $120 to me, so Alice's offer is within my acceptable price range.

Since Alice's price is lower than John's, and I want to save as much money as possible while still getting the product, I should accept Alice's offer.
