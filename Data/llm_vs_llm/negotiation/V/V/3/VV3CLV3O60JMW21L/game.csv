Hello Bob! I have a wonderful product to offer you today. I'm willing to sell it for $120. This is a fair price considering the quality and value of the product. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?,120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you letting me know about the product.  While I think it's a great product, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to do $90?  That would be a great price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is a reasonable offer, I need to get a bit more for this item given its quality and value. Could we meet in the middle at $105? This would be a significant discount from my initial price and still represents good value for you.",105.0,Alice,3,
