Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a wonderful product to offer you today. I'm willing to sell it for $120. This is a fair price considering the quality and value of the product. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you letting me know about the product.  While I think it's a great product, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to do $90?  That would be a great price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe there's room for negotiation since my initial price of $120 and Bob's offer of $90 have quite a gap. I'll try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is a reasonable offer, I need to get a bit more for this item given its quality and value. Could we meet in the middle at $105? This would be a significant discount from my initial price and still represents good value for you."", ""product_price"": 105}"
