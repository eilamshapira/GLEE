"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000. This reflects my current valuation of the product and its potential benefits for my business.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While I understand budget constraints, $800000 is below what I can accept for this premium product. Given its quality and market value, I can offer it to you for $1000000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. This price reflects both the product's true value and my desire to work with you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I'm still a little hesitant at $1000000.  How about we meet in the middle at $900000? I feel this is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while staying within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
