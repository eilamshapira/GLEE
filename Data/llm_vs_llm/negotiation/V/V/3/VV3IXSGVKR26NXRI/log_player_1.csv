Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $1,200,000, which reflects its high quality and market value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000. This reflects my current valuation of the product and its potential benefits for my business.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Given that Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed offer of $800,000, but there might be potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer. Since Bob is still showing interest, there's a chance to secure a better price while keeping John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While I understand budget constraints, $800,000 is below what I can accept for this premium product. Given its quality and market value, I can offer it to you for $1,000,000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. This price reflects both the product's true value and my desire to work with you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I'm still a little hesitant at $1000000.  How about we meet in the middle at $900000? I feel this is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $900,000. This is a good outcome because:
1. It's $100,000 more than John's guaranteed offer of $800,000
2. Bob has moved up significantly from his initial offer
3. Further negotiation might risk losing the deal entirely
3. The price is reasonable and profitable for both parties"
