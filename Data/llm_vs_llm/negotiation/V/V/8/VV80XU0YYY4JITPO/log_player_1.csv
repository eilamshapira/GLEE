Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still maximizing potential profit.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm tempted by the immediate sale, $900,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to take the risk and see if I can push Bob higher with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to my initial offer. I hope this counteroffer shows my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a fair price."
