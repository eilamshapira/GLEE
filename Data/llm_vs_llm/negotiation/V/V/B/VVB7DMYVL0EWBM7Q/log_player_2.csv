"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer ($1,200,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000), it would not be rational to accept her offer. The best option is to buy from John at $800,000, which matches my maximum value and saves me $400,000 compared to Alice's offer.
