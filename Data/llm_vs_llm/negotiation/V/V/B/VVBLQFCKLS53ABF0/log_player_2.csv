"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this remarkable product. It's truly a unique asset with incredible potential. I'm willing to let it go for $1500000. This is a limited-time offer, Bob. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to consider Alice's offer of $1,500,000 against what I know:

1. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
2. John is willing to sell me the same product for $800,000

Alice's asking price ($1,500,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation and John's alternative offer. It doesn't make financial sense for me to pay $700,000 more than what the product is worth to me.
