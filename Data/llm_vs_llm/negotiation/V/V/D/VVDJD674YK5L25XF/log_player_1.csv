Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $18500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I cannot accept $8,000 as this is below my minimum threshold. The product has significant value with its premium features and quality. I understand budget concerns, so I'm willing to reduce my initial price. My counteroffer is $16,000. This represents a substantial discount from my original price while reflecting the true value of the product. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my budget and reducing the price. However, $16000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget, and I'm willing to make a deal if we can meet at this price.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, and I appreciate your increased offer to $9,000. However, I need to be transparent that I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase at $10,000. Given that information, I cannot accept less than that amount. My new offer is $14,000, which still represents a significant discount from my original price. This product offers exceptional value at this price point. If your budget constraints are firm, perhaps we could discuss what specific features are most important to you, as I do want to try to reach an agreement that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
