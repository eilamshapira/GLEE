Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I cannot accept $8000 as this is below my minimum threshold. The product has significant value with its premium features and quality. I understand budget concerns, so I'm willing to reduce my initial price. My counteroffer is $16000. This represents a substantial discount from my original price while reflecting the true value of the product. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, and I appreciate your increased offer to $9000. However, I need to be transparent that I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase at $10000. Given that information, I cannot accept less than that amount. My new offer is $14000, which still represents a significant discount from my original price. This product offers exceptional value at this price point. If your budget constraints are firm, perhaps we could discuss what specific features are most important to you, as I do want to try to reach an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.
