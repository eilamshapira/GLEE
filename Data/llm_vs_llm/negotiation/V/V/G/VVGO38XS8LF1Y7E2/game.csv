"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $400000. I believe this is a fair price for the product.",400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, the price of $400000 is substantially lower than what I am willing to accept. I am willing to come down from my initial price of $3000000 and offer you the product for $2500000 to find a middle ground.",2500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2500000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $500000, which I believe is a reasonable price for the product.",500000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. However, $500000 is still much lower than what I am willing to accept. I understand that we need to find a middle ground here. I am willing to come down to $2000000. This is a significant reduction from my initial asking price.",2000000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really motivated to close this deal with you. I've reassessed my bottom line and I'm willing to offer you the product for $1900000. This is a steep discount from my original asking price, and I believe it reflects a fair market value for the product.",1900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and the significant discount you've offered. However, $1900000 is still out of my reach. I'm willing to increase my offer to $600000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. I hope this can be a starting point for further discussion.",600000.0,Bob,6,
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. However, your offer of $600000 is still too low for me to accept. I'm willing to make another significant reduction to $1700000 . This is a big concession on my part, and I hope it shows my commitment to making this deal happen.",1700000.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we are trying to bridge a gap here. I am willing to make another concession and lower my price to $1600000 . This is very close to my bottom line, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1600000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1600000 is still out of my reach. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $700000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options.",700000.0,Bob,8,
