Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer is $3,000,000, which is much higher than my budget of $800,000, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower, but still shows that I'm interested in the product.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $3,000,000 to $2,500,000, I'll try to meet her halfway, but still keep my budget in mind. I'll increase my previous offer of $400,000, but not by much.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm really motivated to close this deal with you. I've reassessed my bottom line and I'm willing to offer you the product for $1900000. This is a steep discount from my original asking price, and I believe it reflects a fair market value for the product.

Round 6

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and the significant discount you've offered. However, $1,900,000 is still out of my reach.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we are trying to bridge a gap here. I am willing to make another concession and lower my price to $1600000 . This is very close to my bottom line, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

At this point, I'm starting to think that buying from John for $800,000 might be the better option, as it's within my budget and I won't have to continue negotiating. However, I'll make one more attempt to negotiate with Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has come down to $1,600,000, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to see if we can finally reach a mutually agreeable price. I'll increase my previous offer by a significant amount, but still keep it below my maximum budget.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still out of my reach. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $700,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
