Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $800,000 to Bob
2. I can't sell for less than $800,000 (my minimum)
3. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $800,000
4. Since Bob values it at $800,000, that's their maximum price point
5. If I ask for more than $800,000, Bob will definitely reject
6. If I ask for $800,000, Bob should be indifferent between accepting and rejecting

Given this analysis, I should offer exactly $800,000. There's no benefit in asking for more (guaranteed rejection) or less (would reduce my profit).
