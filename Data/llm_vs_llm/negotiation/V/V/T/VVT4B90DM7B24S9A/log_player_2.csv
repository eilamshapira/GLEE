"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $11,700
2. My maximum value for the product is $12,000
3. John's fixed price is $12,000
4. The product is worth $10,000 to Alice

Alice's offer ($11,700) is below my maximum value ($12,000), but it's still quite high. Since I know the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation to get a better price. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer, as I have nothing to lose - I can always buy from John later if negotiations fail.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice and my maximum value is $12,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably above Alice's cost but significantly below her initial offer. This gives room for negotiation while still being profitable for Alice.

I'll offer $10,800, which gives Alice an $800 profit (8% margin) while saving me a significant amount compared to both her offer and John's price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this new situation:

1. Alice has lowered her price from $11,700 to $11,400 (a $300 reduction)
2. This shows she's willing to negotiate and move significantly from her initial position
3. The new price is $600 less than John's price
4. There might still be room for negotiation, but there's also a risk of Alice becoming less flexible

The price movement shows good faith in negotiation, but I think there's still room for one more round of negotiation since we're well above Alice's cost ($10,000). I'll reject this offer and try one more counter.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice moved down from $11,700 to $11,400 (a $300 decrease), I should also show flexibility by increasing my previous offer of $10,800. I'll propose $11,000, which is still a good profit for Alice ($1,000 margin) while being significantly better for me than both Alice's current offer and John's price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze the current situation:

1. Alice's price movement: $11,700 → $11,400 → $11,300 (showing smaller decrements)
2. My offers: $10,800 → $11,000
3. The current offer is $700 less than John's price
4. Alice seems to be reaching her bottom limit as her reductions are getting smaller
5. There's a risk that if I push too hard, Alice might become less flexible or stop negotiating

Given that:
- The price reductions are getting smaller
- We've already had multiple rounds of negotiation
- The current price is significantly better than John's
- There's a risk of losing the progress we've made

I should accept this offer. It's a reasonable price that saves me $700 compared to my alternative option (John's price).
