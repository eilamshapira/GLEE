"Hello Bob, I have a product I'd like to sell to you. It's a high-quality item that I know will be valuable to you. I'm offering it at $100. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. Would you be interested?",100.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. Unfortunately, $60 is too low for me as this product is worth at least $80 to me. I could come down to $90, which I think is quite reasonable given the quality and value of the item. How does that sound?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $90. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $70. This is the highest I'm willing to go at this point, and I believe it's a fair compromise between our two valuations of the product. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer to $70, but that's still below what I can accept. The product is worth at least $80 to me, which is actually the price another buyer, John, is willing to pay. However, I'd prefer to sell it to you if we can reach a fair agreement. Would you consider $85? This is my final offer and represents a significant discount from my initial price.",85.0,Alice,5,
