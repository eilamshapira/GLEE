Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product I'd like to sell to you. It's a high-quality item that I know will be valuable to you. I'm offering it at $100.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Would you be willing to consider this offer?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. Unfortunately, $60 is too low for me as this product is worth at least $80 to me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $90. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $70. This is the highest I'm willing to go at this point, and I believe it's a fair compromise between our two valuations of the product. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer to $70, but that's still below what I can accept. The product is worth at least $80 to me, which is actually the price another buyer, John, is willing to pay. However, I'd prefer to sell it to you if we can reach a fair agreement. Would you consider $85? This is my final offer and represents a significant discount from my initial price."", ""product_price"": 85}"
