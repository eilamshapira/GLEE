Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. Unfortunately, $60 is too low for me as this product is worth at least $80 to me. I could come down to $90, which I think is quite reasonable given the quality and value of the item. How does that sound?

Round 5

Would you consider $85? This is my final offer and represents a significant discount from my initial price.
