"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will bring great value to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to let it go for a price of $17000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. Let me know if you're interested!",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be transparent with you. Your asking price of $17000 is significantly above what I'm prepared to pay. I've actually received an alternative offer from another seller for $10000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $8500 for the product. This gives you a quicker sale without having to find another buyer. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your transparency and for sharing the alternative offer you received. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I must say that $8500 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value. I'm willing to make a compromise and meet you halfway between my initial offer and your proposed price, but taking into account the value of the product. I can offer the product to you for $13250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go without compromising the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13250.0,Alice,3,
