Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be transparent with you. Your asking price of $17000 is significantly above what I'm prepared to pay. I've actually received an alternative offer from another seller for $10000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $8500 for the product. This gives you a quicker sale without having to find another buyer. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I will make a counteroffer to Bob. My message: 
""Hello Bob, thank you for your transparency and for sharing the alternative offer you received. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I must say that $8,500 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value. I'm willing to make a compromise and meet you halfway between my initial offer and your proposed price. I can offer the product to you for $13,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go without compromising the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."""
