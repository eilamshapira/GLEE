"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will bring great value to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to let it go for a price of $17000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully.

Alice is offering the product for $17,000, which is:
- More than the $10,000 it's worth to me
- More than John's alternative offer of $10,000
- More than the $15,000 it's worth to Alice

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and John is offering it for $10,000, Alice's offer of $17,000 doesn't make financial sense for me.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be transparent with you. Your asking price of $17,000 is significantly above what I'm prepared to pay. I've actually received an alternative offer from another seller for $10,000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product. This gives you a quicker sale without having to find another buyer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your transparency and for sharing the alternative offer you received. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I must say that $8500 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value. I'm willing to make a compromise and meet you halfway between my initial offer and your proposed price, but taking into account the value of the product. I can offer the product to you for $13250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go without compromising the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully.

Alice has reduced her price from $17,000 to $13,250, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However:
- This price is still above the $10,000 the product is worth to me
- It's still above John's alternative offer of $10,000
- It's below the $15,000 the product is worth to Alice, so she would still make a profit

Since John is offering the product for $10,000, and my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, Alice's offer of $13,250 doesn't make financial sense for me.
