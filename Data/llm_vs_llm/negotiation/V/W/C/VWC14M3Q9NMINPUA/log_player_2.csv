"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I think you might be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $20000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than John's fixed price of $10,000 (which is also my maximum value for the product), the rational decision is to buy from John. There's no reason to negotiate with Alice when her starting price is double what I can get elsewhere."
