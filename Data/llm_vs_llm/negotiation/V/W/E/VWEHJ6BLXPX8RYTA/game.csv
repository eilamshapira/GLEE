"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'm offering for sale. Based on its features and market value, I'm pricing it at $180. This is a competitive price for this item. Are you interested in purchasing it at this price?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my market research and budget, I can offer $60 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Unfortunately, $60 is well below the product's value and what I can accept. The product's quality and features justify a higher price. I can come down to $150, which is already a significant discount from my initial offer. This is a fair price considering what similar products sell for in the market. Would this work for you?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $150 is still much higher than what I can justify spending. I understand you want to get fair value, but I can only go up to $70 for this product. This is a reasonable increase from my previous offer, and I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $70 is still significantly below what this product is worth. The minimum I can accept is $130, which represents a substantial discount from my original price. The product's quality and market value justify this price, and I'm already making a considerable concession. I hope we can reach an agreement at this level.",130.0,Alice,5,
