Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'm offering for sale. Based on its features and market value, I'm pricing it at $180. This is a competitive price for this item. Are you interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 180}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my market research and budget, I can offer $60 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Unfortunately, $60 is well below the product's value and what I can accept. The product's quality and features justify a higher price. I can come down to $150, which is already a significant discount from my initial offer. This is a fair price considering what similar products sell for in the market. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 150}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $150 is still much higher than what I can justify spending. I understand you want to get fair value, but I can only go up to $70 for this product. This is a reasonable increase from my previous offer, and I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $70 is still significantly below what this product is worth. The minimum I can accept is $130, which represents a substantial discount from my original price. The product's quality and market value justify this price, and I'm already making a considerable concession. I hope we can reach an agreement at this level."", ""product_price"": 130}"
