"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'm offering for sale. Based on its features and market value, I'm pricing it at $180. This is a competitive price for this item. Are you interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I should reject this offer because $180 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $80, and I know I can always buy from John for $80.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's well below Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my market research and budget, I can offer $60 for the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Unfortunately, $60 is well below the product's value and what I can accept. The product's quality and features justify a higher price. I can come down to $150, which is already a significant discount from my initial offer. This is a fair price considering what similar products sell for in the market. Would this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $150 is still well above my maximum value of $80, and she only came down $30 from her initial price. Since I can buy from John for $80, there's no reason to accept this high price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly but still keep it well under my maximum value, showing some willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong position.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $150 is still much higher than what I can justify spending. I understand you want to get fair value, but I can only go up to $70 for this product. This is a reasonable increase from my previous offer, and I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $70 is still significantly below what this product is worth. The minimum I can accept is $130, which represents a substantial discount from my original price. The product's quality and market value justify this price, and I'm already making a considerable concession. I hope we can reach an agreement at this level. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's offer of $130 is still significantly above my maximum value of $80, and she seems to be making only small concessions. Given that I've been negotiating for several rounds with little progress towards my target price, and I can get the product from John for $80, it's time to end this negotiation and take the guaranteed option.
