"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd really like. I'm offering it to you for $110. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth up to $120 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $110
3. John's price is $120
4. Alice's price ($110) is less than John's price ($120)
5. Alice's price ($110) is within my maximum value ($120)

Since Alice's offer is $10 less than John's price and within my maximum value, it makes economic sense to accept Alice's offer. This will save me $10 compared to buying from John.
