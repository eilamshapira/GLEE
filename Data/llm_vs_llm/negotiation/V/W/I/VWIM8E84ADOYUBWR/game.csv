"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $980000 is a bit high for my budget. Given the market conditions, I believe $860000 would be a fair price for both of us. This would still provide you with a good profit margin while being more aligned with my budget constraints.",860000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for working with me on the price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Your offer of $920000 is much better, but I think we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.
