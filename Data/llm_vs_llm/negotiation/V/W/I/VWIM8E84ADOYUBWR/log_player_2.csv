"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this unique product with you. I'm offering it to you for $980000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth up to $1,200,000 to me
2. Alice's cost is $800,000
3. Alice's initial offer is $980,000
4. John's fixed price is $1,200,000

Alice's offer of $980,000 is significantly better than John's price of $1,200,000, saving $220,000. However, since this is just the first round and Alice's cost is $800,000, there might be room for negotiation to get an even better price. Given that we have 10 rounds to negotiate, it would be strategic to reject this initial offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but leaves room for negotiation. Since Alice's cost is $800,000 and her initial offer was $980,000, I'll propose a price that's closer to the middle ground.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $980,000 is a bit high for my budget. Given the market conditions, I believe $860,000 would be a fair price for both of us. This would still provide you with a good profit margin while being more aligned with my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 860000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your proposal, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget, I can offer it to you for $920000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product. Looking forward to your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let's analyze the current situation:

1. Alice has reduced her price from $980,000 to $920,000 - a $60,000 reduction
2. This is significantly better than John's price of $1,200,000
3. Alice's cost is $800,000, and she's now asking for $920,000, giving her a $120,000 profit
4. We still have 7 more rounds possible for negotiation
5. Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by making a substantial reduction

While $920,000 is a good price compared to John's offer, there might still be room for a bit more negotiation since Alice has shown flexibility. However, we don't want to push too hard and risk losing the progress we've made.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down from $980,000 to $920,000, showing good faith in negotiations, I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that moves up from my previous $860,000, but still tries to get a better deal.

{""message"": ""Thank you for working with me on the price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Your offer of $920,000 is much better, but I think we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. I can offer $890,000, which would still provide you with a solid profit margin while being more manageable for my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 890000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued interest and negotiation, Bob! I understand your position, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $900000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let's analyze the current situation:

1. Alice has moved from $920,000 to $900,000
2. This is just $10,000 above my last offer of $890,000
3. The price is now $300,000 less than John's price
4. Alice has shown consistent willingness to negotiate, moving from $980,000 → $920,000 → $900,000
5. The current price gives Alice a $100,000 profit (reasonable)
6. We're halfway through our negotiation rounds
7. The gap between our positions has narrowed significantly

Given that Alice has been reasonable throughout the negotiation and we're now only $10,000 apart, continuing to negotiate might risk damaging the goodwill we've built. The current offer of $900,000 represents a fair deal for both parties and is significantly better than our alternative with John.
