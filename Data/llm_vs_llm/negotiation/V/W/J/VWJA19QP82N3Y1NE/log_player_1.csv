Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me make an initial offer to Bob. Since I know the product is worth at least $10,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation while potentially maximizing my profit.

{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly the same as John's guaranteed offer ($10,000), and it's equal to my minimum acceptable price, there's no advantage in accepting Bob's offer over John's. However, since Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in hopes of securing a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob countered with $10,000, which shows he's interested but trying to negotiate down to the minimum, I'll lower my price from the initial $15,000 but still try to secure a profit above my minimum.

{""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob has offered $11,500, which is $1,500 more than both my minimum acceptable price and John's guaranteed offer. This is a good offer that provides a reasonable profit above my minimum. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Bob might withdraw or reduce his offer. I'll accept this offer.
