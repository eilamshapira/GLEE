"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","The optimal decision is to buy from John. Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than my valuation of $8,000 and John's price. Even with negotiation, it is unlikely Alice will drop her price below $8,000 given her valuation of $15,000.
