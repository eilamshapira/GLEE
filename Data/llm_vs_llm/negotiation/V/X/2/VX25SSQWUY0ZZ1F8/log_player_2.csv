"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to acquire this unique product. Considering its exclusivity and inherent value, I'm offering it to you for a price of. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, but the product is only worth up to $1,000,000 to me. Paying $1,200,000 would mean I'm paying more than the product's value to me, which doesn't make financial sense.

John is offering the same product for $1,000,000, which matches the maximum value I place on the product.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and John's offer is $200,000 less than Alice's, the rational choice is to buy from John.
