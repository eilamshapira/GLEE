"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","$80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120, so I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial price but still maintain a good margin above my minimum of $120.

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","$90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and since Bob's incremental increase was only $10 (from $80 to $90), it seems unlikely we'll reach a price above $120. Given this, and to avoid wasting more time, I'll take the guaranteed $120 from John.
