"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1100000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $2300000 represents a fair value for this product, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $1700000? This reflects my willingness to work with you while still acknowledging the inherent worth of what I'm offering.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $1300000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. It seems we're getting closer. How about we split the difference again and settle at $1500000?  This is my final offer, as it represents the very lowest price I'm willing to accept.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
