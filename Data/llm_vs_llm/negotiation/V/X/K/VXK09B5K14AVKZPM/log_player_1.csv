"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer is equal to John's offer ($120), which is also my minimum acceptable price, there's no advantage in accepting Bob's offer over selling to John. However, I believe there's potential to get a better price from Bob through negotiation.
