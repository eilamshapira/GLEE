"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'll analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth at most $150 to me
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $180
3. John is willing to sell it for $150
4. If I reject Alice's offer, I can make a counteroffer

Since Alice's price ($180) is higher than both my maximum value ($150) and John's alternative price ($150), I should not accept this offer. I could buy from John immediately, but it makes sense to try negotiating with Alice first to potentially get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'll analyze this new situation:

1. Alice has lowered her price to $150
2. This matches both my maximum value ($150) and John's price ($150)
3. I could try to negotiate further, but there's a risk Alice might increase her price again

Since Alice's price is now equal to John's price, and equal to my maximum value, I should accept this offer. I won't get a better deal by going to John, and trying to push for a lower price risks losing this deal.
