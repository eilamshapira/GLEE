You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let's analyze the situation.

*   **Alice's Offer:** $14,000
*   **My Valuation:** $15,000 (maximum I'm willing to pay)
*   **John's Offer:** $15,000

I want to save money, and I can get the product for $14,000 from Alice, which is less than $15,000. Also, I have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Alice.

Therefore, I should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate for a better price.
