"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll analyze the situation:

- Alice is offering the product for $14,000
- The product is worth up to $15,000 to me (Bob)
- The product is worth $10,000 to Alice
- I can buy from John for $15,000 as a last resort

Alice's current offer of $14,000 saves me $1,000 compared to John's price, but there's likely room for negotiation since Alice's cost is only $10,000. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer to try getting a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice that's reasonable but gives me more savings:

{""product_price"": $12,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll analyze the updated situation:

- Alice has lowered her price from $14,000 to $13,500
- This shows she's willing to negotiate, but hasn't come down much
- The product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so she still has room to reduce the price
- I'm saving $1,500 compared to John's price with this offer

Alice dropped her price, but not significantly. There's still room for negotiation since she can go much lower and remain profitable. I'll reject and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer to Alice, slightly increasing my previous offer to show I'm willing to move in her direction while still seeking a better deal:

{""product_price"": $12,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll analyze the updated situation:

- Alice has now lowered her price to $13,000, down from her initial $14,000
- This represents another $500 reduction from her previous offer
- She's showing continued willingness to negotiate
- At $13,000, I'm saving $2,000 compared to John's price
- The product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so she still has some margin

Alice is gradually coming down in price, showing she's serious about making a deal. While I could push for more, $13,000 represents a good compromise - she makes $3,000 profit and I save $2,000 compared to my alternative. This is a reasonable price point that benefits both of us.
