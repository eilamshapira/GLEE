"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $25000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $5000 for the product. What do you think?",5000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. However, $5000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. Let me propose a more reasonable price for both of us. How about $20000?",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the value of this product justifies a higher price. Let's meet in the middle. How about $18000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still too high for me. I can go up to $6000. Is that something you can work with?",6000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6000 is still below my minimum. Let's try to find a fair price. How about $15000? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and should reflect a good compromise.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're still apart on the price. I'm willing to come down further to $13000. This is a very competitive offer, and I believe it represents a great value for the product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, thank you for your increased offer, but $7000 is still not enough. Let's try to close this gap. How about $12000? This is my final significant reduction, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower the price to $11000. This is very close to my minimum, and I hope it fits within your budget. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I understand we're close to finding a solution. My final offer is $10500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price for the value of the product. Can we close the deal at this price?",10500.0,Alice,9,
