"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price around $600000. Would that work for you?",600000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. However, $600000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $900000 to meet you halfway. What do you think?",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to maintain a fair value for the product. I'm willing to lower the price to $850000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my desire to work with you. Please let me know if this is something we can agree on.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I am looking to spend no more than $700000. Can we meet in the middle?",700000.0,Bob,4,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, $700000 is still below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to go down to $825000, which is a fair compromise given the value of the product. Let me know if you can meet me at this price.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer, but I need to ensure the value of the product is respected. I'm prepared to lower the price further to $810000. This is my best offer at this point, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",810000.0,Alice,5,
