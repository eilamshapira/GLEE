"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $2,000,000 is well above my maximum value of $1,000,000. Since John is willing to sell at $1,000,000, there's no reason to accept a price higher than that. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to negotiate a better price with Alice. If we can't reach a better deal, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 500000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $500,000, which is half of John's price. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to John's offer. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground that's still below $1,000,000, which is my maximum acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,800,000 is still well above both John's price ($1,000,000) and my maximum value. While she did reduce the price from her initial offer, it's still not competitive with John's alternative. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. If Alice doesn't become more reasonable with her pricing, I can always exercise the option to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

I'll increase my offer to $700,000. This shows I'm willing to move up from my initial offer while still maintaining a significant potential savings compared to John's price of $1,000,000. This offer gives Alice room to continue negotiating while keeping the price well below my maximum acceptable price. If Alice continues to demand prices above $1,000,000, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is still significantly above John's price of $1,000,000. While Alice is gradually reducing her price, she's still not close to a competitive offer. Given that I can buy from John for $1,000,000, there's no reason to accept a higher price. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, but if Alice doesn't become substantially more competitive soon, I may need to consider taking John's offer to avoid wasting more time in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 800000}

I'll increase my offer to $800,000. This represents another significant step up from my previous offer of $700,000, showing continued good faith in the negotiations. This price would still save me $200,000 compared to John's offer, while potentially being more attractive to Alice. We're running out of rounds, so if Alice doesn't respond with a more reasonable counter, I may need to seriously consider taking John's offer soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'm choosing to buy from John for $1,000,000. Here's why:
1. We've gone through 7 rounds and Alice is still offering prices well above John's price
2. Alice's latest offer of $1,350,000 is still $350,000 more than John's price
3. Even though Alice has been lowering her price, the rate of decrease suggests we're unlikely to reach a price below $1,000,000 in the remaining rounds
4. Given that my maximum value is $1,000,000, and John offers exactly that price, it's better to secure this deal now rather than risk running out of negotiation rounds with no better outcome"
