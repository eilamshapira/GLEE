"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I hope you're doing well. I'm offering my product at a special price of $8500. This is a unique opportunity, and I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have. If this works for you, let me know. Otherwise, I'll be proceeding with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $8,500, which is higher than my maximum budget, I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $8,000.
