"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to consider this carefully. Alice's offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value ($12,000) and is also much higher than John's fixed price of $12,000.

Since Alice's initial offer is more than twice what I'm willing to pay, and even higher than my alternative option with John, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her price from $25,000 to $22,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $22,000 is still significantly higher than my maximum value of $12,000, and it's also higher than John's fixed price of $12,000.

Since I can buy the product from John for $12,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay anyway, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer.

You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her price further to $20,000, which shows she's continuing to negotiate. However, $20,000 is still significantly higher than my maximum value of $12,000, and it's also higher than John's fixed price of $12,000.

Since I can buy the product from John for $12,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay anyway, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice continues to reduce her price, but at $19,000 it's still well above both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's fixed price ($12,000). 

Alice's negotiation pattern suggests she's making small concessions, but we're still far from reaching a price that would be acceptable to me. With only a few rounds left and such a large gap, it makes more sense to go with John's offer.
