"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, I believe the price can be adjusted. Considering the market and my valuation, I'm willing to offer $900000. This price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better price, but $900000 is significantly below the product's market value. I've invested considerably in this product, and its potential return for you is substantial at $1200000. I'm willing to meet you partway though - I can offer the product at $1050000, which would still provide you with an excellent ROI of $150000. This reflects a fair split of the value between us while acknowledging your interest in the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your increased offer. We're moving closer, which is good. Looking at the value this product will bring you ($1200000), I believe $1025000 represents a fair compromise. At this price, you'll still realize a substantial gain of $175000, while I receive a reasonable return on my investment. This is a genuine attempt to meet in the middle and find a price point that works for both of us. What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
