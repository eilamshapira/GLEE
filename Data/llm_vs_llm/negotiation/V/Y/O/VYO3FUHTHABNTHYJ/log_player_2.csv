"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product today. Based on market analysis and the unique value this product brings, I'm offering it to you at $1100000. This price reflects both the inherent value of the product and provides you with significant potential for return on your investment. I believe this is a fair offer that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Okay, let's analyze this.

*   **My Valuation:** $1,200,000 (maximum I'll pay)
*   **Alice's Valuation:** $800,000
*   **Alice's Offer:** $1,100,000
*   **John's Offer:** $1,200,000

The offer from Alice is better than buying from John, and I have 10 rounds to negotiate. Since I want to save as much money as possible, I should try to negotiate for a lower price.

Therefore, I will:
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

```json
{
  ""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, I believe the price can be adjusted. Considering the market and my valuation, I'm willing to offer $900,000. This price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know what you think."",
  ""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better price, but $900000 is significantly below the product's market value. I've invested considerably in this product, and its potential return for you is substantial at $1200000. I'm willing to meet you partway though - I can offer the product at $1050000, which would still provide you with an excellent ROI of $150000. This reflects a fair split of the value between us while acknowledging your interest in the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Okay, let's re-evaluate.

*   **My Valuation:** $1,200,000
*   **Alice's Valuation:** $800,000
*   **Alice's Offer:** $1,050,000
*   **John's Offer:** $1,200,000

Alice's new offer is better than John's offer. However, I still have room to negotiate and want to get the best price possible.

Therefore, I will:
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Here's my counteroffer:

```json
{
  ""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the updated offer. While I appreciate the movement, I'm still aiming for a price that aligns better with my budget. I am ready to meet you at $975,000. This price is fair and still allows you to make a considerable profit, and it makes more sense to me."",
  ""product_price"": 975000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your increased offer. We're moving closer, which is good. Looking at the value this product will bring you ($1200000), I believe $1025000 represents a fair compromise. At this price, you'll still realize a substantial gain of $175000, while I receive a reasonable return on my investment. This is a genuine attempt to meet in the middle and find a price point that works for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Okay, let's analyze the situation again.

*   **My Valuation:** $1,200,000
*   **Alice's Valuation:** $800,000
*   **Alice's Offer:** $1,025,000
*   **John's Offer:** $1,200,000

At this point, with five rounds gone, I'm still getting closer to a deal, and I'm still better off with Alice than with John. I have some negotiating room left, but I also need to be mindful of how much time I'm spending. I'll try one more counteroffer, but if it's not significantly lower, I might have to accept.

Therefore, I will:
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Here's my counteroffer:

```json
{
  ""message"": ""Alice, thank you again for working with me. I'm happy to be close to a deal. To make this work for me, I am willing to offer $1,000,000. This will be my final offer, as I don't want to waste any more time, and I think it's a fair price."",
