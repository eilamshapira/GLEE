"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I hope this message finds you well. I'm offering you this product, which I believe can provide good value. However, I should let you know that I already have another buyer, John, who is willing to purchase it for $120. Given that I have this alternative offer, I need to price it accordingly. Would you be interested in purchasing the product for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}"
