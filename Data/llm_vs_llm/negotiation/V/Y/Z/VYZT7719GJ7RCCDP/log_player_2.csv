"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to analyze this offer carefully:

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for exactly $12,000. This is the same price that John is willing to sell it for.

Since Alice's current offer ($12,000) is equal to the maximum I'm willing to pay and equal to John's price, there's no advantage in accepting this particular offer from Alice. However, by rejecting and making a counteroffer, I might be able to save some money.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice that's reasonably lower than her asking price but still fair considering the product's value.
