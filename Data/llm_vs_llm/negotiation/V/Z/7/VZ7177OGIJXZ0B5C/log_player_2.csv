"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe might be of interest to you. It's a high-value item and I'm offering it to you for $2000000. Let me know if you're interested or if you have a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since the offered price of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than the maximum value of $800,000 that the product is worth to me, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of negotiating a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I don't know the value of the product to Alice, I'll start with a low offer and see how she responds.

{""message"": ""Thank you for offering the product to me, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products."", ""product_price"": 400000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but my product is of exceptional value and I cannot agree to $400000. I can offer it to you at $1800000. Please let me know how you would like to proceed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,800,000 is still significantly higher than the maximum value of $800,000 that the product is worth to me. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $800,000, I will reject Alice's offer again and try to negotiate a better price.

However, I will also consider the fact that Alice has already reduced the price from $2,000,000 to $1,800,000, which shows that she is willing to negotiate. I will make another counteroffer, but this time I will try to meet Alice halfway.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I will send a new counteroffer to Alice:

{""message"": ""Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that your product is of exceptional value, but I still cannot agree to $1,800,000. I can offer $600,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I hope we can meet in the middle and come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
