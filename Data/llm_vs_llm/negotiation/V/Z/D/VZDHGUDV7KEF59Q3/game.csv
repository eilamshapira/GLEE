"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is significantly above market value for this product. I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Given this market reality, I would like to make a counteroffer of $8500. This still provides you with a good profit margin while being more competitive with market rates. Would you consider this offer?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in doing business with me. While I understand you mentioned another seller offering the product for $10000, I should clarify that my product has unique qualities that justify its value. However, I'm willing to be flexible. I can't accept $8500 as that's below my minimum acceptable price, but I can offer you the product for $12000, which represents a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price reflects both the true value of the product and my desire to establish a business relationship with you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
