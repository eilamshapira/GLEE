Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is significantly above market value for this product. I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Given this market reality, I would like to make a counteroffer of $8500. This still provides you with a good profit margin while being more competitive with market rates. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in doing business with me. While I understand you mentioned another seller offering the product for $10,000, I should clarify that my product has unique qualities that justify its value. However, I'm willing to be flexible. I can't accept $8,500 as that's below my minimum acceptable price, but I can offer you the product for $12,000, which represents a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price reflects both the true value of the product and my desire to establish a business relationship with you."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
