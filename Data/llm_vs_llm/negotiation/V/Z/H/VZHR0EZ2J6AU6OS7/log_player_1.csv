"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start by making a relatively high offer to maximize my potential earnings. I can always adjust my price later based on Bob's response.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($8,000), but I still don't know the maximum price Bob is willing to pay, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

My counteroffer will be slightly lower than my initial offer, to show that I'm willing to negotiate.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob was willing to pay $10,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. This will give me a chance to negotiate and potentially get a better price.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's new offer of $10,500 is higher than his previous offer, which suggests that he's interested in the product and willing to pay a premium for it. Since $10,500 is a good price, and I don't know if Bob will be willing to pay more, I'll choose to accept his offer.
