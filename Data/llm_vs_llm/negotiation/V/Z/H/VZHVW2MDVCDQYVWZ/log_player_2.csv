"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer is the same price as John's ($12,000), and the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. Alice's minimum acceptable price should be around $10,000 (since that's what it's worth to her), so there's room for negotiation to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's cost but still gives her some profit. I'll start relatively low to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 10500}

This offer gives Alice a $500 profit over her cost ($10,000), while saving me $1,500 compared to both Alice's initial offer and John's price. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her price by $500 from her initial offer, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still quite high considering her cost is $10,000. Since we still have several rounds left and she's showing flexibility, I'll reject this offer and try another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still try to get a good deal. Since Alice came down $500 from her initial offer, I'll move up a similar amount from my last offer.

{""product_price"": 11000}

This offer splits the difference between my last offer ($10,500) and Alice's last offer ($11,500). It would give Alice a $1,000 profit while still saving me $1,000 compared to John's price. It's a fair compromise that shows I'm willing to move toward her price while still seeking a better deal than the alternative."
