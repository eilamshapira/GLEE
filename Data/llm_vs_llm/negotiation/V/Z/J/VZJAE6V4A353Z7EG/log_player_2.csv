"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since I know the product is worth $100 to Alice and I have 10 rounds to negotiate, I'll reject this first offer of $115. It's too close to John's price of $120, and there's room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 105}

I'll offer $105, which is slightly above Alice's cost of $100. This gives Alice a small profit while still being significantly better than John's price of $120. This leaves room for negotiation if Alice counters, but also presents a reasonable starting point that could be acceptable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer of $110. This is a reasonable price as it:
1. Saves me $10 compared to John's price of $120
2. Gives Alice a fair profit of $10 above her cost
3. While we could potentially negotiate further, the $110 price point is a good compromise and there's always a risk of losing the deal if we push too hard"
