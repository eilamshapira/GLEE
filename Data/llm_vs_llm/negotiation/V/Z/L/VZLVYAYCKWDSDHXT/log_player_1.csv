Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high price, considering the product is worth $150 to Bob, but leave some room for negotiation if needed.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $100 is significantly higher than John's $80, but still quite below the product's value to Bob ($150), I'll reject and make another counteroffer. There's room for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still maintain a good profit margin.
