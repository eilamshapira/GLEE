"Hi Alice! Thank you for the offer, but $20000 is quite beyond my budget. I'm very interested in the product, and I think $8000 would be a reasonable price for it. Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget concerns, I can't go as low as $8000. How about I offer it to you for $18000? I believe it's a fair price for its value. Let me know your thoughts!",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit, but $18000 is still over my limit. How about $9000? I’m sure we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob! I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I understand your position, I can't accept $9000. How about we meet halfway? I can offer it to you for $16000. I think that would be a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to work with me on the price, but $16000 is still more than I can spend. Would you consider $10000? I believe that’s a good compromise and it matches the offer I have from another seller.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob! Thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10000 is still too low for me. How about I offer you the product for $15500? I believe that's a fair compromise considering its value. Let me know your thoughts!",15500.0,Alice,7,
