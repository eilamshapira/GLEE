Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that you're looking for a lower price point. Unfortunately, $8000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down from my initial offer. Would you consider $12000 instead? This price reflects the product's high quality and value. I believe it's a fair price for both of us.
