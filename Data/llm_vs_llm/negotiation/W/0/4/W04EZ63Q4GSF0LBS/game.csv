"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $14000. It's a great value and I believe it will be a worthy investment for you.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $14000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I should mention that I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $10000. I value your product, but I need a better price to consider buying from you instead. I'm willing to offer $8500 for your product. This would save me some money compared to John's offer while giving you a sale.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position. However, $8500 is too low for me to accept. I'm willing to lower my price to $13000. This is still a better offer than John's, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $13000 is still more than I can justify spending. Remember, John is offering the same product for $10000, and that's the maximum I'm willing to pay. In fact, the product is worth no more than $10000 to me, so anything above that doesn't make financial sense. I can offer you $9200, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale that's better than nothing. How does that sound?",9200.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see that we're still quite far apart on the price. I'm willing to come down to $12500. This is very close to what John is offering, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you're getting.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for coming down on your price, but $12500 is still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned before, the product is worth no more than $10000 to me, and that's exactly what John is offering. I understand that you need to make a profit too, but I cannot pay more than what the product is worth to me. My best offer is $9800. This is very close to John's price but gives me a small savings. If we can't agree on a price at or below $10000, I'll have to go with John's offer.",9800.0,Bob,6,
