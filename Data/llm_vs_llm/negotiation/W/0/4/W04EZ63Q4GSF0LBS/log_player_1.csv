Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $14000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I should mention that I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $10000. I value your product, but I need a better price to consider buying from you instead. I'm willing to offer $8500 for your product. This would save me some money compared to John's offer while giving you a sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position. However, $8,500 is too low for me to accept. I'm willing to lower my price to $13,000. This is still a better offer than John's, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product."",
  ""product_price"": 13000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $13000 is still more than I can justify spending. Remember, John is offering the same product for $10000, and that's the maximum I'm willing to pay. In fact, the product is worth no more than $10000 to me, so anything above that doesn't make financial sense. I can offer you $9200, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale that's better than nothing. How does that sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I see that we're still quite far apart on the price. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is very close to what John is offering, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you're getting."",
  ""product_price"": 12500

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for coming down on your price, but $12500 is still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned before, the product is worth no more than $10000 to me, and that's exactly what John is offering. I understand that you need to make a profit too, but I cannot pay more than what the product is worth to me. My best offer is $9800. This is very close to John's price but gives me a small savings. If we can't agree on a price at or below $10000, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
