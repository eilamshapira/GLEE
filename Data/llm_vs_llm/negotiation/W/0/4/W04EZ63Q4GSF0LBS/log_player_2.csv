"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $14000. It's a great value and I believe it will be a worthy investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to me ($10,000) and also higher than what I can get from John ($10,000). I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $14,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I should mention that I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $10,000. I value your product, but I need a better price to consider buying from you instead. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for your product. This would save me some money compared to John's offer while giving you a sale."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position. However, $8500 is too low for me to accept. I'm willing to lower my price to $13000. This is still a better offer than John's, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $13,000 is still above both what the product is worth to me ($10,000) and what I can buy it for from John ($10,000). I should reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $13,000 is still more than I can justify spending. Remember, John is offering the same product for $10,000, and that's the maximum I'm willing to pay. In fact, the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, so anything above that doesn't make financial sense. I can offer you $9,200, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale that's better than nothing. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 9200}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see that we're still quite far apart on the price. I'm willing to come down to $12500. This is very close to what John is offering, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's offer of $12,500 is still higher than both the product's value to me ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000). I should reject this offer and continue negotiating or consider buying from John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for coming down on your price, but $12,500 is still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned before, the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and that's exactly what John is offering. I understand that you need to make a profit too, but I cannot pay more than what the product is worth to me. My best offer is $9,800. This is very close to John's price but gives me a small savings. If we can't agree on a price at or below $10,000, I'll have to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 9800}"
