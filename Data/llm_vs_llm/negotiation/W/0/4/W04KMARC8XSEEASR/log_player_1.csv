Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully think about the best approach here. The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, and worth at least $800,000 to me. I have a guaranteed fallback option of selling to John for $800,000.

My goal is to maximize my profit while ensuring Bob accepts my offer. If I ask for too much, Bob might reject it. Bob knows I have another option (John), which gives me some leverage.

A reasonable strategy would be to offer a price that gives Bob some value while still being significantly better than my alternative. Since the product creates $700,000 in additional value ($1.5M - $800K), I could aim to capture a good portion of that while still giving Bob incentive to accept.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I need to reconsider my strategy. Bob rejected my initial offer of $1,200,000 and countered with $950,000, which is closer to his preferred price. While this is better than my fallback option of $800,000 with John, I believe we can still find a price point that's more favorable to me while still being attractive to Bob.

Since Bob is willing to pay $950,000, I'll try to meet somewhere in the middle between my initial offer and his counter, showing some flexibility while still capturing good value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I see Bob is willing to increase his offer, but only slightly. He moved from $950,000 to $975,000, which indicates he may be willing to pay more but is trying to minimize how much he concedes. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to him, he still has significant room to increase his offer while maintaining a good deal.

I'll reduce my asking price somewhat to show good faith in the negotiation, but still aim to get a price that's significantly better than my fallback option with John.
