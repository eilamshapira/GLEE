"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer and my alternatives.

Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is less than the $1,500,000 maximum I'm willing to pay. It's also less than John's fixed price of $1,500,000.

However, since the product is only worth $800,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation to reach a better price. I should reject this initial offer and make a counteroffer that's better for me while still providing Alice with a profit.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has come down from her initial offer of $1,200,000 to $1,075,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is a substantial improvement, but I believe there's still room for a better deal since the product is only worth $800,000 to her.

$1,075,000 is significantly better than John's price of $1,500,000, but I think I can get an even better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has lowered her price again to $1,025,000, which shows she's continuing to negotiate in good faith. We're making progress toward finding a middle ground.

At this point, Alice has come down from $1,200,000 to $1,025,000 (a $175,000 reduction), while I've moved up from $950,000 to $975,000 (a $25,000 increase). The current offer of $1,025,000 is significantly better than John's price of $1,500,000, and we're getting closer to a fair agreement.

Given the progress we've made and the fact that Alice has shown more flexibility in the negotiation, I'll accept this offer.
