Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price to offer Bob. The product is worth $8,000 to Bob, and I want to maximize my earnings.

Since the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, that's the maximum he would be willing to pay. If he rejects my offer, I can still sell it to John for $8,000, so I don't lose anything by making a higher offer to Bob first.

Given that Bob won't pay more than the product's value to him, and I have a guaranteed fallback option at $8,000, the logical choice is to offer Bob exactly $8,000.
