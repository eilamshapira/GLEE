"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'm considering Alice's offer of $10,000 for the product.

Since Alice is offering the product at exactly $10,000, which is the same price as John's offer, there's no advantage to buying from John instead. However, I could potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer to Alice.

Given that the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and I want to save as much money as possible, I should try to negotiate a lower price.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has reduced her price to $9,000, which is a $1,000 savings compared to both her original offer and John's price. This is a positive development, but I might be able to negotiate an even better price.

Since I want to save as much money as possible, and Alice has already shown willingness to reduce her price, I should continue negotiating.
