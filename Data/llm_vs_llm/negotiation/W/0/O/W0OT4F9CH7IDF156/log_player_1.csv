Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my pricing strategy carefully. I know the product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price if Bob rejects my offer.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I should set a price that's reasonably higher than my $15,000 floor. If I price it too high, Bob might reject it, but I'm still fine because I have John as a backup. If I price it reasonably above my floor, I have a chance to make more profit while still ensuring I don't lose money.
