"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand that the product is unique and of high quality, but the price of $25000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay a reasonable price, but I need to stay within my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $5000.",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I must say that $5000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's exceptional quality and the value it can bring, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $22000. This price is still competitive, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. I'm open to further negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.",22000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your counteroffer of $22000. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still need to stay within my budget. Considering the product's value and our previous discussions, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $8000. This price is more in line with my budget, and I believe it's a fair offer given the product's quality and potential benefits.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $8000. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I still believe the product is worth more than that. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $20000. This price is still competitive, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. I'm open to further negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.",20000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your counteroffer of $20000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm starting to feel that we're not close enough to an agreement. As you know, I have a limited budget, and I need to make a decision that works for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $9000. This is very close to my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that I can buy it from another seller for $10000.",9000.0,Bob,6,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $9000. I appreciate your honesty about your budget and the alternative option you have. However, I still believe the product is worth more than that. Considering your willingness to pay close to $10000 and the value the product can bring, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $18000. This price is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. If we can't come to an agreement, I do have other options available to me. I look forward to hearing your thoughts.",18000.0,Alice,7,
