Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $25,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand that the product is unique and of high quality, but the price of $25000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay a reasonable price, but I need to stay within my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $5000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $5,000 is significantly lower than my initial price and the value I know the product holds, I will reject his offer. I am willing to negotiate, but I need to get closer to a price that reflects the product's true value. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I must say that $5,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's exceptional quality and the value it can bring, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $22,000. This price is still competitive, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. I'm open to further negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your counteroffer of $22000. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still need to stay within my budget. Considering the product's value and our previous discussions, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $8000. This price is more in line with my budget, and I believe it's a fair offer given the product's quality and potential benefits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $8,000 is still significantly lower than my expectations, and I believe the product is worth more than that. While I appreciate his willingness to increase his offer, I'm not ready to settle for a price that undervalues the product. I will make another counteroffer to try to get closer to a price that reflects the product's true value."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $8,000. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your counteroffer of $20000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm starting to feel that we're not close enough to an agreement. As you know, I have a limited budget, and I need to make a decision that works for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $9000. This is very close to my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that I can buy it from another seller for $10000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is higher than his previous offers, it's still lower than what I'm willing to accept. Additionally, his mention of being able to buy the product from another seller for $10,000 suggests that he may be willing to pay more than he's currently offering. I'll make another counteroffer to try to get closer to a price that reflects the product's value. If the negotiations don't progress, I may consider selling to John for $15,000."

However, I still believe the product is worth more than that. Considering your willingness to pay close to $10,000 and the value the product can bring, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $18,000. This price is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. If we can't come to an agreement, I do have other options available to me. I look forward to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
