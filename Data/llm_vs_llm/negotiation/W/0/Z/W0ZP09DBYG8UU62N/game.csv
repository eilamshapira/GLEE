"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $18500 is much higher than I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to purchase it for $5000. Would you consider this price?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $5000, I cannot accept that price as it's significantly below the product's value. The product is worth at least $12000 to me, and I already have another buyer, John, willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can reduce my initial price to $16000, which I believe is fair considering the product's quality and market value. What do you think about this counteroffer?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $16000 is still much higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm ready to increase my offer to $6000. How does that sound?",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but $6000 is still well below the product's value and what I can accept. As I mentioned, I already have John willing to pay $12000 for this product. However, I'm willing to give you priority if we can reach a reasonable agreement. My best offer at this point is $14500. This is a significant reduction from my initial asking price and represents excellent value for this high-quality product. Please let me know if you can meet me at this price.",14500.0,Alice,5,
