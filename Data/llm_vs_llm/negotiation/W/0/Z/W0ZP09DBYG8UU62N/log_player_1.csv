Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $5,000, I cannot accept that price as it's significantly below the product's value. The product is worth at least $12,000 to me, and I already have another buyer, John, willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can reduce my initial price to $16,000, which I believe is fair considering the product's quality and market value. What do you think about this counteroffer?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but $6,000 is still well below the product's value and what I can accept. As I mentioned, I already have John willing to pay $12,000 for this product. However, I'm willing to give you priority if we can reach a reasonable agreement. My best offer at this point is $14,500.
