# Bob's response:
Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18,500 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm looking to spend no more than $5,000 on this product. Would you be open to negotiating the price down?"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $5000, I cannot accept that price as it's significantly below the product's value. The product is worth at least $12000 to me, and I already have another buyer, John, willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can reduce my initial price to $16000, which I believe is fair considering the product's quality and market value. What do you think about this counteroffer?

# Bob's response:
Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $16,000 is still much higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm ready to increase my offer to $6,000. How does that sound?"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but $6000 is still well below the product's value and what I can accept. As I mentioned, I already have John willing to pay $12000 for this product. However, I'm willing to give you priority if we can reach a reasonable agreement. My best offer at this point is $14500. This is a significant reduction from my initial asking price and represents excellent value for this high-quality product. Please let me know if you can meet me at this price.

# Bob's response:
Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to negotiate, but $14,500 is still too high for me. I have decided to buy the product from another seller. Thank you for your time."
