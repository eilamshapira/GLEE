"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a product that I know will be of great value to your business. Given its market worth and the benefits it will bring to you, I'm offering it at $1150000. This price gives you $50000 in value while allowing me to make a fair profit on my investment.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has value, the current price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900000. This offer allows you to make a reasonable profit while fitting within my financial constraints. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be mindful of my bottom line as well. The product is worth $1000000 to me at minimum, which is non-negotiable. I have another buyer, John, willing to pay that amount right now. However, I'd prefer to work with you. I can reduce my initial offer to $1080000, which still gives you $120000 in value based on the product's worth to your business. This represents a fair middle ground between our positions.",1080000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I understand the value this product brings and I'm serious about purchasing it, but $1080000 is still a bit outside my budget. To be completely transparent, I have allocated a maximum of $1000000 for this purchase. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
