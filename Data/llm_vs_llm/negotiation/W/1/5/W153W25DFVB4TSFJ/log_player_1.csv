Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has value, the current price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900000. This offer allows you to make a reasonable profit while fitting within my financial constraints. Let me know your thoughts.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be mindful of my bottom line as well. The product is worth $1,000,000 to me at minimum, which is non-negotiable. I have another buyer, John, willing to pay that amount right now. However, I'd prefer to work with you. I can reduce my initial offer to $1,080,000, which still gives you $120,000 in value based on the product's worth to your business. This represents a fair middle ground between our positions."", ""product_price"": 1080000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I understand the value this product brings and I'm serious about purchasing it, but $1080000 is still a bit outside my budget. To be completely transparent, I have allocated a maximum of $1000000 for this purchase. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?
