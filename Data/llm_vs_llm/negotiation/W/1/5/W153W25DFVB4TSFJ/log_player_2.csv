"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a product that I know will be of great value to your business. Given its market worth and the benefits it will bring to you, I'm offering it at $1150000. This price gives you $50000 in value while allowing me to make a fair profit on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate downwards towards our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has value, the current price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000. This offer allows you to make a reasonable profit while fitting within my financial constraints. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 900000
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be mindful of my bottom line as well. The product is worth $1000000 to me at minimum, which is non-negotiable. I have another buyer, John, willing to pay that amount right now. However, I'd prefer to work with you. I can reduce my initial offer to $1080000, which still gives you $120000 in value based on the product's worth to your business. This represents a fair middle ground between our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has come down in price, it's clear she's using John as leverage. Her claim about another buyer doesn't change the fact that we have time and can still negotiate a better deal.  We'll continue to counter-offer strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I understand the value this product brings and I'm serious about purchasing it, but $1,080,000 is still a bit outside my budget. To be completely transparent, I have allocated a maximum of $1,000,000 for this purchase. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
