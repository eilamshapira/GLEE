"Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Analyzing the situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $3,000,000
2. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $1,000,000

Since Alice's offer ($3,000,000) exceeds the maximum value the product has to me ($1,000,000), and is also higher than John's offer ($1,000,000), the rational choice is to buy from John.
