"Alice, that's a bit high for my budget. I'm interested, but I can only offer $10000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're working with a budget. However, $10000 is lower than I can accept. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $14000.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $11500?  I'm really interested in this product and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your increased offer. I'm willing to come down further, but I'm still not quite at $11500. Let's try $13000. This is a significant reduction and represents a great value for you.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $12500.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's get this deal done.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is your final offer. I am very close to your price. How about we meet at $12750? Just a slight nudge, and we both walk away happy.",12750.0,Alice,7,
