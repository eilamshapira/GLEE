Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll analyze this situation:

1. My minimum acceptable price is $100
2. The product is worth $150 to Bob
3. If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed $100 from John
4. Bob will likely accept any price up to $150

Given this, I should offer a price that's high enough to maximize my profit but low enough that Bob will still accept. Since Bob values the product at $150, offering slightly below that would be optimal, as it still gives him a small surplus while maximizing my profit.
