"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 11,800}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. Bob's offer is below even my minimum acceptable price ($10,000), and it's also lower than John's guaranteed offer. Since we still have several rounds left and Bob has shown interest in negotiating, I'll continue the negotiation with a new counteroffer.

{""product_price"": 11,200}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 11,200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob has moved up to $10,000 (matching John's offer), this shows he's willing to negotiate upward. Given that the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, there's still room for a better deal. I'll continue negotiating with a lower counteroffer than my previous one to show flexibility.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 10,800}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $10,500. This is a reasonable compromise because:
1. It's better than John's guaranteed offer of $10,000
2. We're already in round 6, and continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away
3. Bob has shown steady increases in his offers, but the increments are getting smaller
4. The price gives me a decent profit above my minimum price of $10,000"
