"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given that the product is worth at most $120 to me, Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than my maximum value. Also, John is offering the exact product for $120, which matches my maximum valuation.

The rational decision here is to simply buy from John and save $60 compared to Alice's offer.
