Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above the product's value to Bob, hoping to leave some room for negotiation.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd like to get the most for the product, I'm willing to negotiate further.  Let's see if I can find a price that's more fair to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, but still shows I'm willing to compromise. I'm hopeful that Bob will see this as a fair offer."
