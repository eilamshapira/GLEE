"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $10000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $7000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $8500? I believe this price still offers you a great deal while ensuring I get a fair return.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for countering, Alice. I'm getting closer, but $8500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Could you consider $7750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $7750 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  Let's split the difference - how about $8125?  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",8125.0,Alice,5,

"You drive a hard bargain, Alice! I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $8000? That's a fair compromise.",8000.0,Bob,6,
