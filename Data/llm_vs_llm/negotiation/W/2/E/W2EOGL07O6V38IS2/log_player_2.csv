"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'll analyze this situation strategically. 

Alice is offering me the product for $150. This is the same price that I could get the product from John, and also the maximum value I place on the product. 

Given that:
- The product is worth $80 to Alice, meaning she has room to offer a lower price
- I can potentially get a better deal through negotiation
- There's no risk in making a counteroffer, since I can always fall back to buying from John at $150

It makes sense to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer that would give me some savings while still allowing Alice to make a profit.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has come down from $150 to $130, which shows she's willing to negotiate. While this is better than John's price of $150, I still think there's room for a better deal since the product is only worth $80 to Alice.

I'll reject this offer and try another counteroffer, as I can still buy from John at $150 if the negotiation doesn't go well.
