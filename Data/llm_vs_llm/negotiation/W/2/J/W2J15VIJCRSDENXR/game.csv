"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $140? Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product valuable. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,5,

"Thanks for working with me, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, $120 is still more than I can allocate. I'm willing to increase my offer to $100 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your offer. However, $100 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to go down to $110, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with this purchase. Let's finalize this deal!",110.0,Alice,7,
