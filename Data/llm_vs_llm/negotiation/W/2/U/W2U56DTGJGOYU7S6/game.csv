,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $300 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I believe it's a fair price considering I can also buy it from John for $120.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $100 is lower than what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $250.",250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering I can buy it from John for $120, I'd like to propose a price of $110. It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit. However, $110 is still too low for me. I am going to go down to $225, but that's as low as I can go.",225.0,Alice,5,
