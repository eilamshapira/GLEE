"Bob, I'm excited about the possibility of you acquiring this unique product. Given its immense value, I'm initially offering it to you for $1150000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you and the value I place on it.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm glad we're discussing this opportunity. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point, considering the product's value to both of us. I'd like to propose a price of $1050000.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a more favorable price. However, $1050000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go at this stage. How about we meet in the middle a bit? I'm willing to come down to $1125000. This reflects the value I see in the product and shows my willingness to work with you.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $1125000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering we both want to make a deal, I'd like to propose a price of $1075000. This is a compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see that we are slowly getting closer to a deal. I am willing to come down a bit further. How about $1100000? I think that is a very reasonable price for such a high-value product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. $1100000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'd like to propose a price of $1087500. This is a small step up from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise between our positions.",1087500.0,Bob,6,
