,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, $3000000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $500000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $500000 is much lower than I can accept. Let's meet in the middle at $2250000. This is a great value for the product, and I hope you'll reconsider.",2250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $2250000 is still too high for me. I can go up to $750000. This is my best offer considering my budget constraints. Let's see if we can make this work.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I must insist that the product's value is much higher. Let's settle for $1875000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",1875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $1875000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $900000. This is a substantial increase from my last offer, and I hope it brings us closer to a deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're still quite far apart on the price. Let me make another adjustment and offer it to you for $1500000. This is a significant move from my last offer, and I believe it's a very competitive price for the product.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for adjusting the price further. However, $1500000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is my final offer before considering other options. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,8,
