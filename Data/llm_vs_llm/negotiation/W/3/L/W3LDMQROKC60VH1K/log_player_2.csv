Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm eager to find a suitable agreement, I'm not quite ready to come down to $900000 at this stage. How about we meet in the middle? I'd be willing to sell the product to you for:

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. Since she was willing to come down from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between her last offer and my previous counteroffer.
