"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $10000. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Given that Alice is offering the product for $10,000, which is $5,000 less than John's price of $15,000, and the product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, this is a good deal. I should accept Alice's offer.
