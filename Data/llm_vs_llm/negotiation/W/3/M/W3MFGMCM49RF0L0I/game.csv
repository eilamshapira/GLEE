"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the product's value from your perspective, but my budget is considerably lower. I can offer you $500000 for the product. Let me know if we can work something out within this range.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. While I appreciate your offer, $500000 is significantly lower than the product's value. I'm willing to come down from my initial asking price, so let's meet in the middle at $1750000. This way, we both make some concessions. Looking forward to your response. Best, Alice",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1750000 is still beyond what I can pay. I can increase my offer to $600000. I hope we can find common ground with this offer.",600000.0,Bob,4,
