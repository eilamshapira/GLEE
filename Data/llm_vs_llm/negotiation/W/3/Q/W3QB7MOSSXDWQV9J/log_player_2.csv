"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $200. Would you like to buy it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Reason: The offer from Alice is $200, which is above my budget of $100. I can buy the same product from John for $100, so I will reject Alice's offer and consider buying from John instead."
