"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit out of my budget. Considering current market alternatives, I can only offer $900000 for the product. Letâ€™s see if we can work something out at that price.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $900000 is significantly below the value I'm seeking.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  This is a fair price considering the product's unique benefits and potential.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
