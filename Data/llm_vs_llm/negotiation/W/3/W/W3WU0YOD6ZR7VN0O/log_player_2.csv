"Alice's offer: The product price will be $300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Given that my maximum value for the product is $150 and John is willing to sell it at exactly $150, there's no way I would accept Alice's offer of $300 as it's way above my maximum value. I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If we can't reach an agreement, I can always buy from John at $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 100}

I'll offer $100 for the product. This price is below John's price of $150, giving me some potential savings if Alice accepts. It also leaves room for negotiation if Alice wants to counter, while still being a reasonable starting point. If Alice rejects and counters with a price above $150, I can always fall back on John's offer."
