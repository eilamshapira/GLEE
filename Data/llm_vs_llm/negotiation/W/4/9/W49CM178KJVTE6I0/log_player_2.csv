"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I'm willing to let it go for $12000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $8,000
2. Alice is offering the product for $12,000
3. John is willing to sell it for $8,000

Alice's offer ($12,000) is significantly higher than both:
- My maximum value ($8,000)
- John's alternative offer ($8,000)

It would not be rational to accept Alice's offer since it's $4,000 more than both my maximum value and John's price. The best decision would be to buy from John.
