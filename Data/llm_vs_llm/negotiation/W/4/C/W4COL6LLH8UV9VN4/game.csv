"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2500000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1000000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a different price in mind.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $1000000 is the absolute minimum value this product holds for me. I have another buyer, John, who is already willing to pay that amount. However, I'm offering you the opportunity first because I believe this product could be particularly valuable to you. Given its unique qualities and potential return on investment, I can reduce my asking price to $1800000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. Would you be willing to consider this price point?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price to $1800000. However, that's still above what I'm prepared to spend. Given that John is willing to sell the product for $1500000, I'd like to counter with an offer of $1200000. This is a fair price considering the market and my budget constraints. Let me know if this is something you can work with.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $1200000. I appreciate that you've moved up from your initial position. I notice you mentioned John is willing to sell the product for $1500000, but to clarify - John is actually offering to buy the product from me for $1000000, not sell it. Given this information and the significant value this product holds, I can come down to $1500000, which I believe is fair considering its market value and potential benefits to you. This represents a full $1000000 reduction from my initial offer. Would you be able to meet me at this price point?",1500000.0,Alice,5,
