Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2500000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1000000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a different price in mind.

While I understand budget constraints, $1,000,000 is the absolute minimum value this product holds for me. I have another buyer, John, who is already willing to pay that amount.

Bob's offer:

Given that John is willing to sell the product for $1500000, I'd like to counter with an offer of $1200000. This is a fair price considering the market and my budget constraints.

Given this information and the significant value this product holds, I can come down to $1,500,000, which I believe is fair considering its market value and potential benefits to you.
