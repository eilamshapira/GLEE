Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $1000000 is the absolute minimum value this product holds for me. I have another buyer, John, who is already willing to pay that amount. However, I'm offering you the opportunity first because I believe this product could be particularly valuable to you. Given its unique qualities and potential return on investment, I can reduce my asking price to $1800000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. Would you be willing to consider this price point?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $1200000. I appreciate that you've moved up from your initial position. I notice you mentioned John is willing to sell the product for $1500000, but to clarify - John is actually offering to buy the product from me for $1000000, not sell it. Given this information and the significant value this product holds, I can come down to $1500000, which I believe is fair considering its market value and potential benefits to you. This represents a full $1000000 reduction from my initial offer. Would you be able to meet me at this price point?
