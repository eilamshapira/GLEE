"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to consider my options carefully:

1) Accept Alice's offer for $150
2) Reject Alice's offer
3) Buy from John for $150

Since the product is worth no more than $150 to me, and Alice is offering it at exactly $150, which is the same price John is offering, there's no advantage to buying from one over the other. However, since I'm already in a negotiation with Alice, it makes sense to accept her offer rather than starting a new transaction with John.
