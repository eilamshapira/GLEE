(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's offer of $200 is way above the $80 limit which is the maximum value of the product to me. Since I can buy the same product from John for $80, there's no reason to accept Alice's high offer. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round.

Since I can get the same product from John for $80, there's no reason to accept this high offer. I'll reject and continue negotiating.
