"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $15000. This is a fair price considering the product's specifications and benefits. I'd be happy to discuss this further with you.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $6000 for the product, considering my budget and the current market conditions. I'm interested in the product, but I need a more competitive price to move forward.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I can't accept $6000 as it's significantly below the product's value to me. I understand budget constraints, but this product is worth no less than $10000 to me based on its quality and market value. I can come down to $13000, which is already a substantial discount from my initial offer. Let me know if this works for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $13000. However, this price is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your current offer. I can offer $8500 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your offer of $8500. While we're getting closer, I need to be transparent that I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase the product for $10000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. My absolute minimum is $10000, which matches my alternative option. I can't go lower than this as it would be financially unsound for me. Would you be able to meet me at $10000?",10000.0,Alice,5,
