Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $15,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $6000 for the product, considering my budget and the current market conditions. I'm interested in the product, but I need a more competitive price to move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I can't accept $6,000 as it's significantly below the product's value to me. I understand budget constraints, but this product is worth no less than $10,000 to me based on its quality and market value. I can come down to $13,000, which is already a substantial discount from my initial offer. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your current offer. I can offer $8500 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your offer of $8,500. While we're getting closer, I need to be transparent that I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase the product for $10,000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. My absolute minimum is $10,000, which matches my alternative option. I can't go lower than this as it would be financially unsound for me.
