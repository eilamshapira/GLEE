Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I can't accept $6000 as it's significantly below the product's value to me. I understand budget constraints, but this product is worth no less than $10000 to me based on its quality and market value. I can come down to $13000, which is already a substantial discount from my initial offer. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your offer of $8500. While we're getting closer, I need to be transparent that I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase the product for $10000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. My absolute minimum is $10000, which matches my alternative option. I can't go lower than this as it would be financially unsound for me. Would you be able to meet me at $10000?
