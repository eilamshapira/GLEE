"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, the initial price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering my budget and the product's value to me, I'd like to counter with an offer of $1200000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, thank you for coming down on the price. I'm still looking to maximize my savings. Would you be willing to come down to $1100000? That price would align better with my budget and the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. While $1100000 is lower than I'd like, I also value a smooth and successful transaction. Let's try $1300000. I think that's a very fair compromise considering the value this brings to you.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand this is your final offer, but $1050000 is too low. I truly believe you're underestimating the long-term gains you'll achieve with this product. I'm willing to come down slightly, one last time. My absolute lowest is $1250000. This is also my final offer.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
