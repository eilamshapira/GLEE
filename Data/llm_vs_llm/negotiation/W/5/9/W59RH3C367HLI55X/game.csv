"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $19500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential value to you.",19500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $19500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $10000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you have budget constraints, but $10000 is significantly below the product's value. I cannot go that low as the product's minimum value is $15000. However, I can reduce my initial ask - I'm willing to offer the product for $17500. This is a substantial reduction from my initial price and reflects my desire to work with you.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. While I appreciate your flexibility, $17500 is still above what I can afford. I can increase my offer to $11500. Let me know if we can work something out at this price.",11500.0,Bob,4,
