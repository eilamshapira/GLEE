"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $19,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential value to you."", ""product_price"": 19500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $19500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $10000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $10,000 as it's well below even my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round that's more reasonable, as there's still room for negotiation between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you have budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below the product's value. I cannot go that low as the product's minimum value is $15,000. However, I can reduce my initial ask - I'm willing to offer the product for $17,500. This is a substantial reduction from my initial price and reflects my desire to work with you."", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. While I appreciate your flexibility, $17500 is still above what I can afford. I can increase my offer to $11500. Let me know if we can work something out at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $15,000. Bob's second offer of $11,500 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and given that we've already gone through multiple rounds with Bob only increasing his offer by $1,500, it seems unlikely that we'll reach an agreement at or above $15,000. John's guaranteed offer of $15,000 is the better business decision at this point."
