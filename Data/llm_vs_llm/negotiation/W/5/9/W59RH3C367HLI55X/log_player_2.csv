Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $19500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential value to you.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you have budget constraints, but $10000 is significantly below the product's value. I cannot go that low as the product's minimum value is $15000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
