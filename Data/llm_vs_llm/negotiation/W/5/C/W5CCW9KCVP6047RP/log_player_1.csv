"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for Round 1:

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Considering my options, I'll analyze the situation. I need to make at least $80. Bob's offer is exactly that. However, there are still 8 rounds left. I could potentially get more.

Therefore, I choose to **reject** Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob for Round 3:

{""product_price"": 120}"

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","This is a good offer from Bob. $90 is better than the $80 I'm guaranteed from John. I still have 6 rounds left, so there's some chance I could get more, but the risk is I could end up with less. The longer I wait, the more likely Bob might lower his offer, or I might run out of rounds. 

Therefore, I choose to **accept** Bob's offer.
