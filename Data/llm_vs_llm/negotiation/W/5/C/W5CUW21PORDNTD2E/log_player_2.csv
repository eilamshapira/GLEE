"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm thrilled you're interested in acquiring this unique asset. It represents a truly exceptional opportunity. To begin the conversation, I'm offering it to you for $3000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The offer from Alice at $3,000,000 is significantly higher than both:
1. The maximum value the product is worth to me ($800,000)
2. John's guaranteed selling price ($800,000)

There's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice when her initial offer is almost 4 times higher than what I can get from John. The most rational decision is to buy from John immediately."
