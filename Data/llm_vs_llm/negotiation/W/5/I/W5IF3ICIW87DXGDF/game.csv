"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your initial proposal, I believe there's room for a more mutually beneficial agreement. The market value you mentioned is accurate, but I have another option to purchase at $1000000. I'm willing to offer $850000, which would still provide you with a significant profit margin while giving me more valuable savings. This price point makes it an attractive deal for both of us, as it's considerably below the market price but still provides a healthy return on your investment.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $850000 is too close to my minimum threshold. The product truly is worth $1000000 on the market, and I'm already offering you a significant discount. I can come down to $920000, which gives you an $80000 value advantage - a substantial savings of 8% off the market value. This represents a fair middle ground between our positions while still ensuring the deal remains profitable for both of us.",920000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving down from your initial offer. Your willingness to negotiate shows we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. While $920000 still represents significant savings compared to the market price, I believe we can find a middle ground that works better for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $875000, which is a substantial improvement from my previous offer. This price would give you a healthy profit margin while providing me with meaningful savings. It's a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging both our interests.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your commitment to finding a middle ground. I can see you're serious about this purchase. While $875000 is getting closer, I still need to ensure I'm maximizing the value of this product. Let me meet you closer to the middle - I can offer $900000, which represents a full $100000 discount from the market value. This is a 10% savings for you while still being a fair price for me. This represents my best reasonable offer and shows my willingness to work with you on this deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
