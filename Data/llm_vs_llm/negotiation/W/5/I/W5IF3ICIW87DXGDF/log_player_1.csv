Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your initial proposal, I believe there's room for a more mutually beneficial agreement. The market value you mentioned is accurate, but I have another option to purchase at $1000000. I'm willing to offer $850000, which would still provide you with a significant profit margin while giving me more valuable savings. This price point makes it an attractive deal for both of us, as it's considerably below the market price but still provides a healthy return on your investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

The product truly is worth $1,000,000 on the market, and I'm already offering you a significant discount. I can come down to $920,000, which gives you an $80,000 value advantage - a substantial savings of 8% off the market value. This represents a fair middle ground between our positions while still ensuring the deal remains profitable for both of us."", ""product_price"": 920000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving down from your initial offer. Your willingness to negotiate shows we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. While $920000 still represents significant savings compared to the market price, I believe we can find a middle ground that works better for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $875000, which is a substantial improvement from my previous offer. This price would give you a healthy profit margin while providing me with meaningful savings. It's a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging both our interests.
