,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is quite high for this product. I've done my market research, and I know similar products are available for much less. I can offer $10000, which I believe is a fair price considering the market conditions.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but my initial price reflects the unique qualities and superior performance of this specific product. While I can't go as low as $10000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle a bit. How about $14000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $14000 is still more than I can justify spending. I've received other offers in the market around $11000. I can increase my offer to $11500, which I believe is a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting close to my bottom line. Given the offers you've mentioned, and knowing the value this product brings, I'll come down to $13000. This is a significant drop and my final offer for now.",13000.0,Alice,5,
