"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for a price that's significantly lower than its true value to me.  I understand it's worth $800000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1200000. This is a great deal for both of us. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay full price. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
