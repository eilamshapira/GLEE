"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for a price that's significantly lower than its true value to me.  I understand it's worth $800000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1200000. This is a great deal for both of us. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay full price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
