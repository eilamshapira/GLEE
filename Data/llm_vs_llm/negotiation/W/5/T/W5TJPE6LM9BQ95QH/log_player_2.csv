"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offered price of $150 is higher than both my maximum valuation ($100) and John's price ($100). It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer, as I can always fall back to buying from John for $100 if negotiations with Alice don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 80}

I'm offering $80, which is below John's price of $100. This gives room for negotiation while potentially saving money compared to buying from John. If Alice rejects this offer, we can still negotiate, or I can ultimately buy from John at $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $130 is still higher than both my maximum valuation ($100) and John's price ($100). I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer. There's still no risk in continuing to negotiate since I can always buy from John for $100 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 90}

I'm offering $90, which is a $10 increase from my previous offer of $80. This shows I'm willing to negotiate upward while still staying below John's price of $100. This gives Alice room to make a profit while potentially saving me money compared to buying from John. If Alice rejects this offer, I can either continue negotiating or fall back to John's $100 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice is still offering a price ($120) that's above John's price ($100) and my maximum valuation ($100), and she hasn't shown much willingness to come down to a competitive price after several rounds of negotiation, it's best to take John's guaranteed offer of $100. This ensures I get the product at a price that matches my maximum valuation without further delay or uncertainty."
