"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Given that Alice is offering the product for $14,000, which is less than John's price of $15,000, I should try to negotiate for an even better price. Since we have 10 rounds to negotiate and there's no penalty for continuing the negotiation, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her cost of $8,000. This gives us room to negotiate toward a fair middle ground.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has come down $1,000 from her initial offer, which shows she's willing to negotiate. Since she rejected my $10,000 offer but reduced her price, I'll continue negotiating as we still have plenty of rounds left and I can still get a better price than both her current offer and John's price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down by $1,000 (from $14,000 to $13,000), I'll increase my offer by a similar amount to show good faith in the negotiation while still trying to get a good price.

{""product_price"": $11,000}"

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her price again by $1,000, now offering $12,000. This is good progress in our negotiation. We're moving closer to a middle ground between her original $14,000 and my $10,000. I still have several rounds left to negotiate, so I'll continue trying to get an even better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has been reducing her price by $1,000 each round, and I've been increasing mine by $1,000. To maintain this pattern and continue moving toward a middle ground, I'll increase my offer again.

{""product_price"": $11,500}"

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has now reduced her price to $11,750, which is getting much closer to what I've been offering. She reduced her price by only $250 this time, indicating we're getting closer to her bottom line. This is a reasonable price - significantly better than John's $15,000 and getting close to a fair middle ground between her cost ($8,000) and my maximum ($15,000). Since we're making smaller incremental changes now and we're in Round 7 of 10, I'll accept this offer.
