"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, I can actually get the same product from John for $12000 as well. I'd like to purchase from you instead, but I'm looking for a better deal. Would you be willing to sell it for $9500? This would make it worth my while to buy from you rather than from John.",9500.0,Bob,2,,
