Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for a price of $12,000."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, I can actually get the same product from John for $12000 as well. I'd like to purchase from you instead, but I'm looking for a better deal. Would you be willing to sell it for $9500? This would make it worth my while to buy from you rather than from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Okay, considering Bob's counteroffer and my minimum acceptable price, I need to make a strategic decision. $9,500 is more than my minimum of $8,000, but I want to maximize my profit. Bob also mentioned he can get the product from John for $12,000, which could indicate he values it higher.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counter_offer_price"": 10500}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,500."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
