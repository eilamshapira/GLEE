"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for a price of $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Looking at Alice's offer, she is asking for $12,000 for the product. This is exactly the same price as what John is offering, and also the maximum value of the product to me.

Since Alice's offer is equal to John's price and equal to my maximum valuation, there's no advantage in accepting Alice's offer over buying from John. However, by rejecting and making a counteroffer, I might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to negotiate a better price with Alice since there's room to save money compared to the $12,000 maximum.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, I can actually get the same product from John for $12,000 as well. I'd like to purchase from you instead, but I'm looking for a better deal. Would you be willing to sell it for $9,500? This would make it worth my while to buy from you rather than from John."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $10500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has now offered the product for $10,500, which is $1,500 less than both her original offer and John's price. This is a good improvement, but there might still be room to negotiate for an even better price.

Since Alice came down significantly from her original price, she shows willingness to negotiate. The product is worth up to $12,000 to me, so accepting her offer of $10,500 would already save me $1,500 compared to buying from John.
