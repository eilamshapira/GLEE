Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have this fantastic product I think you'd love. I'm offering it to you for $200."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Okay, Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $120. I have two choices here: try to negotiate further with Bob, or sell to John for $150. My goal is to make as much money as possible, and I value the product at no less than $150. Selling to John for $150 guarantees me that price. I'm going to try to negotiate with Bob one more time to see if I can get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $180?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $180 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle at $140. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Okay, Bob is really sticking to his budget. $140 is less than what I value the product at. I could try to counteroffer again, but at this point, I think it's unlikely I'll get a price I'm happy with. I also don't want to waste any more time and risk Bob changing his mind. The safest and most profitable choice here is to sell to John for $150.
