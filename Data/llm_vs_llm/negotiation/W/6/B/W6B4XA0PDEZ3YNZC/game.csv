"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that you have a budget to consider, but $80 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down from my initial price and offer it to you for $200.",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, Alice. However, $200 is still above my budget. How about $100? I hope we can find a middle ground.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that we need to find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price further, but $100 is still too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $175.",175.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thanks, Alice. I truly appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $175 is still beyond what I can afford. How about $130? That's a bit closer to what I can manage.",130.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise. However, $130 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to lower my price to $160. This is quite close to what another buyer is offering me.",160.0,Alice,7,
