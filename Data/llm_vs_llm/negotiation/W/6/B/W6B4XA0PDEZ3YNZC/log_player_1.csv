"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe you might be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250."", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit over my budget. I would be willing to consider purchasing the product for $80. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

# Explanation:
Offer of $80 from Bob is quite low compared to the value of the product to me and the offer from John. Therefore, I will reject this offer and try to negotiate further with Bob to get a better price. If I can't reach a satisfactory price, I have the option to sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that you have a budget to consider, but $80 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down from my initial price and offer it to you for $200."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, Alice. However, $200 is still above my budget. How about $100? I hope we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

# Explanation:
Bob's new offer of $100 is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept, given that I can sell the product to John for $150. I will continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more acceptable price. If not, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand that we need to find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price further, but $100 is still too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $175."", ""product_price"": 175}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks, Alice. I truly appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $175 is still beyond what I can afford. How about $130? That's a bit closer to what I can manage. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Though Bob is raising his offer, it's still below the amount I can get from John. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if Bob can match or exceed John's offer. If not, I'll consider selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise. However, $130 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to lower my price to $160. This is quite close to what another buyer is offering me."", ""product_price"": 160}"
