"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'm offering for sale. Based on its features and market value, I'm pricing it at $25000. This is a competitive price for the value you'll receive. Are you interested in purchasing at this price?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $25000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $8000 at this time.  This is my best offer, let me know if you're willing to work with me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest. I understand budget constraints, but $8000 is significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. The product has features and quality that justify a higher price point. I can come down to $22000, which is already a substantial discount from my initial offer. This product represents a great value even at this price. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $22000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $12000, but that's my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to come down that far, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but $12000 is still below what I can accept for this product. Given its quality and market value, my minimum acceptable price is $18000. This is already a significant reduction from my initial price of $25000. I believe this represents a fair compromise between us. Would you be willing to meet me at this price point?",18000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm really interested in this product, but $18000 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15000, but I can't go any higher. Let's meet in the middle.",15000.0,Bob,6,
