Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest. I understand budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. The product has features and quality that justify a higher price point.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
