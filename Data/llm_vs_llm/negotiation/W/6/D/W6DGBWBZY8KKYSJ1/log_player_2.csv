"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'm offering for sale. Based on its features and market value, I'm pricing it at $25000. This is a competitive price for the value you'll receive. Are you interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way too high.  I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $25,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $8,000 at this time.  This is my best offer, let me know if you're willing to work with me."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest. I understand budget constraints, but $8000 is significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. The product has features and quality that justify a higher price point. I can come down to $22000, which is already a substantial discount from my initial offer. This product represents a great value even at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$22,000 is still too high. I'm going to try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product has value, but $22,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but that's my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to come down that far, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but $12000 is still below what I can accept for this product. Given its quality and market value, my minimum acceptable price is $18000. This is already a significant reduction from my initial price of $25000. I believe this represents a fair compromise between us. Would you be willing to meet me at this price point? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $18,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable going that high. I'm going to try to negotiate one more time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm really interested in this product, but $18,000 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,000, but I can't go any higher. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 15000}
