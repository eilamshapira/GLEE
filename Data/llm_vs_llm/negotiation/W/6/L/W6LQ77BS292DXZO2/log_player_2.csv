"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. If you're interested, please consider my offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to evaluate Alice's offer compared to my alternative option.

Alice is offering the product for $200, but the product is only worth up to $80 to me. John is willing to sell me the same product for $80, which is the maximum I value it at.

Since Alice's price of $200 far exceeds both my valuation and my alternative option, it makes no sense for me to accept her offer.
