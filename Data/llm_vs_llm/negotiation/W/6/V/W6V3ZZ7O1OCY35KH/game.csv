"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe this price reflects a fair market value considering the product's features and performance.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600000 is significantly below the market value and my minimum acceptable price. This product has proven performance and features that justify a higher price point. I understand you're looking for a good deal, so I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This is still a competitive price considering the product's value and potential return on investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you, Alice, for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1050000 is still a bit out of my budget. Considering the product's value and our discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $750000. I believe this price is more reflective of the product's worth to me and demonstrates my serious interest in purchasing it.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your improved offer of $750000. While we're moving in the right direction, that price is still below what I can accept, especially considering I have a guaranteed offer of $800000 from another buyer. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. My counteroffer is $950000, which represents a significant reduction from my initial asking price and reflects my sincere desire to close this deal with you.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your latest offer and for sharing the information about the other buyer. I understand your position and appreciate your preference to do business with me. Considering the product's value and the other offer you've mentioned, I'm willing to increase my offer to $850000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious commitment to purchasing the product from you.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer of $850000, which shows your serious interest in the product. We're getting closer, but I still believe the product's true value is higher. Given our productive negotiation so far, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle at $900000. This is my final counteroffer and represents a $300000 reduction from my initial price. At this price point, you'd be getting excellent value for a product that will serve your needs well and provide strong returns.",900000.0,Alice,7,
