"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is quite high for me. I can get a similar product from another seller for $80. I'd like to offer $60 for your product, which I believe is a fair price.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me. Considering the quality and value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be transparent - I have a firm alternative offer of $80 from another seller. I can offer you $70, which would still be better for me than my alternative option. Would you consider this price?",70.0,Bob,4,
