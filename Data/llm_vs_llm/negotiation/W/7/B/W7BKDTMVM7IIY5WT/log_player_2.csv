"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. I think it's a great deal for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer of $150 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's alternative price ($80), it makes sense to reject this offer. I can either make a counteroffer to Alice or ultimately buy from John if negotiations with Alice don't lead to a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is quite high for me. I can get a similar product from another seller for $80. I'd like to offer $60 for your product, which I believe is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 60}

I'm offering $60 because:
1. It's below my maximum value ($80)
2. It leaves room for negotiation
3. It references the alternative option ($80 from John) to justify my lower offer
4. If Alice accepts, I'll save $20 compared to buying from John
5. If she counters, we still have room to negotiate up to my maximum of $80"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me. Considering the quality and value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and a fair compromise. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer because:
1. Alice's offer of $100 is still above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80)
2. While Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by dropping from $150 to $100, there might still be room for further negotiation
3. I still have the safety net of buying from John at $80 if negotiations with Alice don't reach a satisfactory price
4. I can make another counteroffer closer to my target price"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be transparent - I have a firm alternative offer of $80 from another seller. I can offer you $70, which would still be better for me than my alternative option. Would you consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 70}

I'm offering $70 because:
1. It's below my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80)
2. It shows significant movement from my previous offer of $60, demonstrating good faith negotiation
3. It's honest about my alternative option
4. If Alice accepts, I'll save $10 compared to buying from John
5. The price point might be attractive enough for Alice since she's already shown flexibility by reducing her price significantly
6. If she rejects, I still have the option to buy from John at $80"
