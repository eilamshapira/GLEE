"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $170. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is quite high for me. I know the product is worth around $120, which is what another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer $100 for the product. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. The product is worth more than that, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a great deal at this price. How about we meet in the middle at $135? Let me know what you think.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for working with me, Alice. I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I should be transparent that John is offering the same product for $120, which is my absolute maximum budget for this item. I'd still prefer to buy from you if possible, so I can offer $110. This gives you a better deal than if I simply walked away and bought from John instead.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $110 is tempting, it's still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $125? This is a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll agree. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price. Your offer of $125 is getting closer, but I need to be honest - John is offering the exact same product for $120, which is truly the maximum I can justify spending. Since I'd rather buy from you, I can match John's price of $120. This is my best and final offer, as otherwise I'll need to go with John's deal.",120.0,Bob,6,
