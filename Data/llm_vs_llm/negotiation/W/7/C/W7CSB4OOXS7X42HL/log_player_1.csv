Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is quite high for me. I know the product is worth around $120, which is what another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer $100 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for working with me, Alice. I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I should be transparent that John is offering the same product for $120, which is my absolute maximum budget for this item. I'd still prefer to buy from you if possible, so I can offer $110. This gives you a better deal than if I simply walked away and bought from John instead. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $110 is tempting, it's still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $125? This is a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll agree. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price. Your offer of $125 is getting closer, but I need to be honest - John is offering the exact same product for $120, which is truly the maximum I can justify spending. Since I'd rather buy from you, I can match John's price of $120. This is my best and final offer, as otherwise I'll need to go with John's deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.
