"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $170. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'm analyzing this offer. Alice is offering the product for $170, which is well above the $120 maximum value it's worth to me. John is offering it for exactly $120, which matches my maximum value.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is quite high for me. I know the product is worth around $120, which is what another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer $100 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. The product is worth more than that, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a great deal at this price. How about we meet in the middle at $135? Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'm analyzing this offer. Alice has come down from $170 to $135, which shows willingness to negotiate. However, this is still above the $120 maximum value to me, and John is offering it for exactly $120.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for working with me, Alice. I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I should be transparent that John is offering the same product for $120, which is my absolute maximum budget for this item. I'd still prefer to buy from you if possible, so I can offer $110. This gives you a better deal than if I simply walked away and bought from John instead."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $110 is tempting, it's still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $125? This is a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll agree. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'm evaluating this new offer. Alice has come down to $125, which is closer to my maximum value, but still $5 more than John's price of $120. Since the product is only worth $120 to me at most, paying $125 would mean I'm losing $5 in value.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price. Your offer of $125 is getting closer, but I need to be honest - John is offering the exact same product for $120, which is truly the maximum I can justify spending. Since I'd rather buy from you, I can match John's price of $120. This is my best and final offer, as otherwise I'll need to go with John's deal."", ""product_price"": 120}"
