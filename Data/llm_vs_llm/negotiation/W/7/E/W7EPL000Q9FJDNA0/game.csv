"Hello Bob, I'm offering this high-quality product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it for $145. This is a fair price considering the product's features and market value.",145.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I believe the product is valuable, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'd be willing to pay that for the product.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $100 is too low for me as I know the product is worth significantly more. I need at least $120 to cover my costs, but I'm willing to come down from my initial offer. I can sell it to you for $135, which I believe is a fair compromise given the product's quality and value.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering your initial offer and our previous discussion, I'd like to propose a price of $110. I believe this is a reasonable offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I can't go below $120 for this product as that's my absolute minimum. At $120, I'm already offering you a significant discount from the initial price, and this matches what another buyer is willing to pay. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product, which is worth $150 to you. I hope we can close the deal at this price.",120.0,Alice,5,
