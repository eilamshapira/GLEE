Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $100 is too low for me as I know the product is worth significantly more.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I can't go below $120 for this product as that's my absolute minimum. At $120, I'm already offering you a significant discount from the initial price, and this matches what another buyer is willing to pay. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product, which is worth $150 to you. I hope we can close the deal at this price.
