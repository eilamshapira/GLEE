"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique features and benefits, I'm starting the bidding at $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $20000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $12000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $12000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you be willing to offer a more competitive price, perhaps around $9000? This would give me a reason to choose you over the alternative.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $9000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth a worthwhile investment. How about we meet in the middle at $14500?",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate you working with me. However, $14500 is still above what makes sense for me financially. As I mentioned, I have an alternative offer from John at $12000, and that's really the absolute maximum I can spend on this product. To make it worth choosing you over the alternative, I would need a better price. Would you consider $10500? That would give me a clear reason to purchase from you instead.",10500.0,Bob,4,
