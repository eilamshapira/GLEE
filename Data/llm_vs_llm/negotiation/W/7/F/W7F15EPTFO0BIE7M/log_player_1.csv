Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique features and benefits, I'm starting the bidding at $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $20000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $12000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $12000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you be willing to offer a more competitive price, perhaps around $9000? This would give me a reason to choose you over the alternative. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth a worthwhile investment. How about we meet in the middle at $14,500?"", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate you working with me. However, $14500 is still above what makes sense for me financially. As I mentioned, I have an alternative offer from John at $12000, and that's really the absolute maximum I can spend on this product. To make it worth choosing you over the alternative, I would need a better price. Would you consider $10500? That would give me a clear reason to purchase from you instead. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
