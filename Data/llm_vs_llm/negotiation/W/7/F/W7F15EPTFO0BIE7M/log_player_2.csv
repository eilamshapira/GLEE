"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique features and benefits, I'm starting the bidding at $20000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than the value of the product to me (which is at most $12,000) and also higher than John's price of $12,000. Since I can buy the product from John for $12,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at $20,000.

In this case, I should either reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, or simply buy from John. Since I can always fall back to John's offer later if negotiations with Alice don't work out, it makes sense to try negotiating with Alice first.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $20,000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $12,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you be willing to offer a more competitive price, perhaps around $9,000? This would give me a reason to choose you over the alternative."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $9000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth a worthwhile investment. How about we meet in the middle at $14500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $14,500 is still higher than both my maximum value for the product ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000). It doesn't make financial sense to accept this offer when I can get the same product for less from John.

Since Alice has moved significantly from her initial offer ($20,000 down to $14,500), it suggests she may be willing to negotiate further. I should reject this offer and make another counteroffer before considering buying from John.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate you working with me. However, $14,500 is still above what makes sense for me financially. As I mentioned, I have an alternative offer from John at $12,000, and that's really the absolute maximum I can spend on this product. To make it worth choosing you over the alternative, I would need a better price. Would you consider $10,500? That would give me a clear reason to purchase from you instead."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
