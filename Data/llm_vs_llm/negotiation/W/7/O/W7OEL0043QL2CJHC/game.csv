"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $800000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I can't go as low as $800000. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $1100000. Let me know if that works for you!",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1100000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a little ways off. Could you do $950000? I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, I can’t go down to $950000. How about we settle at $1050000? I believe that’s a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",1050000.0,Alice,5,
