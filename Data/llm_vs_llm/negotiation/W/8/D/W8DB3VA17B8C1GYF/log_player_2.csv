You have three options:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $90?"",

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much room there is for negotiation.  It's a common tactic to start low and work your way up."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counter, Bob. $90 is a bit too low for me, considering the product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $107? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

I'll try to push Alice a little further down. While $107 is better, it's still a ways from my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $90 is quite a jump. How about we split the difference between your offer and mine, say $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

I'm offering a price that's a fair compromise and also happens to be Alice's value for the product. This gives her a chance to make a small profit while still saving me some money."
