"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. I believe it will be a valuable asset for you. My initial offer is $25000. Let me know what you think.",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I'm afraid $25000 is well beyond what I'm looking to spend. The product is worth no more than $10000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell it for exactly that amount. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. Would you consider $8000 for the product?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While $8000 is lower than I'm willing to go, I appreciate you wanting to work with me. Given your willingness to negotiate, I'll meet you in the middle a bit. How about $22000?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing the price down, but $22000 is still much higher than what makes economic sense for me. As I mentioned, the product is only worth $10000 to me, and I have a guaranteed option to purchase it for that price from another seller. To be completely transparent, I'd like to do business with you, but I can't justify paying more than $9000 for something I can get elsewhere for $10000. This would give you a quick sale, and I'd still save a bit compared to my alternative.",9000.0,Bob,4,
