Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. I believe it will be a valuable asset for you. My initial offer is $25,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 25000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I'm afraid $25000 is well beyond what I'm looking to spend. The product is worth no more than $10000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell it for exactly that amount. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. Would you consider $8000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While $8,000 is lower than I'm willing to go, I appreciate you wanting to work with me. Given your willingness to negotiate, I'll meet you in the middle a bit. How about $22,000?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing the price down, but $22000 is still much higher than what makes economic sense for me. As I mentioned, the product is only worth $10000 to me, and I have a guaranteed option to purchase it for that price from another seller. To be completely transparent, I'd like to do business with you, but I can't justify paying more than $9000 for something I can get elsewhere for $10000. This would give you a quick sale, and I'd still save a bit compared to my alternative. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
