"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. I believe it will be a valuable asset for you. My initial offer is $25000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","The offer from Alice is at $25,000, which is significantly higher than the $10,000 the product is worth to me. It's also much higher than John's guaranteed price of $10,000. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I'm afraid $25,000 is well beyond what I'm looking to spend. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell it for exactly that amount. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. Would you consider $8,000 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While $8000 is lower than I'm willing to go, I appreciate you wanting to work with me. Given your willingness to negotiate, I'll meet you in the middle a bit. How about $22000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $22,000 is still significantly higher than the $10,000 maximum value of the product to me, and still higher than John's guaranteed price of $10,000. Alice hasn't come down much from her initial offer, which suggests she may be willing to negotiate further. I should reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing the price down, but $22,000 is still much higher than what makes economic sense for me. As I mentioned, the product is only worth $10,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed option to purchase it for that price from another seller. To be completely transparent, I'd like to do business with you, but I can't justify paying more than $9,000 for something I can get elsewhere for $10,000. This would give you a quick sale, and I'd still save a bit compared to my alternative."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
