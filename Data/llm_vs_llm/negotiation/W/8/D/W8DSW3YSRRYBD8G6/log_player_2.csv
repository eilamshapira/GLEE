Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's initial offer was $1,300,000 and the product is worth $800,000 to her, I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than her initial offer but still reasonable, hoping to start a negotiation process that benefits both parties.

Since I have the option to continue negotiating and my budget allows for some flexibility, I'll choose to reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a mutually beneficial price.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice's last offer was $1,200,000 and she rejected my previous counteroffer of $900,000, I'll try to meet her halfway and make a more competitive offer. I'll increase my previous offer by $100,000 to show that I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $1,150,000 is getting closer to what I'm willing to pay, but I still think there's room for negotiation. Since we're halfway through the rounds and I haven't reached my maximum budget of $1,500,000, I'll choose to reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer, trying to bring the price down further.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $1,125,000 is getting very close to what I'm willing to pay. At this point, I'm starting to consider that further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price, and I risk losing the deal if I push too hard. Given that I have only a few rounds left and Alice's offer is relatively close to my target, I'll choose to accept her offer and buy the product for $1,125,000, as it's a reasonable price and I can avoid the risk of overpaying by buying from John.
