"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $95. Given its quality and utility, this is a fair price. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with the purchase.",95.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for your offer, Alice, but $95 is a bit too high for me. How about $70 for the product?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I can't go as low as $70 as the product is worth at least $80 to me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $87. This is still a good deal considering the product's value and quality.",87.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I still can't go up to $87. How about $75 for the product?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is still below what I can accept. The product is worth at least $80 to me, which is actually what another buyer, John, is willing to pay right now. However, I'd prefer to sell it to you if possible. My final offer is $82 - just slightly above my minimum threshold. This is really the best I can do.",82.0,Alice,5,
