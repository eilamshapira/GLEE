"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","In this case, Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000, which is exactly the same price that John is offering and exactly the maximum amount I'm willing to pay for the product.

Since both options cost the same amount ($1,500,000), and my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, there is no financial advantage to choosing one seller over the other.

Given that there's no price difference, I might as well accept Alice's current offer rather than going through the trouble of finding another seller.
