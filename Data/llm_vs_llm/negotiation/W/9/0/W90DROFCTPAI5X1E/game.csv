"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a lower price.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $60 is significantly below what I can accept for this item. The product costs me $120, so I cannot go below that price. However, I can reduce my initial offer to $135 if that helps make it more affordable for you.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value and my budget, I'd like to propose a price of $70. I believe this is a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",70.0,Bob,4,
