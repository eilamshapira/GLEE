Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value and quality of your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. Considering my budget and other available options, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $600000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000.
