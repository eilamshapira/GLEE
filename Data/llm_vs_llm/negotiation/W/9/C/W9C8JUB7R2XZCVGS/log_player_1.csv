Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll carefully consider my offer to Bob. I'll need to balance the risk of Bob rejecting a high price (in which case I'll get $150 from John) against the potential to earn more than $150.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I should set a price that gives me a reasonable chance of making more than my guaranteed $150 while not being so high that Bob will likely reject it.
