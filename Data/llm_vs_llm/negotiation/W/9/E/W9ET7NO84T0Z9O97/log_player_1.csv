Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum.  I know the product is worth more to me, and I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter with a lower price, but I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I will reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $12,000, which is still above my minimum. I'm hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to get a better price, I think Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'm going to sell the product to him and avoid any further haggling."
