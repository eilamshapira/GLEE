"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I understand your budgetary constraints, my minimum value for the product is $1000000. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1350000? This represents a substantial discount and reflects my willingness to work with you. I believe this is a fair price that still provides significant value to you.

"Bob, thank you for your continued interest. $1100000 is getting closer to what I'm looking for, and I appreciate you meeting me closer to my asking price.
