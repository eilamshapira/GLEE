"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a fantastic product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $120
2. Alice is offering the product for $150
3. John is willing to sell it for $120

Since Alice's offer ($150) is above my maximum value ($120), and John offers exactly what I value the product at, it makes the most sense to buy from John.
