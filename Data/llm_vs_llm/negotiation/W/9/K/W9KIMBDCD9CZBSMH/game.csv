,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $145 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, let's try to close this deal. I can come down a little more, but $135 is really as low as I can go. It's a great product, and I think you'll be very happy with it. If $135 does not work, what is the highest price you are willing to offer?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $135 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I am willing to negotiate a bit more. How about $125?",125.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point, but $125 is still a bit high.  Let's split the difference and go with $120.  This is my final offer.",120.0,Bob,6,
