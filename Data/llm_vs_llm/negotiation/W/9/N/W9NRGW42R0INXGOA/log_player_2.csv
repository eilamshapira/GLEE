"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this exclusive product. Considering its unique value, I'm willing to let it go to you for a price of $1600000. This is below the value I know it has, but I believe it's a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth $1,000,000 to me (maximum I value it)
2. Alice is offering it for $1,600,000
3. John is offering it for $1,000,000

Alice's offer ($1,600,000) is:
- Above my maximum valuation ($1,000,000)
- Much higher than John's alternative offer ($1,000,000)

Since I can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, which matches my maximum valuation and is $600,000 less than Alice's offer, the logical choice is to buy from John.
