"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $175 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $135? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I see where you're coming from, but I need to maintain a minimum price. I can lower it to $160, which is the best I can do. Let me know if you can meet me at this price!",160.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. I can go down to $160, which is really the lowest I can offer while still valuing the product appropriately. Let me know if this works for you!",160.0,Alice,5,
