"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a fantastic product available, and I'd like to offer it to you for $20000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
Explanation: Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than John's price of $15,000 and exceeds my maximum value of $15,000. It makes no economic sense to accept Alice's offer when I can get the same product from John for $5,000 less. Therefore, the best decision is to buy from John."
