You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Given the current offer of $1,000,000 from Alice, and the availability to purchase the same product from John for the same price, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer immediately. Rejecting the offer allows for the possibility of negotiating a lower price.
