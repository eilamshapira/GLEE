Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you coming in below my maximum budget, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. The product is certainly valuable, but I'm looking at a price point closer to $750000. This would still provide you with a substantial amount while allowing me some room in my budget for implementation and other related costs. What do you think about this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This product is exceptional, and its value to you is clearly significant.  Let's compromise. I'm prepared to drop to $850,000.  This price still allows you to realize significant value, and it gives me a fair return on my investment. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your offer of $850000 is getting closer to what I had in mind. However, I'm still hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle of our positions. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800000, which I believe is a fair compromise between your $850000 and my previous $750000. This represents a substantial amount for you while still allowing me to stay comfortably within my budget constraints. Would you find this acceptable?
