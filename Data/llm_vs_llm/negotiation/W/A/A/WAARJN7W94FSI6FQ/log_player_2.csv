"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product.  It's valued at over a million dollars to me, and I believe it will be just as valuable to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $950000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly unique and valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I should analyze this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $950,000, which is $50,000 less than the maximum I'm willing to pay ($1,000,000) and also $50,000 less than John's fixed price.

While this is below my maximum, I believe I can negotiate for a better price since this is only the first round of negotiation and we have up to 10 rounds. By making a counteroffer, I might be able to save more money.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you coming in below my maximum budget, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. The product is certainly valuable, but I'm looking at a price point closer to $750,000. This would still provide you with a substantial amount while allowing me some room in my budget for implementation and other related costs. What do you think about this price?"", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $750000 is simply too low for me.  This product is exceptional, and its value to you is clearly significant.  Let's compromise. I'm prepared to drop to $850000.  This price still allows you to realize significant value, and it gives me a fair return on my investment. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has dropped her price to $850,000, which is now $150,000 below my maximum budget and John's fixed price. This is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $950,000.

While I could continue negotiating to try to get an even better price, Alice has already made a substantial concession by dropping $100,000 from her initial offer. We still have several rounds available, so I could try one more counteroffer to see if I can save even more money.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your offer of $850,000 is getting closer to what I had in mind. However, I'm still hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle of our positions. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000, which I believe is a fair compromise between your $850,000 and my previous $750,000. This represents a substantial amount for you while still allowing me to stay comfortably within my budget constraints. Would you find this acceptable?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
