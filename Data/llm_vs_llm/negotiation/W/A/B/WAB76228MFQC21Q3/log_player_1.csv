Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about the optimal price...

Bob values the product at $150, so he won't pay more than that. If he rejects, I can still sell to John for $120. I should price it high enough to maximize my profit but not so high that Bob will definitely reject it.

I'll offer it at $145, which gives Bob a small $5 benefit while maximizing my profit. If he rejects, I still have John's $120 offer as backup.
