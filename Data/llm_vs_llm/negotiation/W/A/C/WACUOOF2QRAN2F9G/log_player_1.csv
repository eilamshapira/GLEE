Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth at least $120 to me (my minimum acceptable price)
2. The product is worth $80 to Bob
3. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $120

Given that Bob values the product at $80, he won't accept any offer above that amount. Since my minimum acceptable price is $120, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, there's no point in negotiating with Bob. Any deal with Bob would result in less money than selling to John.

I'll make a high initial offer to Bob, knowing he'll reject it, and then I can move on to sell to John.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Let me analyze Bob's offer:

1. Bob is offering $60, which is:
   - Well below my minimum acceptable price ($120)
   - Even below his own valuation ($80)
2. I have a guaranteed offer from John at $120

This is an easy decision. Bob's offer of $60 is far too low and would result in a significant loss compared to my alternative option. Since:
- Bob values the product at only $80, he will never offer more than that
- My minimum acceptable price is $120
- John is willing to pay $120

There's no point in continuing negotiations with Bob as we'll never reach a mutually beneficial agreement. The best course of action is to sell to John immediately.
