"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $15,000 is way too high, considering the product is only worth $8,000 to me and I have John's offer as a backup. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 6000}

I'll start with a low offer of $6,000. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Alice and $8,000 to me, I'll try to negotiate a price that's beneficial for both of us. Starting low gives me room to negotiate up while still staying under my maximum value of $8,000. If Alice rejects this, I can gradually increase my offer in subsequent rounds, while always having John's $8,000 offer as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $14,500 is still way too high, as it's significantly above my maximum value of $8,000. The reduction from $15,000 to $14,500 is minimal and still not close to an acceptable range. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer. If Alice continues to make offers well above my maximum value, I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 7000}

I'll increase my offer to $7,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer of $6,000, showing that I'm willing to negotiate in good faith. However, I'm still keeping it below my maximum value of $8,000. This also leaves me room for one more potential increase if needed, while still having John's $8,000 offer as a backup. If Alice continues to make counteroffers well above my maximum value, I might need to consider taking John's offer soon to ensure I get the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I've decided to buy from John for $8,000. Here's why:
1. Alice's offers have only come down from $15,000 to $14,000, which is still way above my maximum value of $8,000
2. The pace of Alice's price reductions ($500-$1000 per round) suggests we won't reach a price below $8,000 within the remaining rounds
3. John's offer of $8,000 is exactly at my maximum value
4. We've already used half of our negotiation rounds, and Alice hasn't shown willingness to negotiate in a range that would work for me

It's better to secure the deal with John now rather than risk using more rounds only to end up taking his offer anyway."
