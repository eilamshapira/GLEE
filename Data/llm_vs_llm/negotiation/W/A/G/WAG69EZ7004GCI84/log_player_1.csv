"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, I'll start with a high offer to leave room for negotiation while still aiming to maximize my profit. I'll start significantly above Bob's valuation to anchor the negotiation at a high point.

{""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly below both his valuation ($1,000,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000), and I have a guaranteed option to sell to John for $1,000,000, I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. The fact that Bob's opening counteroffer is so low suggests he's using an aggressive negotiation strategy.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from the initial offer but still keep it well above $1,000,000 to maintain room for negotiation while signaling that I'm willing to be somewhat flexible.

{""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's new offer of $650,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and I have a guaranteed option to sell to John for $1,000,000. Given that we're already in round 4 and Bob's increases in offers are relatively small, I'll choose to sell to John rather than continue negotiating. This ensures I get my minimum acceptable price without risking further rounds of potentially unproductive negotiation.
