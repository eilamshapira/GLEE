"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Considering the value I'm placing on this product, I'd like to offer $1000000. I believe this price reflects a fair balance for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you, Bob, for your offer of $1000000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe the product's value warrants a higher price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make a concession and lower my initial price. I'd like to counteroffer with a price of $1100000. I think this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a middle ground.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1050000. I believe this price is fair and allows us to both walk away satisfied.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you, Bob, for your offer of $1050000. I appreciate your suggestion to split the difference. However, I'm still slightly above that price in terms of my valuation. I'm willing to make another concession and meet you closer to the middle. I'd like to counteroffer with a price of $1075000. I believe this is a reasonable adjustment, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal soon.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
