Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an initial offer to Bob, but I need to be strategic here. My product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and I know I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at exactly that price. Bob values the product at only $12,000, which means any deal with Bob would need to be at least $15,000 for me to prefer it over selling to John.
