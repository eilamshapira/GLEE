"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer of $15,000 is higher than the maximum value of $12,000 that the product is worth to me, and it's also higher than John's fixed price of $12,000, it doesn't make sense to accept Alice's offer. I could try to negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, but John is already offering the product at my maximum value point. There's no guarantee Alice would accept any offer below $15,000 (which is what the product is worth to her).
