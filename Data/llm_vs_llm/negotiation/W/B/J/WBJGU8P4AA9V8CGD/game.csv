"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $5000 for the product.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but $5000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'll lower my initial offer, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $17500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to find a middle ground. I'll offer $7500 for the product.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $7500. I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to lower my previous offer again, but not as low as $7500. I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and your new offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway. However, $12500 is still above my budget. Considering your offer and my previous offer, I'm willing to increase my offer again. I'll offer $9000 for the product.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $9000. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I need to emphasize that $9000 is still quite far from my target price. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I expect a more significant increase from your side if we're to reach an agreement. I'll lower my previous offer slightly, hoping you'll consider meeting me closer to a fair price.",12000.0,Alice,7,
