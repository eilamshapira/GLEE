"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $5000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $5000 because it's significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product, which is $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a more reasonable offer. I'll proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer that better reflects the product's value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $20,000 might be out of your budget, but $5,000 is too low for me.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $17500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to find a middle ground. I'll offer $7500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $7500 because it's still below the minimum value I have for the product, which is $15,000. Although Bob is increasing his offer, the gap between his offer and my initial valuation is significant. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to find a mutually beneficial price. I'll proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $7500. I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to lower my previous offer again, but not as low as $7500. I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and your new offer."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway. However, $12500 is still above my budget. Considering your offer and my previous offer, I'm willing to increase my offer again. I'll offer $9000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $9000 because, although he's getting closer to a reasonable price, it's still below the minimum value I have for the product, which is $15,000, and significantly lower than my last counteroffer. I'm starting to think that Bob might not be willing to meet me at a fair price, but I'll give him one more chance to increase his offer substantially. I'll proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer, trying to encourage Bob to meet me closer to my target price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $9000. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I need to emphasize that $9000 is still quite far from my target price. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I expect a more significant increase from your side if we're to reach an agreement. I'll lower my previous offer slightly, hoping you'll consider meeting me closer to a fair price."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
