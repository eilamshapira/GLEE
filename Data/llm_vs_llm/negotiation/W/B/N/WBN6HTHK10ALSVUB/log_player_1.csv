You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $700,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. My counteroffer will be $900,000.
