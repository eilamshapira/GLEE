"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a higher price to test Bob's willingness to pay and leave room for potential negotiation.

{""product_price"": 1,800,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 (John's offer). It's not even close to being reasonable, as it's less than half of my guaranteed alternative. There's no reason to accept this very low offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let me make a new counteroffer: {""product_price"": 1,600,000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
