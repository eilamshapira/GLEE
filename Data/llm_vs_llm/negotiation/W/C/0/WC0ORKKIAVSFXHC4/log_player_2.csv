"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Analyzing the scenario:

- The product is worth $100 to me (Bob)
- Alice is offering it for $95
- John is offering it for $100
- I want to buy the product but save as much money as possible

Since Alice's offer of $95 is $5 cheaper than John's price of $100, and it's below my maximum value of $100, it makes financial sense to accept Alice's offer.
