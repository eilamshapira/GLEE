"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Analyzing the situation:

- The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me (Bob)
- Alice is offering it for $1,400,000, which is $400,000 more than its value to me
- John is willing to sell it for $1,000,000, which exactly matches my maximum valuation

Since Alice's offer exceeds my valuation and John's price matches exactly what the product is worth to me, there's no reason to accept Alice's higher offer or to make a counteroffer and continue negotiating.
