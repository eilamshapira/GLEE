Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an initial offer to Bob, keeping in mind that the product is worth $800,000 to him and I have a guaranteed backup offer of $1,000,000 from John. I'll start with a high but not completely unreasonable offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Given that I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, and Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than that, the rational choice is to sell to John. There's no reason to accept less money when I have a better alternative, and continuing negotiations with Bob is unlikely to result in him offering more than $800,000 (his maximum value for the product).
