"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than John's price. It makes sense to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This is a starting offer significantly lower than Alice's, but still potentially profitable for her. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}

Alice came down a bit, but it's still too high. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 650000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're increasing our offer slightly to show Alice we're willing to move, but we're still staying significantly below her offer. We're aiming to find a middle ground quickly while staying under our John's price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice is slowly coming down, but we're getting closer to John's price. We'll reject and make one more strong counteroffer before considering John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 725000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This offer is a significant jump from our previous offer, signaling to Alice that we're serious but also that we need her to move closer to our range. It's a last attempt to find common ground before considering John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
```

Alice is unlikely to come down significantly from this point. It's not worth risking missing out on John's offer for a potential savings of $50,000 or less at this point."
