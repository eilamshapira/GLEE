"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $1,350,000 exceeds that value, I will not accept her offer. Additionally, I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which aligns with my budget. Therefore, I will choose to buy the product from John, as it saves me $350,000 compared to Alice's offer.
