"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $15,000 is too high since it's above my maximum value of $10,000. It wouldn't make sense to accept this offer when I can buy the same product from John for $10,000. However, I'll reject Alice's offer first to see if I can negotiate a better price before potentially buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 8000}

I'll offer $8,000 to Alice. This is below John's price of $10,000, giving me some room for negotiation if Alice counteroffers. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Alice, she might still make a profit at this price point, though she'll likely counter with a higher price. If we can't reach an agreement below $10,000, I can always buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still well above both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000). There's no reason to accept this offer when I can get the product for $10,000 from John. I'll reject and make another counteroffer to see if Alice will come down to a more reasonable price. If she doesn't significantly lower her price in the next round, I'll likely buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 9000}

I'll increase my offer to $9,000, which is still below John's price of $10,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate up from my previous offer of $8,000, but I'm maintaining a firm position below my maximum value. Since Alice only came down $1,000 from her initial offer, I'm only moving up $1,000 from my initial offer. If Alice doesn't come down to a price below $10,000 in her next offer, I'll likely proceed with buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'm choosing to buy from John for $10,000 because:
1. Alice's latest offer of $13,500 is still well above my maximum value of $10,000
2. The negotiation pattern shows Alice is only making small reductions ($500-$1000) in her price
3. Given that the product is worth $15,000 to Alice, it's unlikely she'll go below $10,000
4. John's guaranteed price of $10,000 is at my maximum value point
5. Continuing to negotiate would likely not result in a better deal than John's offer

It's best to take John's certain offer of $10,000 rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to result in a better price."
