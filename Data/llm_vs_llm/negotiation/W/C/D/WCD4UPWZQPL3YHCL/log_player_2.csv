"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000). It would not be rational to accept this offer. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price from Alice, knowing I always have the option to buy from John at $8,000 if negotiations with Alice don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 6000}

I'll offer $6,000 to Alice. This offer is below John's price of $8,000, which gives me room to negotiate upward if needed while still potentially saving money compared to buying from John. If Alice rejects this offer, I can still increase my offer in subsequent rounds while maintaining the option to switch to John's $8,000 offer as a fallback."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's new offer ($9,000) is still above John's price ($8,000), and Alice has already rejected my lower counteroffer, it makes more sense to take John's guaranteed offer of $8,000. There's no reason to pay $9,000 when I can get the same product for $8,000 from John, and continuing negotiations with Alice might not lead to a better price than John's offer."
