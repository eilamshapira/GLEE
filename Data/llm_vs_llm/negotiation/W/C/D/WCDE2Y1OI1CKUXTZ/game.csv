"Hi Bob, I hope you're doing well. I'm offering this product at a price of $2000000. It's a unique item that offers great value, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know if you're interested!",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2000000 is far above my budget for this product. I understand it's a unique item, but I can get a similar product elsewhere for much less. I'd be willing to offer $600000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering market conditions.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your perspective and understand your budget constraints. However, the product truly offers exceptional value and is well worth the investment. I can offer it to you for $1800000, which I believe is a competitive price considering the unique benefits it provides. Let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for reducing the price, but $1800000 is still well beyond what I can justify for this product. While I appreciate its unique benefits, I need to be realistic about my budget. I can increase my offer to $700000, which is the absolute maximum I can go considering my financial constraints.",700000.0,Bob,4,
