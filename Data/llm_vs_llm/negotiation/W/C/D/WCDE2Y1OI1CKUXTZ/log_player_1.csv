Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2000000 is far above my budget for this product. I understand it's a unique item, but I can get a similar product elsewhere for much less. I'd be willing to offer $600000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering market conditions.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
