"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I hope you're doing well. I'm offering this product at a price of $2000000. It's a unique item that offers great value, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000, and it's also much higher than John's offer. There's no reason to accept this offer when I can either try to negotiate with Alice for a better price or ultimately buy from John for $800,000. I'll reject and make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2,000,000 is far above my budget for this product. I understand it's a unique item, but I can get a similar product elsewhere for much less. I'd be willing to offer $600,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering market conditions."", ""product_price"": 600000}

I'm offering $600,000, which is below John's price of $800,000, giving me room to negotiate upward if necessary while still maintaining the possibility of saving money compared to John's offer. Starting with a lower offer allows for potential back-and-forth negotiation while keeping John's price as my backup option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your perspective and understand your budget constraints. However, the product truly offers exceptional value and is well worth the investment. I can offer it to you for $1800000, which I believe is a competitive price considering the unique benefits it provides. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,800,000, while lower than her initial offer, is still more than twice my maximum value of $800,000. Even though she reduced the price by $200,000, we're still very far apart on price. Since John's offer of $800,000 remains available and matches my maximum value, I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer with Alice. If we can't reach a reasonable price, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for reducing the price, but $1,800,000 is still well beyond what I can justify for this product. While I appreciate its unique benefits, I need to be realistic about my budget. I can increase my offer to $700,000, which is the absolute maximum I can go considering my financial constraints."", ""product_price"": 700000}

I'm offering $700,000, which is still below John's price but shows movement from my initial offer. This gives Alice the signal that I'm willing to negotiate while keeping the price below my maximum alternative of $800,000 from John. If Alice doesn't accept this or come back with a reasonable counter, I can still fall back on John's offer."
