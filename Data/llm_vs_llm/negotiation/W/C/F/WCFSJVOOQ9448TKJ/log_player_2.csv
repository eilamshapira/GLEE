"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Looking at my options carefully:

1. Alice is offering the product for $200, which is more than the $100 maximum value it has to me.
2. I could counteroffer with a lower price.
3. I can buy from John for $100, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since the product is only worth $100 to me, paying $200 would be a loss. While I could try negotiating with Alice, I already have a guaranteed option to buy at my maximum valuation from John. There's no reason to pay more than $100 or risk a lengthy negotiation when I can immediately get the product at a fair price.
