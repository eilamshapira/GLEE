Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll offer the product at a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while still ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $60 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, accepting Bob's low offer makes no sense. While I could make a counteroffer, given that Bob's initial offer is so low and I have a guaranteed better option, the best decision is to sell to John.
