"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $1,400,000, I need to consider my alternatives:

1. Alice's offer ($1,400,000) is more than the product is worth to me (max $1,200,000)
2. I can buy from John for exactly $1,200,000, which matches my maximum valuation
3. I could counteroffer Alice, but she values the product at $1,500,000, so she's unlikely to go below $1,200,000

Since Alice's current offer exceeds my maximum valuation, and I have a guaranteed option to buy at my maximum valuation, I'll reject Alice's offer to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still reasonable enough to potentially start meaningful negotiations.
