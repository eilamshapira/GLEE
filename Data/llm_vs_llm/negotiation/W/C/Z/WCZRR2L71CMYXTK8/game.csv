"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be beneficial for you. After careful consideration, I'd like to offer it to you for $1800000. This premium product represents a significant value opportunity. Please let me know your thoughts on this offer.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1800000 is significantly above my budget and the value I place on this product. I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $1000000. I'd like to do business with you instead if possible, so I'm willing to offer $900000 for your product. This would save me some money while allowing you to make a sale. Please let me know if this works for you.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, I need to clarify that my product has unique features and quality that differentiate it from what you might find elsewhere. While I understand your budget constraints, $900000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. The product is worth at least $1500000 to me based on its cost and value. I can offer it to you at $1600000, which represents a reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of what you're getting. This is a competitive price considering the product's quality and potential return on investment for you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand you value your product highly, and I appreciate that it may have unique features. However, I need to be transparent that the maximum value this product represents to me is $1000000. That's what the product is worth to my business needs. In fact, John is offering me the same product for exactly $1000000. Since I'd prefer to do business with you, I'm willing to offer you $950000, which gives you a quick sale and saves me a bit compared to John's offer. If we can't reach an agreement near this price point, I'll unfortunately need to proceed with John's offer instead.",950000.0,Bob,4,
