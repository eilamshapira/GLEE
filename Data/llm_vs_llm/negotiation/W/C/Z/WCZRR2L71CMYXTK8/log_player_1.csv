Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1800000 is significantly above my budget and the value I place on this product. I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $1000000. I'd like to do business with you instead if possible, so I'm willing to offer $900000 for your product. This would save me some money while allowing you to make a sale. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, I need to clarify that my product has unique features and quality that differentiate it from what you might find elsewhere. While I understand your budget constraints, $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. The product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me based on its cost and value. I can offer it to you at $1,600,000, which represents a reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of what you're getting. This is a competitive price considering the product's quality and potential return on investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand you value your product highly, and I appreciate that it may have unique features. However, I need to be transparent that the maximum value this product represents to me is $1000000. That's what the product is worth to my business needs. In fact, John is offering me the same product for exactly $1000000. Since I'd prefer to do business with you, I'm willing to offer you $950000, which gives you a quick sale and saves me a bit compared to John's offer. If we can't reach an agreement near this price point, I'll unfortunately need to proceed with John's offer instead.
