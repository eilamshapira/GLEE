"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be beneficial for you. After careful consideration, I'd like to offer it to you for $1800000. This premium product represents a significant value opportunity. Please let me know your thoughts on this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I'll analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering the product for $1,800,000
2. The product is worth at most $1,000,000 to me
3. John is willing to sell it for $1,000,000
4. Alice's product is worth $1,500,000 to her

Alice's offer of $1,800,000 exceeds my maximum value for the product. It makes no sense to pay more than what the product is worth to me. Since John offers the product at exactly my maximum valuation, that would be the most I should pay.

I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $1,000,000. I'd like to do business with you instead if possible, so I'm willing to offer $900,000 for your product. This would save me some money while allowing you to make a sale. Please let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, I need to clarify that my product has unique features and quality that differentiate it from what you might find elsewhere. While I understand your budget constraints, $900000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. The product is worth at least $1500000 to me based on its cost and value. I can offer it to you at $1600000, which represents a reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of what you're getting. This is a competitive price considering the product's quality and potential return on investment for you.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,600,000 is still above my maximum valuation of $1,000,000 for the product. Even if the product has unique features as Alice claims, it doesn't change the fact that it's worth no more than $1,000,000 to me.

John is offering the exact same product for $1,000,000, which matches my maximum valuation. There's no reason for me to pay $600,000 more to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I understand you value your product highly, and I appreciate that it may have unique features. However, I need to be transparent that the maximum value this product represents to me is $1,000,000. That's what the product is worth to my business needs. In fact, John is offering me the same product for exactly $1,000,000. Since I'd prefer to do business with you, I'm willing to offer you $950,000, which gives you a quick sale and saves me a bit compared to John's offer. If we can't reach an agreement near this price point, I'll unfortunately need to proceed with John's offer instead."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
