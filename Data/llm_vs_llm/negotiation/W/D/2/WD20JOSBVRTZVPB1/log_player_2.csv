"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer of $20,000 is higher than my maximum value of $15,000 and also higher than John's price of $15,000, it would be most rational to buy from John. There's no reason to pay $5,000 more for the same product.
