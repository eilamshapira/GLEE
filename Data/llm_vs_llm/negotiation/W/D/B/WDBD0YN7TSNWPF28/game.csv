"Hi Alice,  $2000000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product but my budget is capped at $800000. Would you be willing to consider that offer? ",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is significantly below what I need to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900000.  This would be a fair compromise and allow us to both move forward.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $900000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1050000.  This price is fair given the product's value and my own needs. Let's try to close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $900000.  This is the highest I can go, and I'm hopeful we can reach a deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
