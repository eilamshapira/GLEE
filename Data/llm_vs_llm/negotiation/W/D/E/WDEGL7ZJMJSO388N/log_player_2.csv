"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given the information provided, I need to make a decision about buying a product from Alice or John.

Alice's offer is $2,000,000, which exceeds the maximum value the product is worth to me ($800,000). Meanwhile, John is offering the same product for $800,000, which is exactly my maximum value.

Since Alice's offer is significantly higher than both John's price and the maximum value to me, there's no reason to accept it or enter into a negotiation process that starts from such a high initial offer.
