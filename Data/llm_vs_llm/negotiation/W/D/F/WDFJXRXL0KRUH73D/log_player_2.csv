"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’d like to offer you the chance to acquire this exclusive product. I’m offering it at $100000. Should you decide to take it up, it can be yours at that price. In any event, if this offer isn’t right for you, I do have another interested buyer at $15000—so the opportunity to secure this premium item at my offered price won’t be available for long. I look forward to your reply. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

1. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $100,000
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $10,000

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both the product's value to me and John's price. Although Alice mentions another buyer at $15,000 to create urgency, this doesn't affect my decision since I have a guaranteed option with John at $10,000.

The rational choice is to buy from John at $10,000, which matches the maximum value I place on the product.
