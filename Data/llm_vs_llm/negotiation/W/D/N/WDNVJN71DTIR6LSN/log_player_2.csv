"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2500000. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm open to negotiations if you have a different valuation in mind. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Given the information provided, I need to make a decision that maximizes my value.

Alice is offering the product for $2,500,000, which is $1,000,000 more than what the product is worth to me (maximum $1,500,000). Additionally, I know I can definitely get the product from John for exactly $1,500,000.

Since Alice's offer exceeds the maximum value I place on the product, and also exceeds my alternative option (buying from John), the rational choice is to either reject and make a counteroffer or buy from John directly.

Since I can always buy from John as a fallback option, there's no risk in trying a counteroffer with Alice first. However, in this particular case, since Alice's initial offer is so much higher than my maximum valuation, and I have a guaranteed option at my maximum value point, the most efficient decision is:
