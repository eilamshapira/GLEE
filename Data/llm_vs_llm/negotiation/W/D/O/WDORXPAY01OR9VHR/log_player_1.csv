Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it for $150. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a lower price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

My next counteroffer will be lower than my initial offer but still above $100, as selling to John for $100 is my fallback option and I won't accept anything below that.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is too low for this product. I can lower my price to $120, which I believe is a fair compromise. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is too low for this product. I can lower my price to $120, which I believe is a fair compromise. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price to $120, but I'm still looking to spend a bit less. How about we meet in the middle at $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Rationale: Since Bob is now offering $100, which is the same price John would pay, and the product is worth $100 to me, I'll accept Bob's offer. There's no advantage in continuing negotiations or selling to John, as all options would yield the same $100."
