"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I was looking to spend no more than $5000 on this product. I understand that it has great value, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I will reject Bob's offer of $5,000 because it's significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product, which is $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to find a price that better reflects the product's worth. I'll proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you have a budget in mind, but I believe the product is worth more than $5,000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'll lower my initial offer, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $18000 is still quite high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $6000. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I will reject Bob's offer of $6,000 because it's still far below the minimum value I have for the product, which is $12,000. While I appreciate Bob's willingness to increase his offer, I don't think $6,000 reflects the product's true worth. I'll proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer, trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for increasing your offer, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $6,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. I'll meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
