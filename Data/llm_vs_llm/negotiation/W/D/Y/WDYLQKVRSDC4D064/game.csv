"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. It's valued at $200, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. This is a competitive price for the value you'll be getting. Are you interested?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand that the product is of high quality, but $180 is still a bit steep for my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $60, considering I can also buy it from John for $80.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. The product is worth significantly more than $60, and I already have an offer from John for $100. I could come down to $150, which is still a great value considering the quality and market price of this product. Let me know if this works for you.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand that you have another offer from John for $100, but I'm not willing to pay $150. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $70, which is still a reasonable price considering the market conditions. If we can't agree on a price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $80.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be clear that I already have a firm offer from John for $100. Your mention of buying from John for $80 seems inconsistent with that. Given that I can sell to John for $100 right now, I can't accept anything lower than that. However, I'm willing to offer you the product for $125, which is still significantly lower than my initial price and represents good value. Would you consider meeting me at this price?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I apologize for any inconsistency regarding John's offer. I can assure you that I do have the option to buy from John for $80, and that's my benchmark. Considering you're willing to sell to me for less than your initial price, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $125 is still above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80, which matches the price I can get from John. If you're willing to accept this, I'm ready to make the purchase immediately.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, there seems to be some confusion. I want to be absolutely clear that I have a concrete offer from John to buy the product for $100, not $80. This is a guaranteed sale I can make right now. While I'd prefer to sell to you, I simply cannot accept less than what John is offering me. My final counteroffer is $110, which is just a small premium over my alternative option. This is as low as I can go while still making business sense for me. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",110.0,Alice,7,
