Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. It's valued at $200, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. This is a competitive price for the value you'll be getting. Are you interested?"", ""product_price"": 180}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand that the product is of high quality, but $180 is still a bit steep for my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $60, considering I can also buy it from John for $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand that you have another offer from John for $100, but I'm not willing to pay $150. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $70, which is still a reasonable price considering the market conditions. If we can't agree on a price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $80.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be clear that I already have a firm offer from John for $100. Your mention of buying from John for $80 seems inconsistent with that. Given that I can sell to John for $100 right now, I can't accept anything lower than that. However, I'm willing to offer you the product for $125, which is still significantly lower than my initial price and represents good value. Would you consider meeting me at this price?"", ""product_price"": 125}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I apologize for any inconsistency regarding John's offer. I can assure you that I do have the option to buy from John for $80, and that's my benchmark. Considering you're willing to sell to me for less than your initial price, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $125 is still above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80, which matches the price I can get from John. If you're willing to accept this, I'm ready to make the purchase immediately.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, there seems to be some confusion. I want to be absolutely clear that I have a concrete offer from John to buy the product for $100, not $80. This is a guaranteed sale I can make right now. While I'd prefer to sell to you, I simply cannot accept less than what John is offering me. My final counteroffer is $110, which is just a small premium over my alternative option. This is as low as I can go while still making business sense for me.
