"Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a price of $130. I believe it offers excellent value at this price, considering its quality and features. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $130 is a bit high for my budget. Given the market conditions, I'd be comfortable paying $95 for this item. This would still give you a good profit margin while being more affordable for me. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget concerns, but $95 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Could you meet me halfway at $115?  I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price that reflects the true value of the item.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. How about we meet in the middle at $105? That seems like a fair compromise that would work well for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
