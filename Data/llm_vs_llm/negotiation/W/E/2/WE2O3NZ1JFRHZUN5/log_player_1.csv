Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $130 is a bit high for my budget. Given the market conditions, I'd be comfortable paying $95 for this item. This would still give you a good profit margin while being more affordable for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
