"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision that maximizes my economic benefit.

Let me analyze my options:
1. Accept Alice's offer: Pay $1,000,000 for the product
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John: Pay $1,200,000 for the product

The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, and Alice is offering it at $1,000,000, which is $200,000 less than John's price and below my maximum valuation. This is a good deal for me.
