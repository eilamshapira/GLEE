"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Here's my reasoning and decision:

*   **My Valuation:** The product is worth $120 to me.
*   **Alice's Offer:** $100
*   **John's Offer:** $120

Since Alice's offer of $100 is less than John's offer of $120, I should accept Alice's offer.
