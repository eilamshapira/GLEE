Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $20,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to me, but I'm open to negotiations if you're genuinely interested."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. My budget for this product is much lower. I'd like to offer $8000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is lower than what John is willing to pay ($10,000), and it's also lower than the product's worth to me, I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I still have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price from Bob. 

Here's my counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $8,000 is below my expectations. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to offer it to you for $18,000."", ""product_price"": 18000}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand you value the product highly. However, $18000 is still too much for me. My maximum budget for this item is $12000. I can offer you $10000. Please consider it.

Since Bob's offer of $10,000 matches what John is willing to pay, and further negotiations may not yield a better price, I'll accept Bob's offer. This way, I'll still get the minimum price I was willing to accept, and I won't risk losing the sale or having to sell it to John instead."
