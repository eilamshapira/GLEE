"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $20000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to me, but I'm open to negotiations if you're genuinely interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","The offer is $20,000, but I value the product at no more than $12,000. I can buy it from John for $12,000. So, I should reject the offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, I will make a counteroffer. Since I value the product at $12,000, I will start with a low offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alright, Alice is still way above my maximum value. I'll try a slightly higher offer, but I'll also remind her of my limit.
