Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you, Alice, for your offer. However, I was hoping to spend a bit less on this purchase. How about we settle for $900000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $900,000 because it's still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm making a counteroffer of $1,000,000, which is closer to the product's value to him and gives us some room for further negotiation."

Round 4

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $850,000 because it's still lower than what I'm aiming for. Since Bob is trying to keep his budget below $900,000, I'm making a counteroffer of $950,000, which is closer to his budget limit and gives us some room for further negotiation. This price is also more favorable to me than selling to John for $800,000."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $900,000 again because I believe I can get a slightly better price. Since Bob is adamant about his budget and has revisited his previous offer, I'm making a counteroffer of $920,000.
