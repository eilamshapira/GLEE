"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget considerations, I can't go as low as $12000 as the product is worth significantly more. The product has a market value that I need to respect, and I already have another buyer willing to pay $15000. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can come down to $16500, which is still a good value considering the product's quality and worth.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. Given that you have another buyer willing to pay $15000 and I'm a serious buyer, I'd like to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to pay $14250 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise.",14250.0,Bob,4,
