Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget considerations, I can't go as low as $12,000 as the product is worth significantly more. The product has a market value that I need to respect, and I already have another buyer willing to pay $15,000. However, I'd like to work with you if possible.
