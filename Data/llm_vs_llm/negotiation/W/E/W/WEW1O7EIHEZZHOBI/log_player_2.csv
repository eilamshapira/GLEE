"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think about this strategically:

1. My maximum value for the product is $150
2. John's offer of $150 is my worst-case scenario
3. Alice's offer of $120 is already $30 less than John's price
4. While I could try to negotiate lower by rejecting and making a counteroffer, there's a risk Alice might increase her price in subsequent rounds
5. $120 is a reasonable price as it saves me $30 compared to John's offer

Given these considerations, Alice's offer of $120 is already good and represents a significant saving compared to John's price. It's better to accept this favorable offer rather than risk losing it by trying to negotiate further.
