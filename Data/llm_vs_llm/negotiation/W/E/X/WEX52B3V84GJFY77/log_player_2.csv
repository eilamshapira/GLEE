"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000.  It's a fantastic opportunity, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's initial offer is exactly at my maximum budget of $15,000, and I have the option to buy the same product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in accepting Alice's offer immediately without trying to negotiate a better price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in hopes of getting a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, while still being reasonable. This will give us room to negotiate and potentially find a mutually agreeable price.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13000. This is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has come down from her initial offer of $15,000 to $13,000, which is a positive step. However, I still believe there's room for further negotiation. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, I'll reject Alice's current offer and make another counteroffer.

This time, I'll aim for a price that's between my previous offer of $10,000 and Alice's current offer of $13,000, to see if we can meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I'll send a new counteroffer: 

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $13,000. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"
