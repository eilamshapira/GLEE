"Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I should consider this offer carefully, comparing it to my alternatives.

Alice is offering the product for $19,000, which is $7,000 more than the $12,000 it's worth to me. Even if I were to buy it at this price, I would be losing value.

John is offering the same product for exactly $12,000, which equals the maximum value of the product to me. While this breaks even (no loss or gain), it's much better than Alice's current offer.

Since Alice's price is significantly higher than both my valuation and John's alternative price, the best decision is to buy from John.
