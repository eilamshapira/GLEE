Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make an offer that maximizes my expected profit. Since the product is worth at least $8,000 to me and I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, I should offer Bob a price that's higher than $8,000.

If I set the price too high, Bob might reject it, but I still get $8,000 from John. If I set it at a reasonable premium above $8,000, Bob might accept if the product has sufficient value to him.

I'll offer the product at a price of $12,000, which gives Bob the opportunity to buy if he values it significantly more than my minimum, while ensuring I make a good profit above my guaranteed alternative.
