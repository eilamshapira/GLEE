"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $18,000. This is a competitive price for the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $18000 is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $9000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will send a counteroffer since Bob's offer of $9,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 (what John is willing to pay), but his interest suggests there might be room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $9,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. Given the product's value, I can reduce my initial price to $15,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, reflecting my willingness to work with you."", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for lowering the price. However, $15000 is still too high for me. My maximum budget is $12000, and I am willing to offer you $10000 for the product.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob has indicated he has a maximum budget of $12,000, I'll make one more attempt to secure a better price than John's offer.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you sharing your budget constraints, Bob. Since you mentioned your maximum budget is $12,000, I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000, which is the absolute best price I can offer considering its value.
