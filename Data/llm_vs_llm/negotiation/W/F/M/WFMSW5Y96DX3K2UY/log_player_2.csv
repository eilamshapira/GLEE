"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’d like to offer you this premium product for $20000. It’s a unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its exceptional quality and value. Please let me know if you’re interested in moving forward with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since the offer from Alice is $20,000, which is more than I'm willing to pay ($8,000), I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $8,000.
