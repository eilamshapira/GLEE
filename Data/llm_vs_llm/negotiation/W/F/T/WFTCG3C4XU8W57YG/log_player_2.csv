"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","The offer from Alice is $20,000, which is significantly above the product's worth to me ($10,000) and even higher than what Alice values it at ($15,000). It's also double the price that John is offering ($10,000).

Since I want to save as much money as possible, and the product is only worth $10,000 to me, it makes no sense to accept Alice's offer of $20,000. I could try to make a counteroffer, but John's offer of $10,000 is already at my maximum valuation point, and there's no guarantee that Alice would accept a counteroffer that's reasonable for me.
