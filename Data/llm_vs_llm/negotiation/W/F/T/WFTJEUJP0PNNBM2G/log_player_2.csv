"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Given that the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for $800,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $950,000. Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

I'll offer $700,000 to Alice. This is a reasonable counteroffer because:
1. It's below John's price of $800,000, giving me potential savings
2. Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, this offer still gives her room to negotiate while leaving me with some potential savings
3. If Alice rejects this offer, we still have several rounds to negotiate and potentially find a middle ground that works for both of us
4. Even if negotiations fail, I always have the option to go with John's offer of $800,000"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer of $900,000 because:
1. It's still significantly higher than John's price of $800,000
2. Since Alice has moved down from her initial offer of $950,000 to $900,000, it shows she has room to negotiate further
3. We still have several rounds left to negotiate
4. The worst-case scenario is still buying from John at $800,000, which is better than accepting $900,000
5. Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, there might be room to negotiate a price that benefits both parties

I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 750000}

I'll offer $750,000 to Alice. This is a strategic counteroffer because:
1. It's a $50,000 increase from my previous offer of $700,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. It's still $50,000 below John's price, leaving me with potential savings
3. Given that the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, this offer would still give her a reasonable profit while being more attractive than my previous offer
4. It splits the difference between my last offer ($700,000) and John's price ($800,000)
5. If Alice rejects this offer, I still have several rounds to negotiate or can fall back on John's offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John for $800,000 because:
1. Alice's current offer ($850,000) is still above John's price ($800,000)
2. The pattern of negotiations suggests Alice is unlikely to go below $800,000, as that's the product's worth to her
3. While Alice has been coming down in price ($950k → $900k → $850k), continuing to negotiate further rounds risks:
   - Wasting time
   - Alice potentially becoming less flexible
   - Still ending up having to go with John's offer anyway
4. Since $800,000 is also my maximum value for the product, John's price is the most rational choice
5. Taking John's offer now gives me certainty and the best price we've seen in the negotiation"
