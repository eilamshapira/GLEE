"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Given the information:
- The product is worth no more than $150 to you
- Alice is offering the product for $150
- John is willing to sell the product for $150

There's no price advantage between Alice's and John's offers as both are selling for $150. Since both options would cost you the same amount, I'll accept Alice's offer.
