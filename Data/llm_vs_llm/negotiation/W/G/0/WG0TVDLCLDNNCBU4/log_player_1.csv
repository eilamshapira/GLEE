Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine an optimal price to offer Bob. If Bob rejects my offer, I'm guaranteed $8,000 from John, so I shouldn't offer a price below that threshold.

Since I don't know how much the product is worth to Bob, I'll set a price that gives me a reasonable chance of earning more than my guaranteed $8,000, while not being so high that Bob will certainly reject it.
