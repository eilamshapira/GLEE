Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 119}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $105 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($100) but lower than what I initially hoped for, and considering Bob's true value for the product is $120, I believe there's room for negotiation to get closer to my initial offer or at least ensure I get a better deal than selling to John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Considering Bob's offer of $105 and his true value of $120, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my initial offer but still reflects the product's worth to both of us.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's new offer of $110 is getting closer to a price that I consider reasonable, given that it's still below his true value of $120 but significantly above the minimum I'm willing to accept ($100) and the alternative offer from John ($100).

At this point, accepting $110 seems like a good compromise, as it's a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or no sale at all.
