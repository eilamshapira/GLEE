"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer of $110, make a counteroffer, or buy from John for $120.

The product is worth at most $120 to me. Alice's offer of $110 is less than my maximum price and less than John's fixed price of $120.

While I could try to make a counteroffer to save more money, Alice's current offer already saves me $10 compared to buying from John. This is a reasonable price that provides me with some savings.
