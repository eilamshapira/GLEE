"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'll gain from it. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $90, I need to consider the value this product brings. It's a high-quality item that's worth significantly more in the market. I can come down to $110, which I believe is still a great deal considering what you'll get from it. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $110. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
