Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $11,500. It's a great value and I think you'll be very pleased with it."", ""product_price"": 11500}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but my budget doesn't stretch that high. Would you consider closing the deal at $10200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I have decided to reject Bob's offer to sell the product for $10,200. Since the product's value to me is not less than $10,000, I believe there is still room for negotiation to achieve a better price. Let's proceed to the next round where I will send Bob a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the product's value is higher. Let's meet in the middle at $10,850. This way, we both make some concessions."", ""product_price"": 10850}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your position and your efforts to meet in the middle. However, my limits remain firm given the budget I have for this purchase. Would you consider closing the deal at $10600? I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's latest offer of $10,600 is reasonably close to my valuation, and it's clear that his budget has limited room for maneuvering. Accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale without the risk of losing the deal entirely. Therefore, I accept Bob's offer of $10,600."
