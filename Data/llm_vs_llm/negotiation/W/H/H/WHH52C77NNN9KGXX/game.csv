"Hello Bob, I'm reaching out to offer you a premium product that I believe could be of significant value to you. Based on the quality and benefits it provides, I'm offering it at $15000. This price reflects its exceptional market value and potential return on investment. I look forward to your response and am open to discussing the offer further.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $15000 is the absolute maximum I could pay for this product, and I can get it from another seller at that same price. I'd like to work with you instead, but I would need a better price to make that happen. Would you consider $11500? This would provide me with some cost savings while still giving you a fair return.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product and for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better price, but $11500 is too close to my minimum acceptable price of $10000, which doesn't leave me with much margin. I can offer you the product for $14000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents excellent value considering the product's quality and market worth. This price still gives you a better deal than the $15000 you mentioned other sellers are charging. I'm confident we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $14000 - I appreciate the reduction. I notice you mentioned your minimum acceptable price is $10000, and I understand you need a reasonable margin. Let's meet closer to the middle. I can offer $12500, which gives you a $2500 margin above your minimum while still providing me with some savings compared to other options. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,4,
