Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $15000 is the absolute maximum I could pay for this product, and I can get it from another seller at that same price. I'd like to work with you instead, but I would need a better price to make that happen. Would you consider $11500? This would provide me with some cost savings while still giving you a fair return. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product and for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better price, but $11,500 is too close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, which doesn't leave me with much margin. I can offer you the product for $14,000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents excellent value considering the product's quality and market worth. This price still gives you a better deal than the $15,000 you mentioned other sellers are charging. I'm confident we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $14000 - I appreciate the reduction. I notice you mentioned your minimum acceptable price is $10000, and I understand you need a reasonable margin. Let's meet closer to the middle. I can offer $12500, which gives you a $2500 margin above your minimum while still providing me with some savings compared to other options. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both. What do you think?
