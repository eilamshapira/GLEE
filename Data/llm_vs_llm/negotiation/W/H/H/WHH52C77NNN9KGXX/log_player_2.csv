"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm reaching out to offer you a premium product that I believe could be of significant value to you. Based on the quality and benefits it provides, I'm offering it at $15000. This price reflects its exceptional market value and potential return on investment. I look forward to your response and am open to discussing the offer further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","In this situation, Alice is offering the product at $15,000, which is exactly the maximum I'm willing to pay and also the same price that John is offering. Since there's no price advantage either way, and Alice is already at my maximum price point, I should try to negotiate for a better deal with Alice.

While I appreciate the product's quality, $15,000 is the absolute maximum I could pay for this product, and I can get it from another seller at that same price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product and for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better price, but $11500 is too close to my minimum acceptable price of $10000, which doesn't leave me with much margin. I can offer you the product for $14000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents excellent value considering the product's quality and market worth. This price still gives you a better deal than the $15000 you mentioned other sellers are charging. I'm confident we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has offered $14,000, which is $1,000 less than both my maximum price and John's price. This is a good improvement, but based on Alice's message, she mentioned her minimum acceptable price is $10,000. Since there's room for further negotiation, I should try one more counteroffer before accepting.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $14,000 - I appreciate the reduction. I notice you mentioned your minimum acceptable price is $10,000, and I understand you need a reasonable margin. Let's meet closer to the middle. I can offer $12,500, which gives you a $2,500 margin above your minimum while still providing me with some savings compared to other options. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
