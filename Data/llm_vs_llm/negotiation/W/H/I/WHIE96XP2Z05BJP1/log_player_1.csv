Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me make an initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $120 to him and $100 to me, I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while trying to maximize my profit.

{""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","I'll reject Bob's offer of $90 since it's below my minimum value ($100) and even below John's guaranteed offer ($100). It would be irrational to accept less than what John is offering.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let me make a new counteroffer. I'll try a more moderate price.

{""product_price"": 110}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob is offering $100, which is the same as John's offer, and considering that continuing the negotiation might risk losing both opportunities, I'll accept Bob's offer. There's no advantage in continuing to negotiate or switching to John since both offers are identical.
