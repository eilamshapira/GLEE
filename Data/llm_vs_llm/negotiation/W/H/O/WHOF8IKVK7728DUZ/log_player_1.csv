Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that Bob values the product at $80 and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $80, I should offer the product to Bob at exactly $80.

If I offer higher than $80, Bob will definitely reject since it exceeds his valuation. If I offer lower than $80, I'm leaving money on the table since I can get $80 from John anyway.
