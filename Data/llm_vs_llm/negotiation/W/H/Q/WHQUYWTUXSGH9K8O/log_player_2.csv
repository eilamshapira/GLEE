"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let's analyze the situation:

*   **Alice's offer:** $110
*   **Your value:** $120
*   **Buy from John:** $120

Since the product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $110, buying from Alice is better than buying from John. Therefore, the best decision is to accept Alice's offer.
