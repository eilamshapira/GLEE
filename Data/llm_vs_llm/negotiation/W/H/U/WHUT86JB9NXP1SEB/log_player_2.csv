"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to carefully consider my options here:

1. Accept Alice's offer for $12,000 - This is higher than the maximum value of $10,000 that the product is worth to me, so this would be a poor decision.

2. Reject and make a counteroffer - This allows me to negotiate for a better price.

3. Buy from John for $10,000 - This guarantees I get the product at exactly its maximum value to me.

Since Alice's initial offer exceeds the product's value to me, and John is offering exactly the maximum I'm willing to pay, I should either reject and try to negotiate a better deal with Alice or buy from John immediately. Given that John's price is guaranteed and represents my maximum acceptable price, the prudent choice is:
