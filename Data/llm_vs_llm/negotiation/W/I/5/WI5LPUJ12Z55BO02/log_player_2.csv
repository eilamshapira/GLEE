"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: $950,000
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John: $1,000,000

Since:
- The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me
- Alice's offer ($950,000) is less than John's price ($1,000,000)
- By accepting Alice's offer, I can save $50,000 compared to buying from John

The logical choice is to accept Alice's offer as it saves me money while still getting the product I need.
