"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully. She's offering the product at $140, which is less than John's price of $150, but still seems high considering the product is worth only $100 to her.

Since this is just round 1 of 10 possible rounds, I have plenty of opportunity to negotiate a better price. Alice has significant room to lower her price while still making a profit, so I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has lowered her price from $140 to $130, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, I know the product is only worth $100 to her, so there's still significant room for a better deal. We're only in round 3 of 10, so I still have time to negotiate further.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

We're at round 5 of 10, so I still have time to negotiate further before considering John's fixed price of $150.
