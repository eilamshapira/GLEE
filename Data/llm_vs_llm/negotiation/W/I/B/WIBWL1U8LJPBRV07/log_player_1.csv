Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an initial offer to Bob that's close to his maximum value but leaves some room for negotiation if needed.

{""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","I'll reject Bob's offer since $110 is still notably below the product's value to Bob ($120). I believe there's room to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll slightly lower my previous offer but still maintain a good profit margin.
