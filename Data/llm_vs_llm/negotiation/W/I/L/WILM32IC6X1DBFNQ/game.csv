"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $900000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go. How about I lower my price to $1700000? I believe this is a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts!",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for lowering your price. However, $1700000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to meet you in the middle between my previous offer and your current offer. How about $1300000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your latest offer. However, I believe the value of this product is higher than $1300000. How about we settle at $1600000? I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1600000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Considering your last offer and my previous one, I'd like to propose a price of $1450000. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
