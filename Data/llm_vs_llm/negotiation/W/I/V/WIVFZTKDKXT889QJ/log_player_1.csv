Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my offer to Bob. 

I know that:
- The product is worth at least $10,000 to me
- The product is worth $8,000 to Bob
- If Bob rejects my offer, I can sell to John for $10,000

Since the product is only worth $8,000 to Bob, he will reject any offer above that amount. And since I can sell to John for $10,000, I have no incentive to sell to Bob for less than $10,000.

Given these constraints, it makes the most sense for me to offer the product to Bob at a price that ensures I'll end up selling to John instead.
