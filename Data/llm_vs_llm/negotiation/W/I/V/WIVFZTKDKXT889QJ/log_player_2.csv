"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $10,000 and considering my options:

1) The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, so paying $10,000 would be a loss of at least $2,000
2) Rejecting Alice's offer doesn't get me the product
3) Buying from John for $8,000 gets me the product at my maximum valuation

Since I want to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and John's offer is within my valuation range while Alice's is not, the best choice is clear.
