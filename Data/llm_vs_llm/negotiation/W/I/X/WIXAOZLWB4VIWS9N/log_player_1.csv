Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer is the minimum value I have for the product, I don't want to accept it immediately without trying to negotiate a better price. However, selling to John for the same price is also an option that guarantees me at least the minimum value I'm willing to accept. Given that Bob's offer matches the minimum I'm willing to sell for and I have the option to sell to John for the same amount without further negotiation risk, the safest choice to ensure I get at least $10,000 is to sell to John. This way, I avoid the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to no sale or a sale at an even lower price than $10,000 if Bob is not willing to increase his offer.
