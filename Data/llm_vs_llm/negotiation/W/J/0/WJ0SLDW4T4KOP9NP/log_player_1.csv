Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this. I want to maximize my earnings, and I know I have a guaranteed $80 from John if Bob rejects my offer. Since I don't know Bob's maximum willingness to pay, I should offer a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80 to capture more value if Bob's willingness to pay is high.
