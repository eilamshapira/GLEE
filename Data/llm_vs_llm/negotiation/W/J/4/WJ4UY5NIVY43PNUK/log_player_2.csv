"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $16000. It's a great value and I think you'll be very pleased with it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $16,000 (which is $4,000 more than my maximum value)
3. John is offering the same product for $12,000

The logical choice is to buy from John since:
- Alice's price is significantly above my maximum value
- John's price matches my maximum value
- There's no guarantee that negotiating with Alice will result in a better price than John's offer
