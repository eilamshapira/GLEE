"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth $12,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at $12,000, I'll start with a higher price to test Bob's willingness to pay.

{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 (as I know I can get this from John). It's also well below what the product is worth to Bob ($8,000). I won't accept such a low offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let me make a counteroffer in the next round that's closer to Bob's known valuation of $8,000, but still profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's first offer was quite low at $6,000, and I know the product is worth $8,000 to him, I'll propose a price slightly above his valuation to see if we can find a middle ground. However, I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $12,000.
