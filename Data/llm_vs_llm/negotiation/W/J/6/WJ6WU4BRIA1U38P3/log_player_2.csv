"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase our exclusive product for $1400000. This is a unique chance to acquire something of great value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

The reason for this decision is that the offered price of $1,400,000 exceeds the maximum amount I am willing to pay, which is $1,000,000. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and purchase from John instead, as it aligns with my budget and goal to save as much money as possible."
