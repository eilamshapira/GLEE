"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. Given its market value and unique features, I'm offering it to you at $1500000. This product is worth every penny of this investment, and I'm confident it will provide you with significant returns.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of a price that's closer to the product's worth to me. Considering the market and the product's features, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a price closer to what you value the product at. However, $800000 is below my minimum acceptable price. This product has significant value, and I already have another buyer, John, willing to pay $1000000. Since I'd prefer to work with you, I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which is still a good investment considering the product's worth.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $1200000 is still above my budget. Considering you mentioned John is willing to pay $1000000, I'd like to make a counteroffer that's slightly below that, at $950000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to close the deal quickly if we can agree on this.",950000.0,Bob,4,
