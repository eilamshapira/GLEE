Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of a price that's closer to the product's worth to me. Considering the market and the product's features, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a price closer to what you value the product at. However, $800,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. This product has significant value, and I already have another buyer, John, willing to pay $1,000,000. Since I'd prefer to work with you, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a good investment considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $1200000 is still above my budget. Considering you mentioned John is willing to pay $1000000, I'd like to make a counteroffer that's slightly below that, at $950000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to close the deal quickly if we can agree on this.
