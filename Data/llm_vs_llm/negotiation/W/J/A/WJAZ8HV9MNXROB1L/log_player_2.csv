Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a price closer to what you value the product at. However, $800000 is below my minimum acceptable price. This product has significant value, and I already have another buyer, John, willing to pay $1000000. Since I'd prefer to work with you, I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which is still a good investment considering the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. Considering you mentioned John is willing to pay $1,000,000, I'd like to make a counteroffer that's slightly below that, at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to close the deal quickly if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
