"Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I'd like to offer you. It's of high quality and comes with excellent features. I'm offering it to you for $14500. This is a competitive price considering the value this product will bring to you.",14500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $14500 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $8000 for the product, considering its features and my financial constraints. Let me know if this works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $8000 is the absolute minimum value of this product to me, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. Given the premium quality and features this product offers, I can come down to $12000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true market value of what you're getting.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price to $12000, but it's still a bit out of my budget. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $9000. This is the highest I can go while still considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $9000. I can see you're interested in the product, which I appreciate. However, I need to be transparent that the product's value and quality justify a higher price point. Given your budget constraints and to move us closer to an agreement, I can reduce my asking price to $10500. This is a very competitive offer considering the product's features and durability. I hope we can find common ground at this price.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway. However, $10500 is still slightly above what I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $9500, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let me know if this works for you.",9500.0,Bob,6,
