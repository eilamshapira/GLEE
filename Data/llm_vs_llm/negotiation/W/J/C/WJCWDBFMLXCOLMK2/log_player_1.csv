Round 2
Bob's offer:

While I understand budget constraints, $8,000 is the absolute minimum value of this product to me, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount.

This price better reflects the true market value of what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 12000}"

I hope we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
