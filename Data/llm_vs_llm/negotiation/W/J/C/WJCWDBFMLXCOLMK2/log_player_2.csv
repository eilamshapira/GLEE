Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $8000 is the absolute minimum value of this product to me, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. Given the premium quality and features this product offers, I can come down to $12000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true market value of what you're getting.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $9000. I can see you're interested in the product, which I appreciate. However, I need to be transparent that the product's value and quality justify a higher price point. Given your budget constraints and to move us closer to an agreement, I can reduce my asking price to $10500. This is a very competitive offer considering the product's features and durability. I hope we can find common ground at this price.
