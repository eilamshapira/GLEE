"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $13000 is significantly above my budget. I need to be transparent - this product is worth no more than $10000 to me, and I have another seller offering it at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $9500? This would help me justify choosing you over the other seller.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your transparency about the product's value to you and the competing offer. I appreciate your preference to do business with me. Considering your constraints, I'm willing to make a concession. However, I need to ensure a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $11500, which is still below its value to me but takes into account your budget and the competing offer.",11500.0,Alice,3,
