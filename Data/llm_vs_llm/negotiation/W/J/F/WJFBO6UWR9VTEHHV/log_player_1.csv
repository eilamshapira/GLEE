"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm pricing it at $13,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable addition."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $13000 is significantly above my budget. I need to be transparent - this product is worth no more than $10000 to me, and I have another seller offering it at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $9500? This would help me justify choosing you over the other seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, trying to find a middle ground that is closer to the product's value to me. Since Bob has another seller offering the product at $10,000, I will try to stay competitive while still aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your transparency about the product's value to you and the competing offer. I appreciate your preference to do business with me. Considering your constraints, I'm willing to make a concession. However, I need to ensure a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $11,500, which is still below its value to me but takes into account your budget and the competing offer."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
