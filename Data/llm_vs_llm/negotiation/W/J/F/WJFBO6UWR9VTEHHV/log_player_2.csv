"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm pricing it at $13000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable addition. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer: $13,000
2. My maximum value: $10,000
3. John's fixed price: $10,000
4. Alice's cost: $12,000

Alice's initial offer of $13,000 is significantly above both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000). Since Alice's cost is $12,000, there might be room for negotiation, but the initial offer is too high. However, since we have multiple rounds, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first to potentially get a better deal than John's price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that acknowledges Alice's position but also clearly states my constraints.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $13,000 is significantly above my budget. I need to be transparent - this product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and I have another seller offering it at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $9,500? This would help me justify choosing you over the other seller."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your transparency about the product's value to you and the competing offer. I appreciate your preference to do business with me. Considering your constraints, I'm willing to make a concession. However, I need to ensure a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $11500, which is still below its value to me but takes into account your budget and the competing offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Let's analyze the updated situation:

1. Alice's new offer: $11,500 (down from $13,000)
2. My maximum value: $10,000
3. John's fixed price: $10,000
4. Alice's cost: $12,000

While Alice has made a significant reduction from her initial offer ($1,500 less), the price of $11,500 is still:
- Above my maximum value ($10,000)
- Above John's price ($10,000)
- Below Alice's cost ($12,000)

Even though Alice is showing willingness to negotiate, this price is still not acceptable as it's above both my maximum value and the alternative option from John. There's no reason to accept a price higher than what I can get elsewhere, especially when it's also above my maximum value.

Given that Alice is already offering below her cost ($12,000), it seems unlikely she'll be able to match or beat John's price of $10,000. At this point, it makes the most sense to take John's offer.
