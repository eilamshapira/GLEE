"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $25000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10000 at this time.  Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $10000 is below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle? I'll come down to $22000.",22000.0,Alice,3,
