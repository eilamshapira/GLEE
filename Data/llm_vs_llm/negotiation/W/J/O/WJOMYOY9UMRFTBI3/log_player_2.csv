"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: Pay $150
2. Reject Alice's offer and look elsewhere
3. Buy from John: Pay $100

Since:
- The product is worth no more than $100 to me
- Alice's offer ($150) is significantly higher than my maximum value ($100)
- John is offering a guaranteed price of $100
- $100 is the maximum I value this product

The logical choice is to buy from John for $100. This way I get the product at my maximum valuation price, and I save $50 compared to Alice's offer.
