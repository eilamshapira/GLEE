"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth $15,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at $15,000, I'll start with a high initial offer to Bob to test the waters, while knowing I can always fall back on John's offer.

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $5,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even below his own valuation of $8,000. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, there's no reason to accept such a low offer or continue negotiating when Bob is starting so low.
