"Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a great fit for you. It's a high-quality item with excellent features that I know will provide significant value. I'm offering it to you for $14000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value of $15000 to you, giving you $1000 in surplus value. I could sell it to another buyer for $12000, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity since I believe this will be mutually beneficial. Would you like to proceed with this purchase?",14000.0,Alice,1,
