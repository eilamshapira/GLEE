"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a great fit for you. It's a high-quality item with excellent features that I know will provide significant value. I'm offering it to you for $14000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value of $15000 to you, giving you $1000 in surplus value. I could sell it to another buyer for $12000, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity since I believe this will be mutually beneficial. Would you like to proceed with this purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
