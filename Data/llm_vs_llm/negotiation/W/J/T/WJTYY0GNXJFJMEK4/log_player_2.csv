"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000 and also higher than John's guaranteed price. It would be better to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better price from Alice, knowing I always have John's $800,000 offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 600000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $600,000, which is below John's price of $800,000. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to John's offer. If Alice rejects this and comes back with a very high counteroffer, I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,500,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's guaranteed price ($800,000). While Alice has reduced her price from the initial $2,000,000, it's still not competitive with John's offer. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. If Alice doesn't come down to a more reasonable price soon, I can always take John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

I'll increase my offer to $700,000, which is still below John's price of $800,000 but shows movement toward a compromise. This gives Alice a signal that I'm willing to negotiate upward while still maintaining room for potential savings compared to John's offer. If Alice continues to counter with prices well above $800,000, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I've decided to buy from John for $800,000. Here's why:
1. Alice started at $2M, then $1.5M, and now $1.2M, but she's still significantly above my maximum value of $800,000
2. While Alice is showing willingness to reduce the price, the rate of reduction suggests it would take several more rounds to get anywhere near $800,000, if at all
3. Given that I have a guaranteed option at $800,000 from John, and that's my maximum value anyway, it makes more sense to take the sure deal rather than continue negotiating
4. There's a risk of running out of rounds while trying to negotiate with Alice, and her offers have consistently remained well above my target price"
