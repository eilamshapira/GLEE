Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while still being somewhat reasonable given Bob's maximum value of $15,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's counteroffer of $14,000 is actually quite good - it's much higher than John's fixed price of $12,000, and only $500 less than my initial offer. Given that Bob's maximum value is $15,000, this is probably close to the best price I can realistically get. If I try to push for more, I risk Bob walking away, leaving me with only John's $12,000 offer. I'll accept this offer.
