"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $12000. Let me know if you'd like to proceed!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $12000 is significantly above my budget. I should mention that I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer you $6500 for the product. What do you think?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the product's value justifies a higher price. Given your interest and my willingness to work with you, I can lower my offer to $10000. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10000 is still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, John is offering the same product for $8000, which is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer $7200. This is less than John's price but saves me the hassle of working with a different seller. Does that work for you?",7200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your situation and your desire to work with me. I can see that you're trying to stay within your budget. Given that, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8500? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my interest in closing the deal with you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $8500, which shows you're serious about making this deal work. However, I need to be transparent - the product is worth exactly $8000 to me, which happens to be John's asking price. I'd really prefer to do business with you, but I can't justify paying more than what the product is worth to me. My final offer is $7800 - slightly below John's price to give me an incentive to choose you as my seller. If we can't reach an agreement at this price point, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer.",7800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position and the value you place on the product. Given that you're willing to pay slightly less than John's offer to work with me, I'm willing to come down to $8000. This matches John's price and shows my commitment to making this deal work with you. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,7,
