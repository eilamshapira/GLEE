Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $12000 is significantly above my budget. I should mention that I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer you $6500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the product's value justifies a higher price. Given your interest and my willingness to work with you, I can lower my offer to $10,000. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10000 is still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, John is offering the same product for $8000, which is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer $7200. This is less than John's price but saves me the hassle of working with a different seller. Does that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your situation and your desire to work with me. I can see that you're trying to stay within your budget. Given that, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,500?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $8500, which shows you're serious about making this deal work. However, I need to be transparent - the product is worth exactly $8000 to me, which happens to be John's asking price. I'd really prefer to do business with you, but I can't justify paying more than what the product is worth to me. My final offer is $7800 - slightly below John's price to give me an incentive to choose you as my seller. If we can't reach an agreement at this price point, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:

Round 7
