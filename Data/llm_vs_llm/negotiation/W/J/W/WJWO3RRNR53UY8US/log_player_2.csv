"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $12000. Let me know if you'd like to proceed! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is more than the $8,000 it's worth to me, and also more than John's offer of $8,000, I should either negotiate with Alice or simply buy from John.

Since John is offering exactly what the product is worth to me ($8,000), there's no advantage in accepting Alice's current offer. I should try to negotiate with Alice first to see if I can get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is significantly above my budget. I should mention that I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $8,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer you $6,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 6500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the product's value justifies a higher price. Given your interest and my willingness to work with you, I can lower my offer to $10000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her price from $12,000 to $10,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still $2,000 more than John's offer of $8,000, and still above what the product is worth to me.

Since John is offering the product at exactly what it's worth to me ($8,000), there's no reason to pay more than that. I'll reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating to see if she'll go lower.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, John is offering the same product for $8,000, which is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer $7,200. This is less than John's price but saves me the hassle of working with a different seller. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 7200}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your situation and your desire to work with me. I can see that you're trying to stay within your budget. Given that, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8500? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my interest in closing the deal with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has come down to $8,500, which is getting closer to John's price of $8,000. However, since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and John is offering it at exactly $8,000, it doesn't make financial sense to pay $8,500.

At this point, I'll make one more attempt to negotiate with Alice to see if she'll match or beat John's price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $8,500, which shows you're serious about making this deal work. However, I need to be transparent - the product is worth exactly $8,000 to me, which happens to be John's asking price. I'd really prefer to do business with you, but I can't justify paying more than what the product is worth to me. My final offer is $7,800 - slightly below John's price to give me an incentive to choose you as my seller. If we can't reach an agreement at this price point, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 7800}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position and the value you place on the product. Given that you're willing to pay slightly less than John's offer to work with me, I'm willing to come down to $8000. This matches John's price and shows my commitment to making this deal work with you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has now offered to match John's price at $8,000, which is exactly what the product is worth to me. Since both sellers are now offering the same price, and I've established a negotiation relationship with Alice, I'll accept her offer.
