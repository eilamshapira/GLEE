"Thanks for offering, Alice! That product seems interesting, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $100 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice. It's a nice product, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  Could you do $110? That's a fair compromise, I think.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, $110 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I can't go too much lower. How about $120? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",120.0,Alice,5,
