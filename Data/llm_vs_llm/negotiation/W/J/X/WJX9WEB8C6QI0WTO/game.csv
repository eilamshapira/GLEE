"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique and valuable asset. I believe it holds immense potential for you. Given its rarity and the benefits it offers, I'm initially pricing it at $2500000. Let me know your thoughts.",2500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I would be interested in purchasing it for $800000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $800000 is far below my minimum acceptable price. While I am willing to negotiate, I believe a more realistic price reflecting the product's true value would be $2300000.",2300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product holds a certain value, but so does my time.  $2300000 is still considerably more than I'm comfortable spending. To move this forward, I'm willing to offer $1000000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, reflecting my serious interest. ",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious, and I appreciate the increased offer. We're still quite a ways apart, but I am willing to come down further. My bottom line, considering the inherent value and potential, is $2100000. This is a substantial reduction and I believe a fair price.",2100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we've both made concessions, but the gap is still quite large.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000.  However, I need to be realistic.  I'm not prepared to go much higher than this.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. Given that, I am willing to make another significant move. How about $1900000? This is getting close to my absolute minimum acceptable price, and I genuinely think it's a mutually beneficial deal.",1900000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down further. Let's make this simple: I'm prepared to offer you $1150000. This is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",1150000.0,Bob,8,
