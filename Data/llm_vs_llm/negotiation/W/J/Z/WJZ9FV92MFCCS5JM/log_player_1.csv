Send your offer to Bob.,"Based on the information given, I need to find a price to offer Bob that maximizes my expected profit.

Since I know the product is worth at least $80 to me (and I can definitely sell it to John for $80 if Bob rejects), I need to offer Bob a price above $80.

Without knowing Bob's valuation, I need to balance between:
1) Setting a high price to maximize profit if Bob accepts
2) Not setting it so high that Bob is likely to reject it

A reasonable approach would be to offer a moderately high price that gives me a good profit margin while still being potentially acceptable to Bob.
