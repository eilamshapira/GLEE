"Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product to me. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $100. I think this is a fair price considering the market value.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 might be a stretch for you. However, $100 is too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $160. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $160. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",110.0,Bob,4,
