"Alice, that price is way too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $800000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll gain from owning it.  Let's find a middle ground and make this deal happen.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has value, but $1250000 is still too high for me. I can go up to $900000. Let me know if that works for you.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to reach an agreement. $900000 is still too far below my minimum, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering you the product for $1100000. This is my final offer. If you don't accept, I'll have to consider selling to John instead.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I sense your frustration, and I appreciate you working with me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950000.  However, that's the best I can do. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still far from what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm going to counter with $1050000.  This is my final offer, and it's the closest I can come to meeting your needs.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
