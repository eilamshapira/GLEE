"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. Given its unique value, I'm offering it at $2,200,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high initially to establish a strong anchor point and leave room for negotiation.
* **Confident Tone:**  Projecting confidence in the product's value can influence Bob's perception.
* **Leaving Space:** The large difference between my asking price and Bob's perceived value allows for negotiation while staying well above my minimum.
 
It's important to note that while I have a backup offer from John, my goal is to maximize profit. I believe I can potentially get a price higher than John's offer from Bob with strategic negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price point that is more aligned with my budget. I'm willing to offer $500000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```
**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget considerations. However, your offer is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the unique benefits and potential it holds for your business."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  I'm making a substantial reduction from my initial offer to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to negotiate more seriously.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm reiterating the product's unique value to justify the still-high price point and counter Bob's lowball offer.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will give me a better understanding of how much Bob is actually willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value it holds, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $600000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob increased his offer slightly, it's still far below both my minimum and his own perceived value of the product. Continuing negotiation is the best strategy to maximize profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitancy, but I want to assure you that this product has the potential to significantly benefit your business.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Addressing Hesitancy:** I'm acknowledging Bob's low offers might be due to hesitation rather than a lack of interest.
* **Strong Value Proposition:**  I'm reinforcing the potential benefits of the product, reminding Bob why he was interested in the first place.
* **Strategic Price Drop:**  I'm making another significant drop in price, but remaining well above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value to encourage a more serious counteroffer. 

I'm aiming to create a sense of urgency and make Bob realize that I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of devaluing my product significantly."
