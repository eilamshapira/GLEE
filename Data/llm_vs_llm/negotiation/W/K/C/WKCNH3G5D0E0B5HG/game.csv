"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept $8000 as it's below my minimum threshold. However, I'm willing to be flexible from my initial price. Given the product's value, I can offer it to you for $17000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth.",17000.0,Alice,3,
