"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be valuable to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $20,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and potential value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your valuation but given my budget constraints, I can offer you $8000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and since I have John's guaranteed offer of $10,000, there's no reason to accept a lower amount. I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, but slightly lower than my initial offer to show flexibility in negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept $8,000 as it's below my minimum threshold. However, I'm willing to be flexible from my initial price. Given the product's value, I can offer it to you for $17,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. How about $9500? I feel this is a fair offer considering my budget and the alternative options available to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below John's guaranteed offer of $10,000, and Bob's incremental increases suggest he may not be willing to go much higher, it's most profitable to take John's certain offer of $10,000 rather than continue negotiating with Bob."
