"Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its exceptional quality and rarity, I'm offering it to you for $30000.",30000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the perceived value, $30000 is considerably outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $5000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price, considering I can always purchase a similar product elsewhere for $10000.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but I can't accept $5000. Considering the effort and resources I've put into this product, I'm willing to come down from my initial offer. How about $27500?",27500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $27500 is still too high.  I'm increasing my offer to $7500.  This is a significant jump, and I feel it's a reasonable compromise.  I'd like to remind you my alternative is purchasing a comparable product for $10000, so let's try to find a middle ground.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I still can't accept $7500. I'm willing to make another compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $25000. This is my final offer.",25000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the movement, $25000 is still significantly more than I'm willing to spend.  Your characterization of that as 'meeting in the middle' seems a bit disingenuous. I'm willing to move to $9000. This is a serious offer, and itâ€™s getting very close to my alternative purchase price.  If we can't agree on a price soon, I'll have to go with the other option.",9000.0,Bob,6,
