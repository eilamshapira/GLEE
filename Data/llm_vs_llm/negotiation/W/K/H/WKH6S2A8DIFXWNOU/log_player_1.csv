"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its exceptional quality and rarity, I'm offering it to you for $30,000."", ""product_price"": 30000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the perceived value, $30000 is considerably outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $5000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price, considering I can always purchase a similar product elsewhere for $10000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Okay, Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. Considering I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but I can't accept $5,000. Considering the effort and resources I've put into this product, I'm willing to come down from my initial offer. How about $27,500?"", ""product_price"": 27500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $27500 is still too high.  I'm increasing my offer to $7500.  This is a significant jump, and I feel it's a reasonable compromise.  I'd like to remind you my alternative is purchasing a comparable product for $10000, so let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is still too low. While he's increased his offer, it's nowhere near what I'm aiming for. I'm also keeping in mind that I can sell to John for $15,000. I'll reject and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer. I need to show that I'm willing to negotiate, but I also need to protect my bottom line.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I still can't accept $7,500. I'm willing to make another compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $25,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the movement, $25000 is still significantly more than I'm willing to spend.  Your characterization of that as 'meeting in the middle' seems a bit disingenuous. I'm willing to move to $9000. This is a serious offer, and itâ€™s getting very close to my alternative purchase price.  If we can't agree on a price soon, I'll have to go with the other option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is still too low. I'm now at a critical point. The offers are not getting close to my minimum of $15,000, so I will sell to John.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
