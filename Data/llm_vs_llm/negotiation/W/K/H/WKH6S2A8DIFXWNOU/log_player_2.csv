Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the movement, $25,000 is still significantly more than I'm willing to spend.  Your characterization of that as 'meeting in the middle' seems a bit disingenuous. I'm willing to move to $9,000. This is a serious offer, and itâ€™s getting very close to my alternative purchase price.  If we can't agree on a price soon, I'll have to go with the other option."", ""product_price"": 9000}
