"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I understand that you believe the product is valuable, but $2300000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. Let's discuss further.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However, $800000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1900000. This reflects the value I place on the product while still acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1900000 is still a bit steep for me. Considering your initial offer and my previous counteroffer, I'd like to propose a price of $1000000. This price reflects a compromise between our two positions, and I believe it's a fair value for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about reaching a deal, and I respect that. While $1000000 is still under what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This feels like a significant concession on my part, reflecting a strong desire to find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your concession to $1600000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product, which is an increase from my previous offer. I believe this price is more reasonable, and I'm hoping we can meet at this point.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I can sense we're both motivated to close this deal. To meet you halfway, I propose a final offer of $1350000.  This price takes into account everything we've both shared. Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
