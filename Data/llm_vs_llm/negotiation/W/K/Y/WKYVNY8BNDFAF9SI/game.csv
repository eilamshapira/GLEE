"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I've compared prices and can actually get the same product from another seller for $120. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if we can agree on a better price. Would you consider $90? This would save me some money and still give you a sale you might otherwise lose.",90.0,Bob,2,
