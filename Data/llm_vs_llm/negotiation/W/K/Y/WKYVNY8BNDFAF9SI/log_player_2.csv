"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $120. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice is offering the product at $120, which is the same price as I can get it from John. She's also setting the price at the maximum value that the product is worth to me. Given this initial offer, I should try to negotiate for a better price, as there's potential for Alice to reduce her price. If the negotiation doesn't work out, I can always buy from John at $120.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I've compared prices and can actually get the same product from another seller for $120. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if we can agree on a better price. Would you consider $90? This would save me some money and still give you a sale you might otherwise lose."", ""product_price"": 90}"
