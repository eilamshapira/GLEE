Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $600,000, which is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, I have to reject the offer.

Therefore, my decision is:

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my desired price while still trying to negotiate.

```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a tough spot. $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but the negotiations aren't going well. I need to carefully consider my options. I could continue to negotiate, but the risk of Bob offering even less or walking away altogether is increasing. Selling to John guarantees me $1,200,000.

Considering the potential loss and the guaranteed profit from John, I will choose the safe option and end the negotiation with Bob to sell the product to John.

Therefore, my decision is:

```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```"
