Send your offer to Bob.,"I understand my role as Alice in this negotiation scenario. I'm selling a product that's worth at least $12,000 to me, and Bob values it at $12,000. I have a fallback option of selling to John for $12,000.

Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, that's likely his maximum willingness to pay. I'll start with a slightly higher offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so high that it immediately ends the conversation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000, I need to reject it and continue negotiating."
