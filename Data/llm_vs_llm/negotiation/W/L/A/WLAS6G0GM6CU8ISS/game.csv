"Alice, your offer is very generous, but I'm only able to go up to $1200000 at this time. This is a fair price considering my own valuation and the potential savings for you compared to selling to John.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, I'm afraid $1200000 is not something I can accept. However, I am willing to come down on my price a bit. How about $1600000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1600000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $1300000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away with a satisfactory deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position. This is my final offer. I'm willing to meet you closer to your valuation, but given the product's worth to me and its unique nature, I can't go below $1550000. This is my absolute bottom line.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
