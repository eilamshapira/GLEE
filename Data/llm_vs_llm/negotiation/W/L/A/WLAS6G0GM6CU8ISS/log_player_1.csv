Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to acquire this unique product. Considering its exceptional value and rarity, I'm offering it to you for $1,700,000."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is very generous, but I'm only able to go up to $1200000 at this time. This is a fair price considering my own valuation and the potential savings for you compared to selling to John.
