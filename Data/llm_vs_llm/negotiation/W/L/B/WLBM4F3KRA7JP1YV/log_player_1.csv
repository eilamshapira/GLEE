Let's find a middle ground. How about:

{""product_price"": 2000000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000}

I understand that we might have different valuations for the product. However, I believe that this price is fair and reflects the value and quality of the product. I am open to further negotiation, but I would appreciate it if you could provide a counteroffer that is closer to my asking price. Thank you for your understanding."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I appreciate your interest in my product, but it seems that we are too far apart in our valuations. I have decided to sell the product to another buyer who has offered me $1,500,000. Thank you for your time and consideration. Goodbye.
I would be open to doing business with you in the future if you require similar products."
