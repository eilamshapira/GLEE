"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer is significantly higher than my maximum value ($120) and higher than John's price. It makes sense to reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I value the product at $120 and that's also John's price, I'll start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 80}

This counteroffer is reasonable because:
1. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $200
2. It gives room for negotiation upward while still potentially saving money compared to John's price
3. If Alice rejects, we can still gradually increase our offer in subsequent rounds while keeping the option to go to John if needed"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer because:
1. $180 is still well above my maximum value of $120
2. It's also significantly higher than John's price of $120
3. While Alice has reduced her price from $200 to $180 (a $20 reduction), it's still not close to an acceptable range
4. We still have several rounds left to negotiate, and Alice has shown willingness to reduce the price
5. We always have the option to go to John for $120 if negotiations don't progress favorably"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down $20 from her initial offer, I'll increase my previous offer by a similar amount to show willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price well below John's price.

{""product_price"": 100}

This counteroffer is strategic because:
1. It's a $20 increase from my previous offer of $80, showing I'm willing to meet in the middle
2. It's still below John's price of $120, giving me room to potentially save money
3. It maintains room for further negotiation while showing good faith
4. If Alice rejects, we still have several rounds left and can continue negotiating or fall back to John's offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer because:
1. $160 is still above both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120)
2. Alice has shown a pattern of reducing her price ($200 -> $180 -> $160), so there might be room for further negotiation
3. There are still several rounds left to negotiate
4. If the negotiations don't work out, we can still buy from John at $120
5. The $40 reduction from Alice's last offer shows significant movement, suggesting she might be willing to reduce further"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has reduced her price by $20 each time (from $200 to $180 to $160), I'll increase my offer similarly from my last offer of $100.

{""product_price"": 110}

This counteroffer is strategic because:
1. It's a $10 increase from my previous offer, continuing to show willingness to negotiate
2. It's still below John's price of $120, maintaining potential for savings
3. The smaller increment ($10 instead of $20) signals we're getting closer to my maximum price
4. It's close enough to John's price that Alice might realize she needs to make a more competitive offer
5. If Alice rejects, we still have the option to go to John or continue negotiating"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll buy from John because:
1. Alice's latest offer ($155) is still significantly above John's price ($120)
2. Alice's price reductions are getting smaller ($160 to $155 is only $5), suggesting she's unlikely to drop the price below $120
3. Even if Alice continues to reduce her price at this rate, we would run out of rounds before reaching $120
4. Since $120 is my maximum value for the product, there's no reason to pay more than that
5. John's price gives me the best guaranteed outcome without further negotiation risk"
