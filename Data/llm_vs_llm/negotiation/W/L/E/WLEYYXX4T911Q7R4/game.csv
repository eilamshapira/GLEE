"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this excellent product for $16000.  I know it's a significant investment, but it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $16000 is far more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to offer you $8000 for the product, which is my absolute top price.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8000 is considerably lower than its value.  I could come down to $14000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this quality.  What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $14000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my original offer of $8000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can agree on.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  Let's split the difference between my last offer and yours. How about $11000?  This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it's a fair price.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for both of us.  However, $11000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9500.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving a bit. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is my final offer.  Itâ€™s a great deal for a product of this quality, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere.",10500.0,Alice,7,
