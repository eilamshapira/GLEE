Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8000 is considerably lower than its value.  I could come down to $14000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this quality.  What do you say?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  Let's split the difference between my last offer and yours. How about $11000?  This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it's a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

I'm getting tired of this back and forth, and I'm not sure Alice will budge any further.  I'm going to buy from John instead."
