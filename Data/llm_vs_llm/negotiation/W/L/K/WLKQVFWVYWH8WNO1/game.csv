"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a similar price point. However, I value our conversation and believe you'd truly benefit from this product. So, I'm willing to make one final concession. I can let it go for $1450000. This is my best and final offer, Bob.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
