Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800000 is significantly below the product's value. Given the quality and potential of this product, I can offer it to you for $1100000, which is already a substantial reduction from my initial price. This represents a fair value for both parties.
