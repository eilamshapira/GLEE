Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob
2. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me
3. If Bob rejects, I can sell to John for $1,000,000
4. Bob will accept if the price is less than or equal to $1,200,000

To maximize my profit while ensuring a high likelihood of acceptance, I should price it just slightly below Bob's valuation. This way, Bob still gets a small surplus while I maximize my earnings.
