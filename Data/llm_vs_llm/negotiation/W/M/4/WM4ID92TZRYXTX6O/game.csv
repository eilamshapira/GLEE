"Alice, your product sounds intriguing, but $2200000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000, which is my maximum.  If you're open to negotiating, I'm ready to discuss further.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $800000 is significantly below the product's value. I can offer it to you for $1800000, which is already a substantial reduction from my initial price. This better reflects the true value of the product while still providing you with a fair deal. Would you consider this price?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, but $1800000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1000000. This represents a significant investment for me and a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
