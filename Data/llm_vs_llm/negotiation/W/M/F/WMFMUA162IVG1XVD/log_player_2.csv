"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this unique product at $150. Let me know if you're interested in buying it at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer of $150 is higher than both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100), it wouldn't be rational to accept this offer. Between the remaining options, I could try to negotiate with Alice by rejecting and making a counteroffer, but since John's price ($100) is already at my maximum value, there's no guarantee Alice would go below that price. The safe and rational choice is to buy from John.
