"Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $8,000
2. John's price is $8,000
3. The product is worth $8,000 to me

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($8,000), and this price equals the maximum value I'm willing to pay, I am indifferent between the two sellers. There's no financial advantage in choosing one over the other.

In this case, I might as well accept Alice's offer since she's already here with the product, rather than going through the process of finding and dealing with John.
