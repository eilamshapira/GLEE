Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $10,000 to Bob
2. The product is worth at least $12,000 to me
3. I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000
4. Bob will reject any offer above $10,000 (his maximum value)
5. I shouldn't sell for less than $12,000 (my minimum value)

Since Bob's maximum value ($10,000) is less than my minimum acceptable price ($12,000), there is no price point where we can make a deal that benefits both parties. Any offer I make to Bob should be high enough to ensure I can proceed with selling to John.
