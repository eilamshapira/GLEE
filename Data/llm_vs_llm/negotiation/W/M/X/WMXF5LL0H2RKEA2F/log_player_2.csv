"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer ($13,000) is higher than both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000), it wouldn't be rational to accept Alice's offer. The best option is to buy from John at $10,000, which matches my maximum value and saves me $3,000 compared to Alice's offer.
