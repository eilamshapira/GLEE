"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will bring you significant value. After careful consideration, I'm willing to let it go for a price of $14000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. I look forward to hearing back from you.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $14000 seems quite high considering market conditions. Given that I have other options available, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11500. This still provides you with a healthy profit margin, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. I'm looking forward to your response.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must say that $11500 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value. I'm willing to make a compromise and meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I'd like to propose a price of $12750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12750.0,Alice,3,
