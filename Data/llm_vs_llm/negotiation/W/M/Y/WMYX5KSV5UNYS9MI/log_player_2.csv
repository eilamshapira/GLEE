Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget considerations, I need to ensure I'm getting fair value for this product. The $900000 you offered is quite below what the product is worth on the market. I'm willing to come down from my initial price to $1100000, which I believe is still a great deal considering the $1500000 value this product will bring to your business. Let me know your thoughts on this revised offer.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your revised offer. I understand you have budget constraints, but I also need to consider the true market value of this product. Looking at our positions, I think we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm willing to lower my price to $1025000, which represents a significant discount from the $1500000 value you'll be getting from this product. This price allows both of us to benefit from this transaction fairly. I hope you'll find this acceptable.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your continued interest in finding a mutually agreeable price. I note your mention of a similar product from John at $1500000, which actually reinforces the excellent value I'm offering you. I appreciate your movement to $975000, and I'm also willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle at $1000000 - a clean, round number that represents a substantial $500000 discount from what you mentioned you'd pay elsewhere. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both and allows us to conclude our negotiation successfully. What do you say?
