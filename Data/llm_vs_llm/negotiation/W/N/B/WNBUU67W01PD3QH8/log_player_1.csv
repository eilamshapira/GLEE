Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the potential value of the product, $2500000 is significantly over my budget. I'm prepared to offer $500000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the information available to me.  I look forward to hearing your response.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I must decline your offer of $500,000. This product has significant value and $500,000 is well below what I can accept. My minimum acceptable price is $1,500,000, which represents the true baseline value of this product based on market analysis and its potential returns. I'm willing to negotiate from there, but I cannot go below this threshold as I have another buyer willing to purchase at this price. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for getting back to me. I understand you have other potential buyers, but $1900000 remains too high for me.  While I'm very interested in the product, I need to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $750000. This is a substantial increase and reflects my serious interest.  Let me know what you think.

While $750,000 shows your commitment, I need to be transparent that I have a standing offer of $1,500,000 from another buyer. Given the actual value and potential of this product, I can come down to $1,700,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price reflects both the market value and allows you room for future returns on your investment. I'm hoping we can bridge the gap and find a price that works for both of us, but I cannot go below my baseline of $1,500,000 due to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
