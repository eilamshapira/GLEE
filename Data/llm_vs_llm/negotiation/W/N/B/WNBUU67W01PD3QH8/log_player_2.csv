Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I must decline your offer of $500000. This product has significant value and $500000 is well below what I can accept. My minimum acceptable price is $1500000, which represents the true baseline value of this product based on market analysis and its potential returns. I'm willing to negotiate from there, but I cannot go below this threshold as I have another buyer willing to purchase at this price. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

While I'm very interested in the product, I need to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. This is a substantial increase and reflects my serious interest.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your interest in the product. While $750000 shows your commitment, I need to be transparent that I have a standing offer of $1500000 from another buyer. Given the actual value and potential of this product, I can come down to $1700000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price reflects both the market value and allows you room for future returns on your investment. I'm hoping we can bridge the gap and find a price that works for both of us, but I cannot go below my baseline of $1500000 due to my alternative option.
