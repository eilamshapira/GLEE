"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I need to make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice. She's asking for $2,000,000, which is twice what the product is worth to me and twice what John is offering. I'll start with a significantly lower offer to leave room for negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has now dropped her price to $1,000,000, which is the same as John's offer. Since I can't get it for any cheaper elsewhere (John is also selling for $1,000,000), and this price equals the maximum value of the product to me, I'll accept Alice's offer.
