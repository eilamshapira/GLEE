"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let's analyze the situation:

*   **Alice's Offer:** $14,000
*   **Your Value:** $15,000 (maximum you'd pay)
*   **Buying from John:** $15,000
*   **Your current profit if accepting the offer:** $15,000 (value) - $14,000 (price) = $1,000

Since the offered price ($14,000) is less than the value you have for the product ($15,000), you should consider accepting Alice's offer to maximize the benefit. However, you can also make a counteroffer to potentially lower the price further. However, there is no guarantee that your counteroffer will be accepted by Alice, which may lead to a risk. In addition, you will have to buy the product from John at the higher price ($15,000) if the negotiation fails.

Therefore, I choose to accept Alice's offer.
