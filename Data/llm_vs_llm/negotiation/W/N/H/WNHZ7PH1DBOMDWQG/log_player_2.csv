It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further. You can likely get a better price than $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial price and is still within the range of what you are willing to pay.  It should leave room for potential negotiation but also shows you are serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a good deal considering you are willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product.  Accepting this offer saves you $150,000 compared to buying from John."
