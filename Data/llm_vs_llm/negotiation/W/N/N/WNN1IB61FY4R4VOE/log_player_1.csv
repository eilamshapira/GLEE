Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $5000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob. Since his offer of $5,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer of $20,000, I'll try to find a middle ground that still reflects the product's value to me.

My counteroffer to Bob: $17,500. This price is closer to my initial offer but shows that I'm willing to negotiate."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still very far apart on price. While I appreciate you coming down a bit, I need to see a more significant move to continue this negotiation.  I'm willing to offer $7000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000.

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob. Since he's willing to increase his offer to $7,000, it shows that he's still interested in the product. I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my previous counteroffer.

My counteroffer to Bob: $12,250. This price is lower than my previous counteroffer but still reflects the product's value to me."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm starting to think we may not be able to agree on a price. I'm willing to go up to $7500, but that's my absolute limit.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Since Bob's absolute limit is $7,500, which is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I have the option to sell the product to John for $15,000, I think it's best to end the negotiation with Bob and sell the product to John. This ensures I get a price that meets my minimum requirement."
