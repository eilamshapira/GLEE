Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that I know the product is worth $800,000 to Bob and I have a guaranteed backup offer of $1,500,000 from John, I should start with a high offer to Bob. Even though Bob likely won't accept it, it gives room for negotiation while ensuring I don't go below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
