"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is a bit high for me. I can find similar products for around $120 elsewhere. Would you be willing to sell it for $100? This would make it more attractive for me to buy from you.",100.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your position, I cannot go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway though. How about $125? This is a good deal considering the value of the product.",125.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
