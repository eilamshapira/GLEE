Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is a bit high for me. I can find similar products for around $120 elsewhere. Would you be willing to sell it for $100? This would make it more attractive for me to buy from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your position, I cannot go as low as $100.
