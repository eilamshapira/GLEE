"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me think about this:
1. The product is worth $120 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $150, which is $30 more than my maximum value
3. John is willing to sell it for $120, which matches my maximum value
4. Even if I make a counteroffer to Alice, I know I can always fall back to John's offer

Since Alice's offer ($150) is higher than both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120), and I have a guaranteed option to buy from John, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably lower than Alice's initial offer but still gives room for negotiation:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is a bit high for me. I can find similar products for around $120 elsewhere. Would you be willing to sell it for $100? This would make it more attractive for me to buy from you."", ""product_price"": 100}

The logic behind my counteroffer:
1. I start significantly lower than Alice's $150 offer
2. I mention the market alternative ($120) to justify my position
3. I offer $100, which gives room for negotiation up to my maximum value of $120
4. If Alice rejects this, we can still negotiate upward, or I can ultimately go to John"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your position, I cannot go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway though. How about $125? This is a good deal considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this situation:
1. Alice has come down from $150 to $125, showing willingness to negotiate
2. However, $125 is still above John's price of $120
3. John's offer is guaranteed at $120, which is my maximum value
4. There's no reason to pay $5 more to Alice when I can get the same product from John for less

Since Alice's current offer ($125) is still higher than John's price ($120), and John's price already matches my maximum value, the most logical decision is to buy from John.
