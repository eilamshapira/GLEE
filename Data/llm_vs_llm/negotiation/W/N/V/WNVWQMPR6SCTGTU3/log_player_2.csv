"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Since Alice's offer is the maximum I'm willing to pay, there's no incentive to negotiate further. Buying from John guarantees the purchase at my price limit."
