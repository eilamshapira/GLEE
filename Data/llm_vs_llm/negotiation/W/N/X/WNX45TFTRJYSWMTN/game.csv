"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $13500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $11500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $11500 is still above what I'm willing to spend. How about we settle at $9500? I think this is a fair price considering my budget constraints.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. How about we settle at $10500?",10500.0,Alice,5,
