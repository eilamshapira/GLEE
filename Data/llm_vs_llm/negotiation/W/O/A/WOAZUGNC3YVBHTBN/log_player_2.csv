"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's initial offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay, and I have the option to buy the product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in accepting Alice's offer immediately. However, I also don't want to give up the potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of getting a better deal.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. This will give us room to negotiate and potentially find a mutually agreeable price.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $10,000 is more reasonable, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since I have 8 rounds left to negotiate, I'm willing to continue the negotiation to see if I can get an even lower price.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice's offer of $10,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I still want to try to get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous one, to show that I'm willing to compromise, but still lower than Alice's current offer.
