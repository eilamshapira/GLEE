Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $12,000 to Bob
2. I have a guaranteed fallback of $12,000 from John
3. Bob will only accept if the price is less than or equal to $12,000
4. Since I have a guaranteed $12,000 from John, there's no reason to offer less than $12,000 to Bob

Therefore, I'll offer Bob exactly $12,000, since:
- If he accepts, I get $12,000
- If he rejects, I still get $12,000 from John
- Offering more would lead to certain rejection
- Offering less would reduce my profit unnecessarily
