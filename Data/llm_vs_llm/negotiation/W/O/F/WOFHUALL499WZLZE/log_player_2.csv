"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer is the same as John's price ($1,500,000), and it's worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, I should reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price with Alice. There's no risk in trying to get a better deal since I can always fall back on John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low that it would be considered unreasonable.

{""product_price"": 1000000}

This offer is 2/3 of Alice's asking price, which gives room for negotiation while still being a substantial amount. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, this might create some tension but isn't insulting, and it gives us room to move up in future rounds if needed while still potentially saving a significant amount."
