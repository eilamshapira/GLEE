"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to offer you my product for $160. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice is offering to sell me the product for $160, which is above the $120 that it's worth to me. Given that I can buy the same product from John for exactly $120, accepting Alice's offer would not be a good decision.

Since John is offering the product at a price that matches its value to me ($120), and this is lower than Alice's offer, the rational choice would be to buy from John.
