I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good chunk of the potential value. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a bit low, but I'm not ready to settle yet.  I'll try a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still aiming for a price closer to the middle ground. Let's see if this is more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still below my target, but getting closer.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm making another small concession, but I'm still trying to get as close to my desired price as possible.  I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob."
