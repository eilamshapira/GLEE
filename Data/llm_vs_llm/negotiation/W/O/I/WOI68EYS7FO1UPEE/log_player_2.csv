"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $1,500,000
2. Alice's current offer is $1,200,000
3. I know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice
4. I have 10 rounds to negotiate
5. I can always fall back to John's offer of $1,500,000

Since Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly above her value ($800,000), there should be room for negotiation. Given that I have many rounds left and the current offer is well below my maximum value, it makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, I'll start with a price that's moderately above her cost but significantly lower than her initial offer. This gives room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for Alice.

{""product_price"": 900000}

This offer would give Alice a $100,000 profit while saving me a significant amount compared to both her initial offer ($1,200,000) and John's alternative ($1,500,000). If Alice rejects this, we still have room to negotiate upward in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice has lowered her price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. This is a $100,000 reduction from her initial offer
3. Her cost is $800,000, so she's still making a significant profit
4. We still have 7 rounds left for negotiation
5. The current offer is still well below John's price of $1,500,000

Since Alice has shown flexibility by reducing her price, but there's still substantial room between her cost ($800,000) and current offer ($1,100,000), it's worth continuing negotiations. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has moved down $100,000 from her initial offer, showing she's willing to negotiate. I'll increase my previous offer of $900,000, but still aim for a price that gives both parties a reasonable outcome.

{""product_price"": 950000}

This offer:
1. Is $50,000 higher than my previous offer, showing willingness to compromise
2. Would give Alice a $150,000 profit (from her $800,000 cost)
3. Is still significantly better for me than both Alice's last offer ($1,100,000) and John's price ($1,500,000)
4. Leaves room for further negotiation if needed, as we still have several rounds remaining"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let's analyze the latest development:

1. Alice has reduced her price again from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000
2. The pattern shows consistent decreases: $1,200,000 → $1,100,000 → $1,050,000
3. The gap between our positions is narrowing ($950,000 vs $1,050,000)
4. She's now offering a price that's $450,000 less than John's alternative
5. She's still making a $250,000 profit above her cost
6. We're halfway through our negotiation rounds

While we could continue negotiating, the risk of losing a good deal might outweigh the potential savings:
- Alice has shown consistent willingness to decrease price
- The current price is significantly better than our alternative with John
- We might risk Alice becoming frustrated and less flexible if we push too hard

Given these factors, I think it's prudent to accept this offer.
