"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

{""product_price"": 1,900,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $1,200,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and below what John is willing to pay. However, I'll continue negotiating with Bob since there are still several rounds left to potentially get a better price than John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer somewhat but still maintain a price well above John's guaranteed offer.

{""product_price"": 1,700,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. Since we're already in round 4 and Bob's increases in offers are relatively small ($100,000 increment from his last offer), it's unlikely we'll get Bob to exceed John's offer in the remaining rounds. The most prudent decision is to sell to John and secure the $1,500,000.
