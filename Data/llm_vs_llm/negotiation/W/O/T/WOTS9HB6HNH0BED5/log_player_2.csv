"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a special price of $8500. This is a great deal, as it's worth at least $8000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! If not, I'll be selling it to John for $8000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to make a decision that maximizes my value while staying within my constraints.

The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me. Alice is offering to sell it for $8,500, which is $500 more than my maximum valuation. Meanwhile, John is willing to sell me the same product for $8,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since Alice's offer exceeds what the product is worth to me, and I have a guaranteed alternative at a lower price that matches my valuation, the rational choice is clear.
