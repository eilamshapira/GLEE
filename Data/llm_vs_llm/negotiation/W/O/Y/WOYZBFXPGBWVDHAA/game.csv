"Bob, I'm excited to finally be able to offer you this incredible opportunity. I know you've been looking for something truly exceptional, and I believe this is it. Given its unique attributes and potential benefits for you, I'm offering it to you for $3000000.",3000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $3000000 is out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $600000, considering the product's value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $600000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle-ish? I can offer it to you for $2750000.",2750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2750000 is still quite high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $700000? I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700000 is still far below what I can accept. I'm truly trying to work with you here. Let's try this: I'll come down to $2500000. This is a significant reduction, and it's the lowest I can realistically go at this stage.",2500000.0,Alice,5,
