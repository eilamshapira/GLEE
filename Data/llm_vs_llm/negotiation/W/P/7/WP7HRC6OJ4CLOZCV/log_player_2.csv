"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is above my maximum budget of $800,000, it doesn't make sense for me to accept this offer. Additionally, buying from John for $800,000 is within my budget, but I'd like to try negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price that's lower than $1,200,000 but still beneficial for both parties. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is reasonable and within my budget. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a lower offer and see how Alice responds.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,000,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000. While it's a step in the right direction, I'm not willing to pay that much for the product. Since buying from John for $800,000 is still an option, I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer decreased by $200,000 from $1,200,000 to $1,000,000, I'll try to meet her halfway and make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous one.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $850,000 is very close to my maximum budget of $800,000, but still slightly above it. At this point, I have to consider whether the product is worth paying a premium for. However, since I can buy the same product from John for $800,000, which is within my budget, I don't see a compelling reason to pay more to Alice.
