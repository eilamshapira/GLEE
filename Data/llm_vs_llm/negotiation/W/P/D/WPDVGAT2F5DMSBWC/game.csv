"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand budget constraints can be a factor, but considering the value and quality of this product, I cannot go as low as $12000. I can however meet you partway and offer it at $13500, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. This is a fair price that reflects the true value of the product while also considering your budget.",13500.0,Alice,3,
