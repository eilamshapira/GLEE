"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to carefully consider the options:

1. Alice offers the product for $14,000
2. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
3. John will sell me the same product for $12,000

Since Alice's offer ($14,000) exceeds both the product's value to me and John's alternative price, the logical choice is to buy from John to save $2,000.
