"Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional quality and the value it can bring to you, I'm confident that a price of $1450000 is more than reasonable. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1450000 is significantly higher than what I'm prepared to pay for this product. Given current market conditions and my budget constraints, I can offer $1000000. This is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, given your budget constraints, I'm willing to make a concession. I believe $1350000 is a fair price that reflects the product's value and your budget. This offer demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $1350000 is still beyond what I can justify for this product. I can increase my offer to $1100000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer. This represents a substantial portion of my budget and reflects my serious interest in doing business with you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that we're both trying to find a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make another concession. I believe that $1250000 is a very competitive price that reflects your budget constraints and the value of the product. This is a significant step down from my initial offer. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I can see you're making a real effort to reach an agreement. However, I need to be transparent - I have another vendor offering the same product for $1200000. To make it worth choosing you over them, I would need a better price. I can offer $1150000, which would still be more profitable for you than losing the sale entirely.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
