Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1450000 is significantly higher than what I'm prepared to pay for this product. Given current market conditions and my budget constraints, I can offer $1000000. This is a fair starting point for our negotiation.

# Message to Bob:
Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, $1,000,000 is significantly lower than the value the product brings to the table. I understand the need to consider market conditions and budget constraints, but I believe we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price reflects the product's quality and the benefits it will bring to you. What do you think?"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $1350000 is still beyond what I can justify for this product.

Bob, thank you for coming up on your offer. I see that you're making a significant effort to meet me in the middle, and I appreciate that. However, $1,100,000 is still too low for me to accept.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I can see you're making a real effort to reach an agreement. However, I need to be transparent - I have another vendor offering the same product for $1200000. To make it worth choosing you over them, I would need a better price. I can offer $1150000, which would still be more profitable for you than losing the sale entirely.
