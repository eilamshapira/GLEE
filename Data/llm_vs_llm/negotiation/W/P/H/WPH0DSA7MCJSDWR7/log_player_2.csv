"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional quality and the value it can bring to you, I'm confident that a price of $1450000 is more than reasonable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","The offer of $1,450,000 is well above both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's alternative price ($1,200,000). There's no reason to accept this offer, and since I have the option to negotiate further, I should reject and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than my maximum value but leaves some room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,450,000 is significantly higher than what I'm prepared to pay for this product. Given current market conditions and my budget constraints, I can offer $1,000,000. This is a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, given your budget constraints, I'm willing to make a concession. I believe $1350000 is a fair price that reflects the product's value and your budget. This offer demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","While Alice has reduced the price, $1,350,000 is still above both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's alternative price ($1,200,000). Since there's still a guaranteed option to buy from John at $1,200,000, and we still have several rounds of negotiation possible, I should reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer but still keep it below John's price to maintain room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $1,350,000 is still beyond what I can justify for this product. I can increase my offer to $1,100,000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer. This represents a substantial portion of my budget and reflects my serious interest in doing business with you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're both trying to find a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make another concession. I believe that $1250000 is a very competitive price that reflects your budget constraints and the value of the product. This is a significant step down from my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has come down significantly to $1,250,000, but this is still $50,000 more than John's guaranteed price of $1,200,000. Since I know I can get the same product from John for less, and Alice's offer is still above my maximum value, it makes sense to reject this offer and continue negotiating. However, if we can't reach a better deal soon, I should consider taking John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has shown willingness to negotiate and has come down significantly. I'll make one more serious attempt at reaching a deal below John's price.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I can see you're making a real effort to reach an agreement. However, I need to be transparent - I have another vendor offering the same product for $1,200,000. To make it worth choosing you over them, I would need a better price. I can offer $1,150,000, which would still be more profitable for you than losing the sale entirely."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
