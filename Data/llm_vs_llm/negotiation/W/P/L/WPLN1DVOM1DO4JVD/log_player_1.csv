Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm offering you the product for $100. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice! Thanks for your offer, but $100 is a bit high for me. Since I know I can get this product elsewhere for $80, I'd like to offer you $70 for it. This would give us both a good deal - you'd make a quick sale, and I'd save some money. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
