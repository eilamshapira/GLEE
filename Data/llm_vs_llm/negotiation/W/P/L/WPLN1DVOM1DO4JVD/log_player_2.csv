"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm offering you the product for $100. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price of $100 is above both my maximum value ($80) and John's alternative price ($80). It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer to Alice, since there's potential to get a better price than John's $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice! Thanks for your offer, but $100 is a bit high for me. Since I know I can get this product elsewhere for $80, I'd like to offer you $70 for it. This would give us both a good deal - you'd make a quick sale, and I'd save some money. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 70}"
