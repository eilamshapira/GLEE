Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product today for $150. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, I'm not willing to pay $150. I'll reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's reasonable, considering I can buy the product from John for $100. I'll offer $80, which is lower than my maximum budget, to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $80. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 80}"
