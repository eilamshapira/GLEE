"Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Based on my assessment, this product is worth $10000 in value to you. I'm offering it to you at $9500, which gives you $500 in value while allowing me to make a reasonable profit on the sale. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it represents a better deal than I would get from my other potential buyer. Would you be interested in this offer?",9500.0,Alice,1,
