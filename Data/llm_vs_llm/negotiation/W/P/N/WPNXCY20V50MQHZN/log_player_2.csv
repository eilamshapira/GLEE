"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Based on my assessment, this product is worth $10000 in value to you. I'm offering it to you at $9500, which gives you $500 in value while allowing me to make a reasonable profit on the sale. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it represents a better deal than I would get from my other potential buyer. Would you be interested in this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Value:** Alice values the product at $8,000.
* **Your Value:** You value the product at $10,000.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $9,500.
* **Alternative:** You can buy from John for $10,000.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can still buy the product from John for $10,000, which is closer to your perceived value. While you would save $500 by accepting Alice's offer, it's not a significant enough savings to justify selling below your own perceived value. You can likely negotiate a better price with John or find another seller."
