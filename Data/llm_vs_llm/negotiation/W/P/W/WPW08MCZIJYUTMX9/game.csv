"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. How about we settle on $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a fair price for the product. Let's try to find a middle ground.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $150 is still a bit high for me. How about we try $110? This is closer to my budget and still gives you a good return on the product.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid to $110. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $120 for the product. Let's try to meet in the middle of our last two offers.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $130 is still above what I'm willing to pay. Since you mentioned $120 as your minimum, how about we settle on that? It's a fair price and within my budget.",120.0,Bob,6,
