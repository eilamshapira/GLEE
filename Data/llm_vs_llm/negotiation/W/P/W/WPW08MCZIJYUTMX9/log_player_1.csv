Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. How about we settle on $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $100 because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a fair price for the product. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $150 is still a bit high for me. How about we try $110? This is closer to my budget and still gives you a good return on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $110 because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Since Bob is getting closer to my target price, I'll make another counteroffer to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid to $110. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $120 for the product. Let's try to meet in the middle of our last two offers."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $130 is still above what I'm willing to pay. Since you mentioned $120 as your minimum, how about we settle on that? It's a fair price and within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

I accept Bob's offer of $120. Since this is my minimum acceptable price and Bob is now willing to meet it, I don't see a need to continue negotiating or risk losing the sale by trying to hold out for a higher price. Additionally, selling to Bob at this price is equivalent to selling to John, but it allows me to complete the transaction with Bob, which might be preferable for building a relationship or avoiding any potential hassle of switching to a different buyer."
