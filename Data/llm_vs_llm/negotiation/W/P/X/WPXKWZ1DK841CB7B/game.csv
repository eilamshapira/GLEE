,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",60.0,Bob,2,
"I'm sorry Bob, but I can't go that low. I think we can meet somewhere in the middle. Let's try this: I'll offer it to you for $160.",160.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $160, but it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your new price. How about $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
"Okay Bob, I'm getting closer to your price. How about we settle at $125?",125.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer

"Hi Alice, we're getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable with $125. I'm willing to go up a bit more, but I have to stay within my budget. How about $100?",100.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $112 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to make one final offer of $105, and if we can't agree on that, I'll have to consider other options.",105.0,Bob,8,
