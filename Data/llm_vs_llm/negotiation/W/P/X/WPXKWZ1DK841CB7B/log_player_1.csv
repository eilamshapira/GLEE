Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd really be interested in. How about I offer it to you for $175?"", ""product_price"": 175}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Okay, $60 is way too low. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""I'm sorry Bob, but I can't go that low. I think we can meet somewhere in the middle. Let's try this: I'll offer it to you for $160."", ""product_price"": 160}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $160, but it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your new price. How about $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","This is getting closer. $110 is a lot better than $60. It's above my minimum of $100. I think I can get a bit more, but I also don't want to risk losing the sale entirely. I'll make a small counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Okay Bob, I'm getting closer to your price. How about we settle at $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, we're getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable with $125. I'm willing to go up a bit more, but I have to stay within my budget. How about $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","This is a tough decision. Bob is offering $100. I know John will buy it for $100, so I'm not losing money. However, I suspect Bob might be willing to pay a bit more. I could push it, but I also don't want to lose the sale entirely. Since I'm at my minimum, I think it's worth the risk to try one last counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time, how about $112?"", ""product_price"": 112}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $112 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to make one final offer of $105, and if we can't agree on that, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Okay, $105 is very tempting. It's more than the $100 I'm guaranteed from John. I could push it further, but Bob seems firm, and I've already pushed him several times. I think I'll take the deal.
