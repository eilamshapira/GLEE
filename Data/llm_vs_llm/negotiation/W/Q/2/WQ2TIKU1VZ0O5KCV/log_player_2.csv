"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Given that Alice's offer is $14,000, and my maximum valuation is $15,000, I can try to negotiate for a better price. Since Alice's cost is $10,000, there's room for negotiation. Paying $14,000 is better than John's price of $15,000, but I can try to get a better deal by making a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's cost is $10,000 and my maximum value is $15,000, I'll start with a reasonable counteroffer that's significantly lower than her initial $14,000 but still above her cost. I'll offer $11,500, which gives room for negotiation while still allowing profit for Alice.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has lowered her price from $14,000 to $13,500, showing she's willing to negotiate. While this is better than John's price of $15,000, there's still room for negotiation since her cost is $10,000. I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down $500 from her initial offer, I'll move up from my previous offer of $11,500. I'll propose $12,000, which is still giving her a good profit margin while being significantly better for me than her current offer of $13,500.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has shown a pattern of decreasing her price by $500 each time ($14,000 → $13,500 → $13,000). The current offer of $13,000 is $2,000 less than my maximum value of $15,000 and is significantly better than John's price. While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might become frustrated and stop decreasing her price. Given that she's already offered a reasonable price that gives me a good savings, I'll accept this offer.
