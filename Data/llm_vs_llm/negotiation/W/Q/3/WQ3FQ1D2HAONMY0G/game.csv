"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it at $150. This is a fair price considering the value it provides. Would you like to purchase it?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot go as low as $80. The product's value and quality justify a higher price. However, I can reduce my initial offer to $120, which is a fair compromise. Would this work for you?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $120 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your new offer. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
