Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it at $150. This is a fair price considering the value it provides. Would you like to purchase it?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer. I can try to negotiate with Bob for a better price than John's $100, but I won't go below $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot go as low as $80. The product's value and quality justify a higher price. However, I can reduce my initial offer to $120, which is a fair compromise. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $120 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your new offer. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob is only willing to pay $100, which is the same price John is offering, it makes more sense to sell to John right away. There's no indication that Bob will increase his offer above $100, and continuing the negotiation might just waste time when I can get the same price from John immediately."
