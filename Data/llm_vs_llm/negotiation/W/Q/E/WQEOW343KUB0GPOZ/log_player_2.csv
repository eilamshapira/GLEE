"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I have a fantastic offer for you. I'm willing to let go of my premium product for a bargain price of $1450000. This is a steal considering its market value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is lower than the product's value to her, it's still more than you want to pay. You can get a better deal from John for $1,200,000."
