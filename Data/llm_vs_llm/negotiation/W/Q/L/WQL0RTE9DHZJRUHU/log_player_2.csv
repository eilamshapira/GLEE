"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have an amazing product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me
2. Alice is offering the product for $200
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $100
4. My goal is to save money while getting the product

Alice's offer ($200) is clearly higher than both:
- The value I place on the product ($100)
- John's alternative offer ($100)

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer since it's twice the price I can get from John, and twice what the product is worth to me.
