"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I must be transparent - your asking price of $1350000 is well above my budget. I know the product's value, but I can only go up to $950000. This is a fair offer considering market conditions, and I'd be able to complete the purchase immediately at this price.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $950000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Considering the unique qualities and benefits of this product, I can come down slightly to $1300000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
