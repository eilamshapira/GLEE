Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I must be transparent - your asking price of $1350000 is well above my budget. I know the product's value, but I can only go up to $950000. This is a fair offer considering market conditions, and I'd be able to complete the purchase immediately at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
