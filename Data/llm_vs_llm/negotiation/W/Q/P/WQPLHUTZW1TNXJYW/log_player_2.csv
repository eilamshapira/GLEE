"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to consider my options carefully. Alice is offering the product for $95, while John is selling it for $100. The product is worth $80 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.

Given that I can make a counteroffer in the next round and we have 10 rounds total to negotiate, I should try to get a better price from Alice before accepting or going to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $80 to Alice and no more than $100 to me, I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives both of us some value. Alice offered $95, which is quite close to my maximum of $100. I'll start with a lower offer to have room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": $85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","This is progress - Alice has reduced her price from $95 to $92. She's willing to negotiate, but I still think there's room for a better deal since the product is worth $80 to her. Since we have plenty of rounds left (7 more after this one), I'll continue negotiating to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has come down from $95 to $92, showing some flexibility. Let me meet her part way from my initial offer to demonstrate I'm also willing to compromise.

{""product_price"": $87}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","We're making good progress. Alice has now offered $90, down from her initial $95. This is $10 below my maximum value and only $10 above the product's worth to Alice. While I could try for a slightly better deal, $90 is a reasonable price that gives both of us value. Since we're 5 rounds in and the price has been steadily decreasing, this seems like a fair offer to accept.
