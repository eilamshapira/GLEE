"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is outside my budget range. I would be willing to purchase the product for $700000. Please let me know if you can work with that.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob, but $700000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand budget constraints, but I need to ensure a fair return on this valuable product. I can offer it to you for $1800000, which is already a reduction from my initial price.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
