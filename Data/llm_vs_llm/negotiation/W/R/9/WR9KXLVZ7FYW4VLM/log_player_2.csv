"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer ($2,400,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,500,000) and John's price ($1,500,000), it would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. The best option would be to buy from John.
