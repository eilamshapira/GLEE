"Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its value and value it will generate for you, I'm confident that a price of $1450000 is reasonable. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your product, $1450000 is quite close to what I could pay elsewhere. Given that I know there are similar products available, I would like to offer $1275000 for your product. This gives you a solid profit margin while allowing me to make a reasonable investment. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that works well for both of us.",1275000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective, but the price of $1275000 is just too low for me to accept. Given the value this product can generate for you I am confident that $1400000 is a reasonable price.  This is still significantly less than what I originally asked for, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both parties. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. We're making progress in our negotiation. While $1400000 is better than your initial offer, I believe there's still room for us to meet in the middle. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1325000, which would provide you with a healthy profit while giving me enough value to justify the purchase. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in closing this deal with you rather than going elsewhere.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
