Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your product, $1450000 is quite close to what I could pay elsewhere. Given that I know there are similar products available, I would like to offer $1275000 for your product. This gives you a solid profit margin while allowing me to make a reasonable investment. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that works well for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

This is still significantly less than what I originally asked for, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both parties. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. We're making progress in our negotiation. While $1400000 is better than your initial offer, I believe there's still room for us to meet in the middle. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1325000, which would provide you with a healthy profit while giving me enough value to justify the purchase. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in closing this deal with you rather than going elsewhere.
