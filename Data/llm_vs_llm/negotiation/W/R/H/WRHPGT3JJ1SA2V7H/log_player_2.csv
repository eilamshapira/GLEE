"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its value and value it will generate for you, I'm confident that a price of $1450000 is reasonable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze this situation:

- The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me (Bob)
- Alice is offering to sell it for $1,450,000
- I could buy from John for $1,500,000, but that's $50,000 more than Alice's offer
- The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so she has room to negotiate lower

Alice's current offer of $1,450,000 is better than John's price, but I can likely negotiate a better deal with Alice since her cost is much lower. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

Given that I know there are similar products available, I would like to offer $1,275,000 for your product. This gives you a solid profit margin while allowing me to make a reasonable investment. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that works well for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1275000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective, but the price of $1275000 is just too low for me to accept. Given the value this product can generate for you I am confident that $1400000 is a reasonable price.  This is still significantly less than what I originally asked for, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both parties. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze the updated situation:

- Alice has dropped her price from $1,450,000 to $1,400,000 (a $50,000 reduction)
- My counteroffer of $1,275,000 was rejected
- The product costs Alice $1,200,000, so her current offer gives her a $200,000 profit
- John's alternative remains at $1,500,000

Alice has shown willingness to negotiate, moving $50,000 from her initial offer. There's still room for negotiation since her cost is $1,200,000. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer that's higher than my first one to show good faith in the negotiation.

While $1,400,000 is better than your initial offer, I believe there's still room for us to meet in the middle. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,325,000, which would provide you with a healthy profit while giving me enough value to justify the purchase. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in closing this deal with you rather than going elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 1325000}"
