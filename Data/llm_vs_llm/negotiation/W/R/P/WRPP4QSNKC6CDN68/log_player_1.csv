Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $11,500. It's a great product and I think you'll find it very valuable. Are you interested in this price?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11500 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $10500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Message: ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better deal. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11,000?"""
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, after considering your offer, I'm willing to lower my price to $11,000. This is a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $11000 is still a bit high for me. Could you go down to $10750? I think that would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"":""AcceptOffer""}

Message: ""Hi Bob, you've got a deal. I accept your offer of $10,750.""

It's better to sell the product now to Bob for $10,750 instead of risking a lower price or having to sell it to John for only $10,000."
