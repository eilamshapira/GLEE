"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since the product is only worth $150 to me and John is willing to sell it at that price, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $200. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to negotiate a better price. If we can't reach an agreement below $150, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 120}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $120. This gives some room for negotiation while still being below my maximum value of $150. If Alice rejects this and counters with a price above $150, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $180 is still above my maximum value of $150, and it's also higher than John's guaranteed price. There's no reason to accept this offer. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round. If we can't reach an agreement below $150, I still have John's offer as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 130}

I'll increase my previous offer slightly to $130. This shows some willingness to negotiate while still staying well below my maximum value of $150. It's also below John's price, which gives Alice an incentive to consider it if she wants to make the sale. If Alice still doesn't accept, I can either continue negotiating or take John's offer of $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John for $150. Here's why:
1. Alice's current offer ($165) is still above my maximum value of $150
2. Alice's offers have come down slowly (from $200 to $180 to $165), suggesting she might not be willing to go below $150
3. We've already used half of our negotiation rounds
4. John's offer of $150 exactly matches my maximum value
5. There's no guarantee that continued negotiation with Alice will result in a better price than John's

Rather than risk more rounds of negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome, it's most rational to take the guaranteed option of buying from John at $150."
