"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd really like. I'm offering it to you for $200."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I can only go up to $60 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Considering Bob's offer of $60, which is significantly below my minimum of $120, I'm not willing to accept it. I need to hold out for a better price.

Therefore, I will **Reject Bob's offer** and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand your budget, but $60 is too low. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it for $160."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I have to stick closer to my budget. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer of $70 is still far too low. I'm losing money at that price. I need to make a choice here. I could continue to negotiate, but the risk of ending up with an even lower offer or no sale at all is significant.

I will **Sell the product to John for $120.** This guarantees I make a profit and at least get a fair price.
