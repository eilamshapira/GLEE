Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to offer a price to Bob that would maximize my earnings from selling this product. I know the product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price if Bob rejects my offer.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll set a price that gives me a good chance of earning more than my guaranteed $15,000, while not being so high that Bob is likely to reject it outright.
