"Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $22,500, which is more than I'm willing to pay, I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $10,000.
