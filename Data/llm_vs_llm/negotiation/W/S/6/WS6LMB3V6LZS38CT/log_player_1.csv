Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested in purchasing it, but the price of $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700000, considering the market value and my budget. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to negotiate further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. I have another buyer, John, who is ready to pay $1,200,000, which reflects the product's true market value. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. My counteroffer is $1,400,000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price better reflects the product's quality and potential return on investment."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your counteroffer of $1400000. I understand that you have another buyer willing to pay $1200000, but I'm still not comfortable with a price that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your counteroffer. I'd like to propose a price of $1000000. This price takes into account the product's value and my budget, and I believe it's a fair compromise.
