Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $700000 is significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. I have another buyer, John, who is ready to pay $1200000, which reflects the product's true market value. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. My counteroffer is $1400000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price better reflects the product's quality and potential return on investment.
