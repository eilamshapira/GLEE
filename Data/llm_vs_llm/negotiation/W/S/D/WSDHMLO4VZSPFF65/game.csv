"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me right now. I'm really looking to stay within a budget, and I value this product at $900000. Would you consider that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but I must decline. At $900000, you're offering less than what I have from another interested buyer. Given the product's value and considering your budget constraints, I can reduce my initial ask to $1200000. This is a significant reduction from my first offer and better reflects current market conditions while still acknowledging the product's true worth. Would you consider this revised price?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand, and appreciate you coming down on the price. However, my budget is still a concern. I'm willing to go up to $950000, which I believe is a fair price given my evaluation of the product. What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,4,
