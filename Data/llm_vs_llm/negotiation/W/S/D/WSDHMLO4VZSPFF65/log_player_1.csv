"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique and valuable product that I know would be perfect for you. Given its exceptional value and market position, I'm offering it at $1,400,000. This price reflects the product's true worth and potential. Would you be interested in proceeding with this offer?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me right now. I'm really looking to stay within a budget, and I value this product at $900000. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. $900,000 is below even the minimum value I can accept, and it's less than what John is willing to pay. I'll continue negotiating with Bob to try to reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but I must decline. At $900,000, you're offering less than what I have from another interested buyer. Given the product's value and considering your budget constraints, I can reduce my initial ask to $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my first offer and better reflects current market conditions while still acknowledging the product's true worth. Would you consider this revised price?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand, and appreciate you coming down on the price. However, my budget is still a concern. I'm willing to go up to $950000, which I believe is a fair price given my evaluation of the product. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offers are consistently below John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer, and we've already gone through several rounds without significant movement toward a higher price, it makes the most financial sense to accept John's offer. This ensures I receive at least $1,000,000 for the product, which is better than Bob's current offer of $950,000."
