"Hello Bob, I have a quality product available for sale. Given its excellent condition and market value, I'm offering it to you for $16000. I believe this is a fair price for such a valuable item.",16000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out, but $16000 is significantly higher than what I can pay for this product. The market value for similar items is much lower, and I know I can purchase the same product elsewhere for $8000. However, I value the opportunity to do business with you, so I'm willing to offer $6500. This gives you a reasonable profit while staying within my budget constraints.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I cannot accept $6500 as it's well below my cost. While I understand your budget constraints, $8000 is already below the actual market value of this product. I need to be clear that my absolute minimum is $12000, which is what I could sell it for immediately to another interested buyer. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $14000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $14000 is still well above my budget and the product's value to me. I understand you mentioned $12000 as your absolute minimum, but I need to be honest that this product is worth no more than $8000 to me. I also have another seller offering the same product at exactly $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find common ground. To demonstrate my commitment, I can offer $7500, which is close to what I can pay elsewhere but gives you the benefit of closing the deal now rather than me going to the other seller.",7500.0,Bob,4,
