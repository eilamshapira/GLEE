Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a quality product available for sale. Given its excellent condition and market value, I'm offering it to you for $16,000. I believe this is a fair price for such a valuable item."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out, but $16000 is significantly higher than what I can pay for this product. The market value for similar items is much lower, and I know I can purchase the same product elsewhere for $8000. However, I value the opportunity to do business with you, so I'm willing to offer $6500. This gives you a reasonable profit while staying within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I cannot accept $6,500 as it's well below my cost. While I understand your budget constraints, $8,000 is already below the actual market value of this product. I need to be clear that my absolute minimum is $12,000, which is what I could sell it for immediately to another interested buyer. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $14,000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $14000 is still well above my budget and the product's value to me. I understand you mentioned $12000 as your absolute minimum, but I need to be honest that this product is worth no more than $8000 to me. I also have another seller offering the same product at exactly $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find common ground. To demonstrate my commitment, I can offer $7500, which is close to what I can pay elsewhere but gives you the benefit of closing the deal now rather than me going to the other seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
