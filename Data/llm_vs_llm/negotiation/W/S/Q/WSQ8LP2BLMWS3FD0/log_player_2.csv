"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a quality product available for sale. Given its excellent condition and market value, I'm offering it to you for $16000. I believe this is a fair price for such a valuable item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'll analyze this offer carefully:

1) Alice is offering the product for $16,000
2) The product is worth at most $8,000 to me
3) I can buy the same product from John for $8,000 anytime

Alice's current offer of $16,000 is double what the product is worth to me and double what I can get it for elsewhere. There's no reason to accept this offer.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out, but $16,000 is significantly higher than what I can pay for this product. The market value for similar items is much lower, and I know I can purchase the same product elsewhere for $8,000. However, I value the opportunity to do business with you, so I'm willing to offer $6,500. This gives you a reasonable profit while staying within my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 6500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I cannot accept $6500 as it's well below my cost. While I understand your budget constraints, $8000 is already below the actual market value of this product. I need to be clear that my absolute minimum is $12000, which is what I could sell it for immediately to another interested buyer. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $14000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'll analyze this updated offer:

1) Alice has reduced her price to $14,000 from $16,000
2) Alice claims her minimum is $12,000
3) The product is worth at most $8,000 to me
4) I can buy the same product from John for $8,000 anytime

Even after the reduction, Alice's offer of $14,000 is still significantly higher than what the product is worth to me and higher than what I can get it for elsewhere. There's no reason to accept this offer.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $14,000 is still well above my budget and the product's value to me. I understand you mentioned $12,000 as your absolute minimum, but I need to be honest that this product is worth no more than $8,000 to me. I also have another seller offering the same product at exactly $8,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find common ground. To demonstrate my commitment, I can offer $7,500, which is close to what I can pay elsewhere but gives you the benefit of closing the deal now rather than me going to the other seller."", ""product_price"": 7500}"
