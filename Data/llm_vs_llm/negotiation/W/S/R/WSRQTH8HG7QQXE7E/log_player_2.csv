"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'll analyze the situation:
1. Alice's offer is $140
2. The product is worth $120 to me
3. John is willing to sell it for $120
4. I have 10 rounds for negotiation

Since Alice's offer ($140) is above both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120), there's no reason to accept it. While I could try negotiating with Alice, I already know I can get it for $120 from John, which is my maximum value anyway. There's no potential to save more money by negotiating.
