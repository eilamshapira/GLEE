"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12000 is more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is a bit lower. Would you consider $8000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! However, I can't go as low as $8000. How about we meet in the middle? Iâ€™ll offer you the product for $10500. Let me know your thoughts!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks Alice, but $10500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to negotiate, how about $9000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response! While I appreciate your offer of $9000, I can't accept that just yet. How about we settle at $10000? That's truly the lowest I'm willing to go. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,5,
