"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20000 is significantly above my budget. My maximum is $5000. Would you consider selling it for that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $5,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually agreeable price."
