"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer significantly below John's price to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to be unreasonable.

{""product_price"": 900000}

This offer is substantially below John's price of $1,200,000, giving room for negotiation while still being a serious offer. If Alice rejects this, we can gradually work our way up, knowing we always have John's offer as a backup."
