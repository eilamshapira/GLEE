"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $20000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is $10000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, the lowest I can go on this product is $18000 given its value and quality. Let me know if this works for you.",18000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer

"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $18000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm willing to lower the price further, but $14000 is still below what I can accept. How about we settle at $16000? This is my final offer before considering other buyers.",16000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. I can go down to $16000, which is my final offer before I need to consider other buyers. Let me know if this works for you.",16000.0,Alice,5,
