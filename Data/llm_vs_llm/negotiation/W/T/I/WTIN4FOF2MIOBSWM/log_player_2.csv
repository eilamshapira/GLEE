"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of significant value to you. I'm offering it at $25000, which I believe is a fair market price given its quality and features. This is an exclusive opportunity, as I already have another buyer, John, who is prepared to purchase it at $15000. However, I wanted to give you the first opportunity to acquire this product if you see its value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}"
