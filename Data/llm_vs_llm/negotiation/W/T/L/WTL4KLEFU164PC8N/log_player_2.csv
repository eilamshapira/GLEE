"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let me think through this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me.
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $15,000.
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $8,000.

Since Alice's offer ($15,000) is significantly higher than both the product's value to me and John's price, the rational decision is to buy from John instead.
