"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I need to make an offer for my product that is worth at least $1,200,000 to me. I should recognize that Bob values it at $800,000, which means there's a significant gap between our valuations. Since I have a guaranteed backup option to sell to John for $1,200,000, I shouldn't accept anything below that amount. I'll start with a high offer to leave room for potential negotiation.

{""product_price"": $1,500,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to evaluate this carefully. Bob has offered $600,000, which is significantly below my minimum value of $1,200,000. This amount is even less than what Bob himself values the product at ($800,000), so he's starting with a very low offer. Since I have a guaranteed option to sell to John for $1,200,000, and Bob's offer is far below that, the best decision is clear.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob offered significantly below my minimum acceptable value, I need to make it clear that my price will not go below $1,200,000, as I have that guaranteed from John. However, I'll still leave some room for a small negotiation while being firm about my bottom line.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob has only increased his offer from $600,000 to $650,000, which is still far below my minimum value of $1,200,000. He doesn't seem to be making substantial movement toward a price that would be acceptable to me. Since I have John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000, and Bob's current offer is only 54% of that value, I should reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I need to be clearer with Bob about my bottom line. He's making very small increases in his offers, which suggests he may not understand that I have a guaranteed alternative of $1,200,000 from John. I'll reduce my price slightly to show some flexibility, but also make it clear that I cannot go below my minimum threshold.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob is still making incremental offers that remain far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. His new offer of $700,000 is still only 58% of what John is willing to pay. Bob has increased his offer by only $100,000 over three rounds, which suggests he's not moving toward a price that would work for me. With only 4 rounds remaining after this one, and such a large gap to bridge, it's unlikely we'll reach an agreement that beats John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I need to be very direct with Bob now. We've gone through several rounds, and he's still offering far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll make one final attempt to clearly communicate my bottom line before considering ending the negotiation and taking John's offer.

{""product_price"": $1,200,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer of $750,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. He's only increased his offer by $50,000 this round, showing he's not making substantial movement toward my clearly stated bottom line. We now have only 2 rounds left after this one, and there's still a $450,000 gap between his offer and my minimum price. Given this situation and the guaranteed alternative I have with John, it makes the most sense to sell to John.
