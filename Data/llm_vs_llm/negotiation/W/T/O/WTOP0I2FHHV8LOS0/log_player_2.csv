"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I believe it will be a valuable addition for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I'm interested, $200 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $80?"", ""product_price"": 80} 

**Reasoning:** Starting significantly lower leaves room for negotiation.  It's unlikely Alice's minimum acceptable price is already at your target. This offer tests the waters without being offensively low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'd be happy to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $175. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice reducing her price only slightly suggests she might be holding on to a higher valuation.  It's still too far from an acceptable price, so continuing negotiation is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $175 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $100? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 100}

**Reasoning:**  
* We've established Alice's initial offer wasn't a strong anchor.
* $100 is a significant jump from $80, showing willingness to move but keeping us well below John's price.
* Framing it as ""fair"" appeals to a sense of deal-making rather than pure price haggling."
