"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save a bit more. How about $125 for the product?",125.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, I understand you want to save a bit, but $125 is a bit lower than I can go at this point. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're looking for a good deal. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $140? It's a slight decrease from my last offer, but still reflects the value of the product.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for working with me, Alice. How about meeting closer to my range at $130? I believe itâ€™s a reasonable offer.",130.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. However, $130 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Let's try $137. It's closer to your offer but still within my acceptable range.",137.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer. How about we settle at $136? It's a small step down from my last offer but should be more in line with what you're looking for.",136.0,Alice,5,
