"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product for $950000. I believe it could bring great value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $950,000
2. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
3. John is offering the same product for $800,000

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000). There's no reason to accept this offer or make a counteroffer when I can get the same product from John at a better price that matches my maximum value.
