"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I notice that Alice is offering the product at $1,000,000, which is actually $200,000 more than what the product is worth to me (my maximum budget of $800,000). It's also more expensive than John's guaranteed offer of $800,000.

Since Alice's offer exceeds both my maximum value for the product and the alternative option from John, it makes no sense for me to accept it.

I could reject and make a counteroffer to Alice, but since John is already offering exactly at my maximum value point, there's no reason to negotiate further with Alice unless I believe she would accept significantly less than $800,000.
