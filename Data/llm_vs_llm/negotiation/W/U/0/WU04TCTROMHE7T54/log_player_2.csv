"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $1200000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something that will add significant value to your portfolio. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  Even though Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above your target of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiating is the best option:** You should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price with her. If she won't budge, you can always fall back to John's offer."
