"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider a lower price, closer to  $700000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to make an offer. However, $700000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I can offer it to you for $950000.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While that offer is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $800000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise on the price. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. Considering we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price, I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I can offer the product to you for $920000. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",920000.0,Alice,5,
