Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will bring significant value to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider a lower price, closer to  $700000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $1,000,000, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to make an offer. However, $700,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While that offer is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $800000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Although Bob's offer of $800,000 is closer to a fair price, I still have the option to sell the product to John for $1,000,000, which is $200,000 more than Bob's offer. I will try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round, but if it doesn't work out, I can always fall back on John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise on the price. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. Considering we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price, I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I can offer the product to you for $920,000. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 920000}"
