"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, and Alice is offering it for $200, I should reject her offer. Then, I will buy the product from John for $80, which is within my acceptable price range.
