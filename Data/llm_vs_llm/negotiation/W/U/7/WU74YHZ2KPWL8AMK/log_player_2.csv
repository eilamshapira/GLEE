"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Looking at Alice's offer, she is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is exactly the same price that John is offering. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, so it makes no difference financially whether I buy from Alice or John.

Since both offers are identical at $1,200,000, I might as well accept Alice's offer as it's the same as what I would pay to John.
