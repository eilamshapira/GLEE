"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this exclusive product at a special price of $15000. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since the price Alice is offering ($15,000) is higher than my maximum value ($12,000), I should reject the offer. I'm better off buying from John for $12,000.
