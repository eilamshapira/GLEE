"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's offer ($150) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80), it wouldn't be rational to accept Alice's offer. John's price matches my maximum value and is much lower than Alice's offer.
