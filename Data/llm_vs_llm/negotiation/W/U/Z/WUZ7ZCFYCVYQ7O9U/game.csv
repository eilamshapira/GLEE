"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $120 is a bit high for me. Given that similar products are available in the market, I'd like to propose $105, which I believe is a fair price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $105. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'd like to propose a price of $115. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know if this works for you!",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. While $115 is better, I still feel it's a bit high. I can increase my offer to $108, which gives you a good margin while being more in line with my budget. How does that sound?",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $108. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. After considering your new offer, I'd like to propose a price of $112. This is a slight reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider!",112.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate how we're working together to find a fair price. Your offer of $112 is getting closer, and I can see you're trying to meet me partway. I can come up to $110, which I think would be a fair deal for both of us. This gives you a good profit margin while still being a reasonable price for me. Would you accept this as our final price?",110.0,Bob,6,
