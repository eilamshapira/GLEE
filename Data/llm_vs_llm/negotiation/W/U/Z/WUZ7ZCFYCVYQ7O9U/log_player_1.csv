Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $120 is a bit high for me. Given that similar products are available in the market, I'd like to propose $105, which I believe is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to counteroffer since $105 is close to my target, but I believe I can get a better price. I'll send a new offer to Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $105. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'd like to propose a price of $115. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know if this works for you!"", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. While $115 is better, I still feel it's a bit high. I can increase my offer to $108, which gives you a good margin while being more in line with my budget. How does that sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to counteroffer again since $108 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'll try to meet Bob halfway again and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. I'll send a new offer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $108. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. After considering your new offer, I'd like to propose a price of $112. This is a slight reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider!"", ""product_price"": 112}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate how we're working together to find a fair price. Your offer of $112 is getting closer, and I can see you're trying to meet me partway. I can come up to $110, which I think would be a fair deal for both of us. This gives you a good profit margin while still being a reasonable price for me. Would you accept this as our final price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

I think $110 is a reasonable price, and Bob has been willing to negotiate and increase his offer. Since the product is worth $120 to him, I'm getting a good deal, and it's close to my initial target. Accepting this offer seems like the best option, as it ensures a sale and a good profit margin."
