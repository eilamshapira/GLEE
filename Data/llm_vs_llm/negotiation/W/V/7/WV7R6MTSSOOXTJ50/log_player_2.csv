Let's start by aiming significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and see how she responds. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below John's price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is getting closer to John's price, but there's still room for negotiation. It's worth making another counteroffer before settling for John's price."

This counteroffer splits the difference between her last offer and ours, showing willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly lower than John's."
