"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2000000. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm open to negotiations.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the unique value of your product, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, which I believe is still a fair price given its potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a price that reflects the product's true worth. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $1800000, which is still a significant reduction from my initial price.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1800000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $1200000 for the product, as I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its value and my budget. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're making progress. Your offer of $1200000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I still believe the product is worth more. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current one. Let's discuss a price of $1500000, which I think is a fair compromise.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1500000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1300000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my last offer and shows my commitment to reaching a deal. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to reach a deal. Your offer of $1300000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I still think we can find a better middle ground. I'm willing to come down from my previous offer to $1400000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget constraints.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting very close!  $1400000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price. However, to show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1350000.  Let's make this happen!",1350000.0,Bob,8,
