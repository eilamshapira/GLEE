"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. My initial offer is $1400000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, I believe your initial price is a bit high. I'm willing to offer $1150000, which would provide you with a fair profit margin while being more aligned with my budget. This represents a reasonable middle ground for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $1150000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It's significantly more valuable than that.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000. It's a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice. To show my good faith in reaching a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1225000. This represents a fair profit margin for you while being more reasonable for my budget. I believe this is a balanced proposition that works well for both of us.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1225000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1262500.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to close the deal.",1262500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility and suggestion to split the difference. In the spirit of reaching an agreement, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1245000. This represents another step from my side toward meeting in the middle, providing you with a substantial profit while still being reasonable for my budget. I believe we're getting very close to finding our sweet spot.",1245000.0,Bob,6,
