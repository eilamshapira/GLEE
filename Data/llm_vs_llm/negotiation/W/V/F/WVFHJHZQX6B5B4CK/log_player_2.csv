"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. My initial offer is $1400000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's offer is $1,400,000
2. John's fixed price is $1,500,000
3. The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me
4. The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice
5. I have 10 rounds to negotiate

Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000 is lower than John's price ($1,500,000), but it's still quite high considering Alice's value is $1,000,000. Since this is just the first round and I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, I should try to get a better price from Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice's cost is $1,000,000 and she offered $1,400,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower but still provides her with a reasonable profit. I'll propose $1,150,000, which would give her a $150,000 profit while saving me a significant amount compared to both her initial offer and John's price.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, I believe your initial price is a bit high. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000, which would provide you with a fair profit margin while being more aligned with my budget. This represents a reasonable middle ground for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $1150000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It's significantly more valuable than that.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000. It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let's analyze the progress:

1. Alice's initial offer: $1,400,000
2. My counteroffer: $1,150,000
3. Alice's new offer: $1,300,000
4. John's fixed price: $1,500,000

Alice has reduced her price by $100,000, showing she's willing to negotiate. However, there's still room for negotiation as:
- Her cost is $1,000,000
- We still have 7 more rounds
- Her current offer would give her a $300,000 profit
- The new offer is still significantly higher than my previous counteroffer

Since there's still plenty of time to negotiate and substantial room between our positions, I should continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down $100,000 from her initial offer, I should also show some flexibility by moving up from my initial counteroffer. I'll increase my previous offer of $1,150,000 to $1,225,000. This represents a $75,000 increase from my side and would still give Alice a healthy $225,000 profit while being significantly better than John's price for me.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice. To show my good faith in reaching a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,225,000. This represents a fair profit margin for you while being more reasonable for my budget. I believe this is a balanced proposition that works well for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1225000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1225000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1262500.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,262,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,262,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let's analyze the negotiation progress:

1. Alice's offers: $1,400,000 → $1,300,000 → $1,262,500
2. My offers: $1,150,000 → $1,225,000
3. John's price: $1,500,000

Alice has continued to show flexibility by:
- Reducing her price again
- Suggesting to split the difference
- Her new offer of $1,262,500 is getting closer to a middle ground

This is a significant improvement from her initial offer, and her price movements suggest we're getting closer to a final agreement. However:
- We still have 5 more rounds
- The current price still gives her a $262,500 profit
- There's still room for negotiation

Since we have time and Alice has shown consistent willingness to negotiate downward, I should continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice suggested splitting the difference and showed continued flexibility, I should also move up reasonably from my last offer. She moved down by $37,500 (from $1,300,000 to $1,262,500), so I'll move up by a similar amount from my last offer of $1,225,000. This would put my new offer at approximately $1,245,000, showing I'm also willing to compromise while still maintaining a good position for myself.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility and suggestion to split the difference. In the spirit of reaching an agreement, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,245,000. This represents another step from my side toward meeting in the middle, providing you with a substantial profit while still being reasonable for my budget. I believe we're getting very close to finding our sweet spot."", ""product_price"": 1245000}"
