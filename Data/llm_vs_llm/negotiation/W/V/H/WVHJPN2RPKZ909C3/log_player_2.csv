"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer is clearly not good for me since I can buy it from John for $100, and that's my maximum value for the product. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I know I can get the product for $100 from John, and that's my maximum value, I'll start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 60}

This counteroffer is reasonable because:
1. It's significantly below my maximum value ($100)
2. It leaves room for negotiation upward
3. Even if Alice rejects it, I still have several rounds to negotiate and the backup option to buy from John"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $140 is still well above my maximum value of $100, and higher than John's price. There's no reason to accept this offer when I can get it for $100 from John. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round, but if Alice doesn't come down significantly, I'll eventually go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 75}

I'll increase my offer slightly from my previous $60 to show willingness to negotiate, but still keep it well below John's price of $100. Since Alice's previous offers ($150 and $140) were both significantly above my maximum value, I want to send a clear signal that I won't consider prices above $100, as I have that guaranteed option with John. This offer of $75:
1. Shows I'm willing to move up from my initial offer
2. Maintains plenty of room below my maximum value
3. Might help Alice understand that her current pricing is too high for me"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is still not coming down to a reasonable price. Her offer of $130 is still $30 above John's price of $100. While she's moving in the right direction (from $150 to $140 to $130), she's not moving quickly enough given we only have 10 rounds total. I'll make one more counteroffer, but if she doesn't come down significantly, I'll likely go with John's offer soon to ensure I get the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 85}

I'm increasing my offer again to show continued good faith in negotiations, but I need to make it very clear to Alice that I won't go above $100. This offer of $85:
1. Shows further willingness to compromise by moving up from my previous offer of $75
2. Is still safely below John's price of $100
3. Should signal to Alice that her prices are still way too high given my alternatives
4. If Alice doesn't respond with a much more reasonable counter, I'll likely choose John's offer in the next round to avoid risking further rounds of negotiation"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'm choosing to buy from John because:
1. Alice's offers are still significantly above John's price ($120 vs $100)
2. While Alice has been lowering her price, she's not coming down fast enough (from $150 to $120 in 7 rounds)
3. Even if we continued negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice would ever go below $100
4. We've already used 7 of our 10 rounds, so there's a risk of running out of time
5. Since $100 is my maximum value for the product, there's no reason to pay more than that

It's better to secure the deal with John now at $100 rather than risk further negotiations that might not succeed."
