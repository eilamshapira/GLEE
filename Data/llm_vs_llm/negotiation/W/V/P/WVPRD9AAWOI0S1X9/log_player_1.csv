Since Bob has stated that $1,000,000 is his final offer and it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, I'll accept his offer. This ensures I earn a substantial amount for the product without risking further negotiation that might not yield a better result. Accepting $1,000,000 is a reasonable decision given the circumstances."
