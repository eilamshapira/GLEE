"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. Considering the product's worth to me is $15000, I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my valuation and your offer, but I think a more realistic price would be slightly lower than that.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a lower price point, but I still believe the product is worth more than $12500. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your valuation and my initial offer, I'd like to propose a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, I still think $17500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering we're both trying to find a mutually beneficial price, I'd like to propose a compromise between your revised offer and my previous counteroffer. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I'd like to keep it as close to my valuation as possible.",14000.0,Bob,4,
