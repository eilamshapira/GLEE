Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. Considering the product's worth to me is $15000, I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my valuation and your offer, but I think a more realistic price would be slightly lower than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $12,500 is lower than my initial offer and I believe the product is worth more to him than he's letting on. I'll try to meet him in the middle while still getting a good price for the product. 

My counteroffer: $17,500 

This price is still higher than my initial offer, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate and listen to Bob's concerns. If he's truly interested in the product, he may be willing to meet me at this price or make another counteroffer that's more reasonable."

I understand that you're looking for a lower price point, but I still believe the product is worth more than $12,500. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, I still think $17500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering we're both trying to find a mutually beneficial price, I'd like to propose a compromise between your revised offer and my previous counteroffer. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I'd like to keep it as close to my valuation as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Since Bob's offer of $14,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price and also close to what Jhon is willing to pay ($15,000), I think it's better to sell the product to Jhon for $15,000. This way, I can ensure I get a price that is at least as good as what Bob is offering, without having to continue negotiating and risking Bob walking away or making another lower offer. Selling to Jhon guarantees me a higher price than Bob's current offer, so it's the best choice at this point."
