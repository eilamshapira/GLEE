"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I should analyze this situation carefully. Alice's offer is $120, which is exactly the same price as John's alternative offer. Since the product is worth $120 to me at maximum, I'm not getting any surplus value at this price.

Since Alice's initial offer doesn't save me any money compared to my outside option (buying from John), I should reject and make a counteroffer. There's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice since the product is worth $120 to her as well, meaning she can potentially sell for less and still make some profit.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice is maintaining her $120 offer without any movement, which is the same as John's price. Since we still have several rounds of negotiation left, I should continue trying to find a price that works better for me. I'll reject this offer and try a different counteroffer in the next round.
