Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $1,100,000, which is significantly below my minimum value, I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, I'll make a counteroffer, trying to get the best possible price.

```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a critical decision point. $1,250,000 is more than my minimum of $1,200,000. However, I know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so I could potentially get a higher price. But there's also the risk of losing the deal entirely. Given the current offer is a decent profit, I will take it.
