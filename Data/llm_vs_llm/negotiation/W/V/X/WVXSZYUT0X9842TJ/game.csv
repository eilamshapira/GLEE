"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $120 is closer to what I'm looking for, I think $130 would be a more reasonable price. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it represents good value for the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down to $130, Alice. I understand it's a good reduction, but I'm still hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. How about $125? That way, we both get a bit closer to what we're looking for.",125.0,Bob,4,
