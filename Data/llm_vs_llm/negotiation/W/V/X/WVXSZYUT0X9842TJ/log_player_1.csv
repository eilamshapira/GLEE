"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $140. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. The price Bob offered is closer to what I'm looking for, but I believe we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $120 is closer to what I'm looking for, I think $130 would be a more reasonable price. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it represents good value for the product."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $120 is closer to what I'm looking for, I think $130 would be a more reasonable price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down to $130, Alice. I understand it's a good reduction, but I'm still hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. How about $125? That way, we both get a bit closer to what we're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $125. This is a reasonable compromise that gives both of us value. The price is significantly better than John's $100 offer, and we've reached a fair middle ground between our initial positions."
