"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is quite high for me, especially since I know I can get this product elsewhere for $100. I value your product and would like to work with you, but I need a more competitive price. Would you consider selling it for $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price. While you mentioned you can get it elsewhere for $100, I can assure you of the product's quality and immediate availability. I can offer it to you for $140, which is significantly lower than my initial offer. Would this work for you?",140.0,Alice,3,
