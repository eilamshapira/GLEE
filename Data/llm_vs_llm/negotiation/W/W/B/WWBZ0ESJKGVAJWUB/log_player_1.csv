Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. I'm willing to sell it for $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is quite high for me, especially since I know I can get this product elsewhere for $100. I value your product and would like to work with you, but I need a more competitive price. Would you consider selling it for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. Since Bob mentioned he knows the product is available elsewhere for $100, I'll make a more competitive counteroffer, but still above $100 to try to maximize my profit while being more reasonable than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price. While you mentioned you can get it elsewhere for $100, I can assure you of the product's quality and immediate availability. I can offer it to you for $140, which is significantly lower than my initial offer. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
