"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is significantly above my budget. I have another seller offering the same product for $15000, but I'm interested in working with you. Would you consider $12000 for the product? This would be a fair price that works within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, Thanks for your interest! While I understand your budget constraints, I can't go down to $12000. I believe the product offers significant value. How about we meet in the middle at $16000? It's a great deal for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
