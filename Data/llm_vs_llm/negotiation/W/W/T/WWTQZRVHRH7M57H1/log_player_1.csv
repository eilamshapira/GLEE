"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for round 1:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Considering its unique features and value, I'm offering it to you for $20,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is significantly above my budget. I have another seller offering the same product for $15000, but I'm interested in working with you. Would you consider $12000 for the product? This would be a fair price that works within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Okay, this is Round 2. Bob's offer is $12,000.

Since I value the product at no less than $12,000, accepting would net me exactly my minimum acceptable price. However, there's still a chance to get more. Also, John is always an option.

Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer for Round 3:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, Thanks for your interest! While I understand your budget constraints, I can't go down to $12,000. I believe the product offers significant value. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? It's a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
