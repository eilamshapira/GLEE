"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Considering its unique features and value, I'm offering it to you for $20000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $15,000, and it's also higher than John's guaranteed price. It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations with Alice don't lead to a price below $15,000, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20,000 is significantly above my budget. I have another seller offering the same product for $15,000, but I'm interested in working with you. Would you consider $12,000 for the product? This would be a fair price that works within my budget."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, Thanks for your interest! While I understand your budget constraints, I can't go down to $12000. I believe the product offers significant value. How about we meet in the middle at $16000? It's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer of $16,000 is still above John's guaranteed price of $15,000, and Alice has shown she's not willing to go below my maximum value, it makes the most sense to take John's offer. There's no reason to continue negotiating when we have a better price readily available."
