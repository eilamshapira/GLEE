,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price. However, the value of this product justifies a higher investment. I'm willing to lower my price to $1800000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it represents a fair value for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $1800000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1500000. If you're serious about selling, this might be a good compromise for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're trying to find a middle ground. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1650000? This price reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer and should be within a reasonable range for you. Let's make this work.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1650000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1400000. This is a substantial offer, and I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but I need to ensure the value is right for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1550000. This is my final offer before considering other options. Let's close this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but $1550000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1450000. This is a significant amount for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's make this work.",1450000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm keen on finalizing this deal with you. I can go down to $1500000, which is a substantial reduction from my previous offers. This is my best and final offer. Let's make it happen.",1500000.0,Alice,9,
