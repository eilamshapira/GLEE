"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, I believe your initial price is quite high. Given market conditions and comparable products, I would be comfortable starting at $800000. This leaves us room to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm looking forward to your thoughts on this.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the market value. However, this product offers unique advantages and a significant upside potential that I believe justifies a higher price.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my offer and showing flexibility, Alice. I appreciate you moving on the price. While $1100000 is a step in the right direction, I feel we're still a bit far apart. I can increase my offer to $900000, which I believe better reflects the current market conditions while still recognizing the product's unique features you mentioned. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your understanding of the product's value.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to accept $1000000 for this. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal considering the unique benefits this product offers.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
