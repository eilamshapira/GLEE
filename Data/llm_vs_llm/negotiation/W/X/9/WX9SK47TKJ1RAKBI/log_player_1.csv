I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, I believe your initial price is quite high. Given market conditions and comparable products, I would be comfortable starting at $800000. This leaves us room to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm looking forward to your thoughts on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the market value. However, this product offers unique advantages and a significant upside potential that I believe justifies a higher price.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

I want to signal that I'm willing to negotiate but also stand firm on the product's value exceeding Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer and showing flexibility, Alice. I appreciate you moving on the price. While $1100000 is a step in the right direction, I feel we're still a bit far apart. I can increase my offer to $900000, which I believe better reflects the current market conditions while still recognizing the product's unique features you mentioned. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your understanding of the product's value.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 for this. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal considering the unique benefits this product offers.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

This is a strategic point to make a firm stand and signal this is my best offer. This approach aims to potentially expedite the negotiation process while still striving for a price significantly above John's offer."
