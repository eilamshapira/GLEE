"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm starting with a competitive price, considering the product's worth to me.",3000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I must say that $3000000 is significantly above my budget and the market value I've researched. The product is worth no more than $1200000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product, which gives you a quick sale while saving me from having to go to another seller.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $900000. I understand that you have a budget in mind, but I must emphasize that the product's value to me is substantially higher. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Considering your reference to John's offer, I'm making a counteroffer that I believe is more reasonable. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes the product's true worth.",2200000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for reducing your offer, which shows you're willing to negotiate. However, $2200000 is still substantially above what makes economic sense for me. As I mentioned, the product is worth no more than $1200000 to me, and I have John's firm offer at exactly that price. To make it worthwhile to buy from you instead, I need a better price. I'm willing to offer $1050000, which is actually above what I can get elsewhere, reflecting my preference to do business with you. But I need to be practical about this purchase - if we can't find common ground near this range, I'll have to accept John's offer.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your revised offer of $1050000 and the fact that you're willing to pay a premium to do business with me. However, I must reiterate that the product holds significant value to me, and I'm looking for a price that reflects its worth. While I understand your budget constraints, I'm trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm reducing my price further to $1800000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise considering the product's unique qualities and the value it can bring to you. I'm open to continuing our negotiation, but I need to see a more substantial movement towards my target price.",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on finding a mutually agreeable price. I recognize that you've made some movement in your offers, coming down from $3000000 to $1800000. However, I need to be completely transparent - I cannot justify paying $1800000 for a product that's worth $1200000 to me, especially when I have a guaranteed option to purchase it at exactly that price from another seller. To demonstrate my sincere interest in working with you specifically, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1150000, which is already above my alternative option. This represents my strong preference to purchase from you, but I must be fiscally responsible with my decision. If we cannot reach an agreement near this price point, I will unfortunately need to pursue the alternative option available to me.",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your latest offer of $1150000 and the effort you've put into trying to find a price that works for both of us. I understand your constraints and the value you've placed on the product. In an effort to bridge the gap between our positions, I'm making a significant concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1400000, which is a substantial reduction from my previous offers. This price reflects my strong desire to complete the sale with you, as I believe our partnership could be beneficial in the long run. However, I must emphasize that this is a serious commitment on my part, and I hope you can recognize the value in meeting at this price point. If we can agree on $1400000, I'm confident we can finalize the details and move forward positively.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your continued effort to reach an agreement. I appreciate the significant reduction in your asking price to $1400000. This shows real progress in our negotiation. However, I must be honest that this price still exceeds both my budget constraint and the alternative offer I have from John at $1200000. Since the product is worth no more than $1200000 to me, accepting your current offer would actually result in a financial loss. As a final attempt to close this deal between us, I'm offering $1190000 - which is very close to my maximum but still gives you a slight premium over my alternative. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to go with John's offer as a matter of financial responsibility. I hope we can conclude our negotiation positively at this price point.",1190000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your final offer of $1190000 and the effort you've put into our negotiation. However, after careful consideration, I'm willing to make one last adjustment to try and meet your needs. I can offer the product for $1450000, which is my lowest price considering the product's value and our negotiation history. If this is not acceptable, I will have to explore other options that better align with my financial goals.",1450000.0,Alice,9,
