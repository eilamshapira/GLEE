"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That's a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, $80 is a bit too low for me.  I understand you have a budget, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $125?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground. While $125 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Could you do $100? That would be a great price for me.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $100, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. Let's try $110. I think that's a reasonable compromise for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer!  How about $105?  That's the highest I can go.",105.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your budget, but $105 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $108. This is my final offer.",108.0,Alice,7,
