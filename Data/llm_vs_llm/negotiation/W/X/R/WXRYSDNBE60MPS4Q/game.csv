"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, I must inform you that I have an alternative option from John for $1200000. This is actually the maximum value the product represents to my business needs. However, I would prefer to work with you if we can reach a more competitive price. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product, which would allow me some savings compared to my alternative option. Would this work for you?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I must point out that your offer of $900000 is significantly below the market value of this product. I find it interesting that you mentioned having an alternative option from John at $1200000, as I'm actually in contact with John as well. Let's be transparent in our negotiations. Given the product's true value and quality, I can offer it to you for $1600000. This is a considerable reduction from my initial offer and represents excellent value for a product of this caliber. Would you be interested in proceeding at this price?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for lowering your price, but $1600000 is still significantly above what makes financial sense for me. The product is worth no more than $1200000 to my business, which is exactly what John is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer $1050000, which would save me some money compared to John's price while still giving you a good deal. This is a fair offer considering my budget constraints and the product's value to me. Can we make this work?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
