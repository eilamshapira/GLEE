Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. Based on its quality and market worth, I'm offering it at $2,000,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, I must inform you that I have an alternative option from John for $1200000. This is actually the maximum value the product represents to my business needs. However, I would prefer to work with you if we can reach a more competitive price. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product, which would allow me some savings compared to my alternative option. Would this work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Bob's claim about having an alternative option from John for $1,200,000 seems questionable since I know John is actually my alternative buyer. I will continue negotiating with Bob to try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I must point out that your offer of $900,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. I find it interesting that you mentioned having an alternative option from John at $1,200,000, as I'm actually in contact with John as well. Let's be transparent in our negotiations. Given the product's true value and quality, I can offer it to you for $1,600,000. This is a considerable reduction from my initial offer and represents excellent value for a product of this caliber. Would you be interested in proceeding at this price?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for lowering your price, but $1600000 is still significantly above what makes financial sense for me. The product is worth no more than $1200000 to my business, which is exactly what John is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer $1050000, which would save me some money compared to John's price while still giving you a good deal. This is a fair offer considering my budget constraints and the product's value to me. Can we make this work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob keeps mentioning that the product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to him and his latest offer is still significantly below that, it's best to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. Bob's negotiation strategy suggests he's unlikely to exceed this price, and continuing the negotiation might just waste time while risking losing the sure deal with John."
