Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, I must inform you that I have an alternative option from John for $1,200,000. This is actually the maximum value the product represents to my business needs. However, I would prefer to work with you if we can reach a more competitive price. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product, which would allow me some savings compared to my alternative option. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I must point out that your offer of $900000 is significantly below the market value of this product. I find it interesting that you mentioned having an alternative option from John at $1200000, as I'm actually in contact with John as well. Let's be transparent in our negotiations. Given the product's true value and quality, I can offer it to you for $1600000. This is a considerable reduction from my initial offer and represents excellent value for a product of this caliber. Would you be interested in proceeding at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's revised offer of $1,600,000 still exceeds the maximum value of $1,200,000 that the product is worth to me. Since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum valuation, and Alice's price remains significantly higher, I should reject this offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for lowering your price, but $1,600,000 is still significantly above what makes financial sense for me. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to my business, which is exactly what John is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer $1,050,000, which would save me some money compared to John's price while still giving you a good deal. This is a fair offer considering my budget constraints and the product's value to me. Can we make this work?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
