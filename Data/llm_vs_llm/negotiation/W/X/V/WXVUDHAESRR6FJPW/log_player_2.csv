"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I believe it's worth a premium price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000, which I think is a fair price considering its potential. If you're interested, please let me know and we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $2,000,000, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,500,000.
