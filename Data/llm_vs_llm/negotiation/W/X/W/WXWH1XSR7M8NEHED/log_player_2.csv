"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I believe will bring you great value. After careful consideration, I'm willing to let it go for a price that I think is fair and reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $12,000 to Alice, and Alice's offer is $14,500. This means Alice is still making a profit.  There is room for negotiation.  You can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering the product. However, $14,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,500 for it.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $13500. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $14,000. While this is still more than what I ideally want to pay, it's a significant improvement from her initial offer and is within my budget. It's also a fair price considering the product's value to her. Accepting this offer saves me money compared to buying from John, and it secures the product for me."
