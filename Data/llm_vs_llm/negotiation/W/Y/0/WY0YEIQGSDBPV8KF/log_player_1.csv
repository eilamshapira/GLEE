Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I've got a great product I think you'll love. How about I offer it to you for $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit high for me. I can get the same product from another seller for $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider selling it for $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Okay, given Bob's counteroffer of $65, which is below my minimum acceptable price of $80, and considering I have John offering $80, I will:
