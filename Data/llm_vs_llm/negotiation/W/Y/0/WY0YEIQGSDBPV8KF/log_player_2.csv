"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I've got a great product I think you'll love. How about I offer it to you for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","The offer of $100 is higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). There's no reason to accept this offer when I can get it cheaper from John. However, I could try to negotiate with Alice first to potentially get an even better deal.

Given that:
1. Alice's offer ($100) > John's price ($80)
2. Alice's offer ($100) > My maximum value ($80)
3. I have the option to negotiate

I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price than John's $80.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than John's price to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to be insulting.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit high for me. I can get the same product from another seller for $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider selling it for $65?"", ""product_price"": 65}"
