"Hello Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $1600000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something of great value. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $1600000 is much higher than what I can pay. The product is worth no more than $1200000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for exactly that amount. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable price. I can offer you $1000000 for the product. This gives you a good deal while still making it worthwhile for me to purchase from you rather than your competitor.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $1000000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I understand your situation, but I need to ensure that the price reflects the value of the product. I'm willing to lower my price to $1550000 to meet you halfway. Let me know what you think.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given the value of the product to both of us, I'm prepared to adjust my offer to $1525000. This is a fair compromise that still allows you to benefit from the purchase while ensuring I receive a reasonable return. What are your thoughts on this?",1525000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. However, $1525000 is still significantly above what makes economic sense for me. As I mentioned, the product is worth $1200000 to me, which is exactly what John is offering. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead of John, I need a better price. I can offer you $1100000. This gives you a fair profit while providing me with some incentive to choose you over your competitor. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. However, $1100000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I understand the value to you, but I need to ensure I'm not selling at a loss. I'm willing to lower my price further to $1510000. This is my final offer before considering other options. Please let me know if this works for you.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your position, but I need to maintain a certain value for the product. I'm willing to come down to $1510000, which is as low as I can go while still ensuring a fair deal for both of us. Please consider this offer carefully, as it's my final one before I consider other options.",1510000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to maintain value, but I need to be practical about this purchase. Your offer of $1510000 is still $310000 more than what John is offering for the identical product ($1200000). The product is worth exactly $1200000 to me, so paying more would be a financial loss on my part. I'm willing to offer you $1150000, which is $50000 above what I can get elsewhere. This represents my willingness to work with you specifically, but I can't justify anything higher given my alternatives. If we can't reach an agreement close to this price, I'll need to proceed with John's offer.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1150000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I understand your constraints, but I have to consider my own financial needs. I'm willing to lower my price to $1500000, which is the lowest I can go. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to consider other options, including selling to John. Please let me know your decision.",,Alice,6,RejectOffer
