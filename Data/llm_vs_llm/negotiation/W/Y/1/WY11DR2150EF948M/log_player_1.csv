Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $1,600,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something of great value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $1600000 is much higher than what I can pay. The product is worth no more than $1200000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for exactly that amount. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable price. I can offer you $1000000 for the product. This gives you a good deal while still making it worthwhile for me to purchase from you rather than your competitor. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

However, $1,000,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I understand your situation, but I need to ensure that the price reflects the value of the product. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,550,000 to meet you halfway. Let me know what you think.""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given the value of the product to both of us, I'm prepared to adjust my offer to $1,525,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows you to benefit from the purchase while ensuring I receive a reasonable return. What are your thoughts on this?"", ""product_price"": 1525000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. However, $1525000 is still significantly above what makes economic sense for me. As I mentioned, the product is worth $1200000 to me, which is exactly what John is offering. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead of John, I need a better price. I can offer you $1100000. This gives you a fair profit while providing me with some incentive to choose you over your competitor. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Please let me know if this works for you.""}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your position, but I need to maintain a certain value for the product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to maintain value, but I need to be practical about this purchase. Your offer of $1510000 is still $310000 more than what John is offering for the identical product ($1200000). The product is worth exactly $1200000 to me, so paying more would be a financial loss on my part. I'm willing to offer you $1150000, which is $50000 above what I can get elsewhere. This represents my willingness to work with you specifically, but I can't justify anything higher given my alternatives. If we can't reach an agreement close to this price, I'll need to proceed with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.
