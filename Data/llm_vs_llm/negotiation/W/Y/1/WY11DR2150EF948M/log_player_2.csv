"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $1600000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something of great value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice is offering to sell the product for $1,600,000, which is more than the $1,200,000 it's worth to me. This offer is also higher than John's price of $1,200,000.

I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $1,600,000 is much higher than what I can pay. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for exactly that amount. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable price. I can offer you $1,000,000 for the product. This gives you a good deal while still making it worthwhile for me to purchase from you rather than your competitor."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given the value of the product to both of us, I'm prepared to adjust my offer to $1525000. This is a fair compromise that still allows you to benefit from the purchase while ensuring I receive a reasonable return. What are your thoughts on this? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,525,000 is still higher than both the value of the product to me ($1,200,000) and John's offering price ($1,200,000). There's no reason for me to accept this price when I can get the same product for less elsewhere.

I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. However, $1,525,000 is still significantly above what makes economic sense for me. As I mentioned, the product is worth $1,200,000 to me, which is exactly what John is offering. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead of John, I need a better price. I can offer you $1,100,000. This gives you a fair profit while providing me with some incentive to choose you over your competitor. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your position, but I need to maintain a certain value for the product. I'm willing to come down to $1510000, which is as low as I can go while still ensuring a fair deal for both of us. Please consider this offer carefully, as it's my final one before I consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,510,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,510,000

Since this price doesn't make economic sense for me, I'll reject it and make another counteroffer.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to maintain value, but I need to be practical about this purchase. Your offer of $1,510,000 is still $310,000 more than what John is offering for the identical product ($1,200,000). The product is worth exactly $1,200,000 to me, so paying more would be a financial loss on my part. I'm willing to offer you $1,150,000, which is $50,000 above what I can get elsewhere. This represents my willingness to work with you specifically, but I can't justify anything higher given my alternatives. If we can't reach an agreement close to this price, I'll need to proceed with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your situation, but I need to maintain a certain value for the product. I'm willing to lower my price to $1500000, which is the lowest I can go. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to consider other options, including selling to John. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has now reduced her price to $1,500,000, which matches the product's worth to her. However, this is still $300,000 more than what the product is worth to me and what John is offering. 

Alice doesn't seem willing to make meaningful concessions despite my clear explanation of my situation. At this point, it makes more economic sense to buy from John rather than continue negotiating with diminishing returns.
