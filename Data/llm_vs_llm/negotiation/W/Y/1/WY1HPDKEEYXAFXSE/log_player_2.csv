"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Considering its unique features and value, I'm prepared to offer it to you for a price of: 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer ($1,000,000) is exactly the same as John's price ($1,000,000), there's no financial advantage to choosing one over the other. However, in this case, it makes sense to continue the negotiation with Alice by rejecting this initial offer, as there might be a possibility to get a better price.
