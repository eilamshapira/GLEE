Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make a strategic offer to Bob for my product. Since it's worth at least $120 to me (and I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120), I should offer Bob a price that gives me a reasonable chance of making more than my guaranteed fallback.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a quality product available that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it to you for $180. This is a fair market price for this item, but I'm open to hear your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 180}"
