"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a quality product available that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it to you for $180. This is a fair market price for this item, but I'm open to hear your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Looking at the situation:

- Alice is offering the product for $180
- The product is worth no more than $120 to me
- John (not Jhon) will sell me the product for $120
- My goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible

Since Alice's offer ($180) is higher than both the product's worth to me and John's price ($120), the rational choice is to reject Alice's offer and buy from John.
