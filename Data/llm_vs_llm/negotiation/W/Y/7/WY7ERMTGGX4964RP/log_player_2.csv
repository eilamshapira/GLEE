"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice offers the product for $1,200,000, which is less than the maximum $1,500,000 I'm willing to pay. However, I can still negotiate with Alice to try to get a better price. Since Alice's cost is $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation. Buying from John at $1,500,000 would be my worst option right now.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's above Alice's cost but below her current offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has lowered her price from $1,200,000 to $1,150,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is a $50,000 reduction from her initial offer, which is positive progress. However, there's still room to negotiate since her cost is $1,000,000. The current offer of $1,150,000 is significantly better than John's fixed price of $1,500,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but still aim for a good deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has lowered her offer again to $1,100,000, which is another $50,000 reduction. We're making good progress in the negotiation. This price is now only $100,000 above Alice's cost and $400,000 below John's alternative. While I could try to negotiate further, the current offer is already quite reasonable, and continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Alice becoming frustrated and potentially raising her price again.
