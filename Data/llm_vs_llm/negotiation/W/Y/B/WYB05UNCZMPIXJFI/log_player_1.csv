"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Let me start with a relatively high offer to establish an anchor point and leave room for negotiation while ensuring I can still make a good profit.

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $12,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still better than John's guaranteed $10,000. However, since this is only round 2 out of 10, and Bob has already shown willingness to negotiate by making a reasonable counteroffer, I believe there's potential to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a new counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob offered $12,000, I'll come down from my initial price but still maintain a strong position. I'll aim for a price roughly halfway between our previous offers to show willingness to negotiate while maintaining good profit potential.
