"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Given that my maximum value for the product is $15,000 and John is willing to sell it at exactly that price, I would never accept an offer of $20,000 from Alice. This price is significantly above my maximum value. I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get a better price than both Alice's current offer and John's alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 12000}

I'll offer $12,000, which is significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer of $20,000 and John's fixed price of $15,000. This gives room for negotiation while potentially allowing me to save money compared to John's price. If Alice rejects this offer, we can still negotiate further, and I always have John's $15,000 offer as a backup option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's new offer ($16,000) is still above John's fixed price ($15,000), and I won't accept any price above $15,000 (my maximum value), the rational decision is to buy from John. Even if I continue negotiating with Alice, I can't be certain she'll go below $15,000, and I'd be using up more rounds of negotiation. John's price is guaranteed and is at my maximum acceptable price point, so it's the safe and economical choice."
