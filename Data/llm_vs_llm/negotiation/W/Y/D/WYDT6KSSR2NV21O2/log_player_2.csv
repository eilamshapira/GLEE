Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is substantial and I'm confident in its potential to deliver significant returns.  To move us closer, how about we consider $1300000?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working to find common ground.  This product represents a significant opportunity, and I want to ensure it's valued fairly.  Let's try $975000. This feels like a point where we both see the value and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $975,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. It's better to secure the product from John at the known price of $800,000."
