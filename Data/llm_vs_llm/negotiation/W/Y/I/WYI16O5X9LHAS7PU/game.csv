"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! Unfortunately, $180 is beyond my budget. Given my constraints, I can offer $80 for the product. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must say that $80 is a bit lower than I was expecting. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $160, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. Let me know if this works for you.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the adjustment, Alice. I understand the value you're conveying, but I have a strict limit. Could we meet closer to the middle? I can offer $90 for the product.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, $90 is still below my expectations. I'm willing to make another adjustment to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current one. I can offer the product to you for $145. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",145.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your patience in our negotiations. Since I have a firm budget cap, the highest I can reasonably offer is $100, which is also the price I've been offered elsewhere. I hope you might consider this.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your transparency about the alternative offer you've received. However, I still believe the product's value exceeds $100. Considering your budget constraints and the alternative offer, I'm willing to make a more significant concession. I can offer the product to you for $130, which is closer to your target price. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",130.0,Alice,7,
