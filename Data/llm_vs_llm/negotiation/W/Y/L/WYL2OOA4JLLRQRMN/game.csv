"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1100000 is fair. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I think $1100000 is a bit high for me. Considering the product's value to me, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This offer reflects the true worth of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $1050000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think the price is a bit high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $920000. I believe this is a reasonable price, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but my last offer was already a significant compromise. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer ready to purchase at a higher price.  However, I value our negotiation and believe we can still reach an agreement. My final offer is $1000000.  This is non-negotiable.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
