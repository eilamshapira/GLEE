Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'd like to start the negotiation at a price that reflects its true value."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to send a counteroffer to Bob. Since he's willing to pay $9,500, I believe we can still negotiate a better price. My counteroffer is $10,500. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit high, but I believe the product is worth more than $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500. Let me know if this price works for you.""}"
