"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Looking at Alice's offer, she's asking for $1,000,000 for the product. This exceeds the maximum value of $800,000 that the product is worth to me. Since I know I can buy the same product from John for exactly $800,000, it wouldn't make economic sense to accept Alice's current offer.

I could reject and make a counteroffer, but given that John's offer matches exactly what the product is worth to me, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice unless I believe she would accept a price significantly below $800,000.
