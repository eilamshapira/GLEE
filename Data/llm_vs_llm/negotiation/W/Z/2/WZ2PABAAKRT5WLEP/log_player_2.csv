"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer is way too high - it's even higher than Alice's own valuation and my maximum value of $8,000. It would be better to make a counteroffer much closer to my valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still gives some room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 6000}

This offer is below my maximum value of $8,000 and gives room for negotiation while still potentially allowing both parties to benefit from the trade. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground, or I always have the option to go with John's $8,000 offer if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $10,000 is still above both John's price ($8,000) and my maximum valuation ($8,000). While Alice has come down from her initial offer, there's no reason for me to accept a price higher than my maximum valuation when I have John's offer as a backup. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 7000}

I'll increase my offer to $7,000, which is higher than my previous offer but still below my maximum valuation of $8,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate upward while maintaining a price that would be beneficial for me. If Alice rejects this, I still have the safety net of John's $8,000 offer, but this gives Alice a chance to make a deal that could benefit both of us. The price point leaves room for one more potential negotiation round while still being better than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, it's best to take John's offer of $8,000. Here's why:
1. Alice's current offer ($9,000) is still above my maximum valuation ($8,000)
2. While Alice has been coming down in price, the negotiation is moving slowly and we're already in round 5
3. John's offer at $8,000 is exactly at my maximum valuation
4. There's no guarantee Alice will come down to or below $8,000 in future rounds

It's more prudent to take the guaranteed good deal from John rather than continue negotiating with Alice when we might not reach an acceptable price."
