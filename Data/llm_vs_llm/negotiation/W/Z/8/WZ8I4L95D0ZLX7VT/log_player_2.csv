"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $1,100,000 against my alternatives.

Since:
- The product is worth up to $1,200,000 to me
- Alice's offer ($1,100,000) is less than both my maximum value and John's price ($1,200,000)
- I still have 9 more rounds to negotiate if I reject
- I can always fall back on John's offer later

Given these factors, I should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price. I can potentially save more than the $100,000 difference between Alice's offer and John's price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that gives us room to negotiate upward while still aiming for a good deal. Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, I'll start with a price that's reasonably above her cost but well below her initial offer.

{""product_price"": $850,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced her price from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, we still have room to negotiate further since there's a significant gap between her cost ($800,000) and her current offer ($1,050,000).

With 7 more potential rounds remaining, I should continue negotiating to try to get a better price. Her willingness to drop $50,000 from her initial offer is promising.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down $50,000 from her initial offer, I'll increase my offer by a similar amount. This shows I'm negotiating in good faith while still trying to reach a price closer to the middle ground between her cost and my maximum value.

{""product_price"": $900,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced her price again from $1,050,000 to $1,020,000. She's continuing to move in the right direction, although in smaller increments now ($30,000 vs the previous $50,000).

We still have 5 more potential rounds after this one, and I'm getting a price that's already $180,000 better than John's alternative. However, I believe we can still negotiate a better deal since there's room between her cost ($800,000) and her current offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice is making smaller concessions now, which suggests we're getting closer to her bottom line. I'll increase my offer proportionally to demonstrate continued good faith in the negotiation while still working toward a middle ground.

{""product_price"": $950,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has now reduced her price to an even $1,000,000, which is a $20,000 reduction from her previous offer. We're making progress, and this price is now $200,000 better than John's alternative.

With 3 more potential rounds after this one, I still have some room to negotiate. The price is already fairly reasonable, but I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since we're in the later rounds of negotiation and Alice's concessions are getting smaller, I'll make a more substantial increase to my offer to try to close the deal. I want to bridge the gap significantly while still getting a good price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $992,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $992,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $992,500 represents only a $7,500 reduction from her previous offer of $1,000,000. We're seeing diminishing reductions, which suggests we're approaching her limit. 

At this point, her offer is $207,500 better than John's price of $1,200,000, which is a substantial savings. We only have one more round after this, and the risk of pushing too hard is that we might end up having to accept a less favorable final offer or revert to John's much higher price.

Given that we've already negotiated the price down significantly and the current offer represents good value compared to our alternatives, I'll accept this offer.
