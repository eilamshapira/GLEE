"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","In this case, since Alice's offer is $150, which is exactly the same as John's price, and it's also the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, there's no advantage in continuing negotiation. I could reject and make a counteroffer, but since there's another seller (John) at $150, Alice has no incentive to go lower, as I could just go to John at any time.
