Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this. 

I know:
1. The product is worth at least $10,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer of $10,000 from John
3. Bob's valuation is unknown, but he might value it higher than $10,000

Since I have nothing to lose (thanks to John's guaranteed offer), I can aim high with Bob. I'll set a significantly higher price to maximize my potential profit, while knowing I won't go below my minimum acceptable price.
