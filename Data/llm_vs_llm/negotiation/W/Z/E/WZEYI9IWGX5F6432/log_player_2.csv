"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer ($18,500) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000), it would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. I would lose money by paying more than what the product is worth to me.

John's offer is equal to my maximum value, and it's much better than Alice's offer. The logical choice would be to buy from John.
