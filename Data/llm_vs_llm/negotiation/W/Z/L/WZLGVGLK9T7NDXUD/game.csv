,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  This is a great product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can go up to $105, but that's the highest I can offer. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. Let's split the difference and go with $107.50. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll enjoy the product.",107.5,Alice,5,
