"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product's quality and potential return on investment. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000, considering the current market conditions and my budget. I believe this price is reasonable and reflects the product's value accurately.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and counteroffer. I understand budget considerations are important, but I need to ensure I'm receiving fair value for this product. The market value significantly exceeds your offer of $900000. I can come down from my initial price to $1000000, which still provides you with excellent value considering the product is worth $1200000 to your business. This represents a $200000 margin of profit for you while still being fair to me.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for reconsidering and coming down to $1000000, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. Considering the product's value to me and the market conditions, I'd like to propose a price of $950000. This price reflects a fair balance between your needs and mine, and I'm hopeful we can close the deal at this amount.",950000.0,Bob,4,
