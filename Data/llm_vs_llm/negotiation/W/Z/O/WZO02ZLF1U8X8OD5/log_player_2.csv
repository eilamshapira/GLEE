Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and counteroffer. I understand budget considerations are important, but I need to ensure I'm receiving fair value for this product. The market value significantly exceeds your offer of $900000. I can come down from my initial price to $1000000, which still provides you with excellent value considering the product is worth $1200000 to your business. This represents a $200000 margin of profit for you while still being fair to me.
