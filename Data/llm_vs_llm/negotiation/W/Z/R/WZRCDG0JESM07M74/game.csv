"Alice, thank you for the offer, but I find the price to be quite high. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1400000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in continuing the discussion.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1400000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to raise my offer to $900000. This is a fair price that works within my budget. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're not quite aligned on the price yet. While I understand your budget constraints, $900000 is simply not a viable price for me. However, I'm still interested in working with you. To bridge the gap, I'm proposing a final price of $1200000. This is a significant compromise, but it's the best I can offer. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
