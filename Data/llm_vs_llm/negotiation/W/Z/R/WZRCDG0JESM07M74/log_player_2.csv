# Alice's message: Bob, I see that we're not quite aligned on the price yet. While I understand your budget constraints, $900000 is simply not a viable price for me. However, I'm still interested in working with you. To bridge the gap, I'm proposing a final price of $1200000. This is a significant compromise, but it's the best I can offer.
