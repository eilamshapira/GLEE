"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $12500, which I think is a fair price considering its features and market value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $15,000
2. Alice is offering the product for $12,500
3. John's fixed price is $15,000

Alice's offer is $2,500 less than John's price and also below my maximum value of $15,000. This is a good deal as it saves me money compared to buying from John, and it's within my budget.
