"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given the information provided, I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer, make a counteroffer, or buy from John.

Alice is offering the product for $9,600, but the product is only worth $8,000 to me at maximum. Additionally, I have the option to buy the product from John for $8,000.

Since Alice's offer ($9,600) exceeds both my maximum valuation and John's price, it would not be rational to accept it. I could try to negotiate with Alice, but since I already have a guaranteed option to buy at $8,000 from John (which matches my maximum valuation), the logical choice is to buy from John.
