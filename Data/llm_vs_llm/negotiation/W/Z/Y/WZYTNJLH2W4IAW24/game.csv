"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $5000 for the product.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $5000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet in the middle? I'd be willing to come down to $22000.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still considerably more than I'm looking to spend. How about we try $7000? I think that's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're still quite far apart, but I see you're serious. Let's try $20000. That's as low as I can reasonably go at this point.",20000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $20000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. My final offer is $7500. If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",7500.0,Bob,6,
