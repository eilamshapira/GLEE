I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a bit higher than my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $70. I will try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 
 
I'm offering $90. It's a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this is more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75.

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer.  I'm going to try to get a better price."

Round 5

I'm offering $85 now. This is a bit closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement soon."
