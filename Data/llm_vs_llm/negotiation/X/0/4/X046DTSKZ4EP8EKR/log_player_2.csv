"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Looking at my options:

1. Accept Alice's offer and pay $11,000
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John for $12,000

Since the product is worth up to $12,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $11,000 is less than that amount, it makes sense to accept her offer. This saves me $1,000 compared to buying from John.
