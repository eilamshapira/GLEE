"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a special price of $10000. This is a limited-time offer, so let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $8,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering it for $10,000
3. John is offering it for $8,000
4. Alice's offer ($10,000) is:
   - Above my maximum value ($8,000)
   - Higher than John's price ($8,000)

Since Alice's offer ($10,000) is higher than both:
- The maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($8,000)
- John's alternative offer ($8,000)

The logical choice is to buy from John, as it matches my maximum value and saves me $2,000 compared to Alice's offer.
