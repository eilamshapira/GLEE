"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Given the options, I need to make the best financial decision:

1. Alice's offer is $15,000, which is exactly what the product is worth to her
2. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
3. John is willing to sell it for $12,000

Alice's current offer does not save me any money compared to John's fixed price. In fact, it would cost me $3,000 more than the maximum I value the product at. While I could make a counteroffer, there's no guarantee Alice would accept anything below her $15,000 valuation.
