"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $95, which I think is a fair price given its quality and value."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! However, I was hoping to get the product for a bit less. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round. $85 is too close to my minimum value ($80), and I know the product is worth $100 to Bob. There's still room for negotiation to reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I can't go that low. Given the product's quality and value, I can offer it to you for $90, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the reduction, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $87? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $87. While I might theoretically get a bit more, this is a good deal that's well above my minimum price of $80, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. It's a reasonable compromise that gives both parties value."
