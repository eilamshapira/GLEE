"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its market value and potential benefits, I'm offering it at $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and the value it will bring to you."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, I'm looking to get the best deal possible. Considering my budget, I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. While $1,200,000 is better than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation since I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer of $1,200,000, but I believe we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. Given the product's value and potential returns for your business, I'm willing to reduce my initial price to $1,325,000. This represents a significant discount from my first offer while still reflecting the product's true worth."", ""product_price"": 1325000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks, Alice. I still feel like we can do better. How about $1250000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,250,000. While it's lower than my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise that gives me a good profit margin ($250,000 more than John's offer). Since Bob stated this is his final offer, pushing further might risk losing the deal, and the difference with John's offer is significant enough to make this worthwhile."
