I will add a note to let Bob know that I am willing to negotiate, but the price of $1,000,000 is too low for me to accept. I will remind him that the product is valued at $1,200,000 and that my current offer is only slightly higher than that. I will also hint that I have another buyer interested in the product, to create a sense of urgency."
