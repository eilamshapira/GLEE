(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,200,000), I will reject her offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a relatively low offer.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,200,000), but it's getting closer. I'll reject her offer again and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer decreased by $100,000 from $1,400,000 to $1,300,000, I'll try to meet her halfway and increase my offer by $50,000 from $1,000,000 to $1,050,000, and then also add another $50,000 to show that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price, but still below my maximum budget.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,250,000 is very close to my maximum budget of $1,200,000, but it's still slightly above it. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, which is my maximum budget, I think it's not worth paying more to Alice.
