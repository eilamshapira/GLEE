"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I believe the price is a bit high for my budget. I would like to make a counteroffer of $900000 for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $900000 is quite a bit below the fair market value of this product. I understand budget concerns, but this product is worth $1200000 to someone with your needs. I'm willing to come down to $980000, which still represents an excellent value for you while allowing me a reasonable return. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still believe the price is higher than what I can agree to. How about we settle on $850000 for the product?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I understand you have budget constraints, but $850000 is still significantly below the product's true value to you. I know this product is worth $1200000 to someone with your specific needs. Let me meet you closer to the middle - I can offer $920000, which represents a substantial discount off the initial price while still being fair to both of us. This is a win-win price point that I hope you'll find acceptable.",920000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still cannot meet the price of $920000. I would like to propose $800000 as my final offer for the product.",800000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but I notice your offers are moving downward rather than meeting me in the middle. Your latest offer of $800000 is exactly what John is willing to pay, yet this product is worth considerably more to you at $1200000. I'm willing to make one more reasonable offer at $880000. This gives you a $320000 surplus in value while still providing me with a fair return. If we can't reach an agreement at this price point, I'll need to move forward with John's offer instead.",880000.0,Alice,7,
