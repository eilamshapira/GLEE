Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $900000 is quite a bit below the fair market value of this product. I understand budget concerns, but this product is worth $1200000 to someone with your needs. I'm willing to come down to $980000, which still represents an excellent value for you while allowing me a reasonable return. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I understand you have budget constraints, but $850000 is still significantly below the product's true value to you. I know this product is worth $1200000 to someone with your specific needs. Let me meet you closer to the middle - I can offer $920000, which represents a substantial discount off the initial price while still being fair to both of us. This is a win-win price point that I hope you'll find acceptable.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but I notice your offers are moving downward rather than meeting me in the middle. Your latest offer of $800000 is exactly what John is willing to pay, yet this product is worth considerably more to you at $1200000. I'm willing to make one more reasonable offer at $880000. This gives you a $320000 surplus in value while still providing me with a fair return. If we can't reach an agreement at this price point, I'll need to move forward with John's offer instead.
