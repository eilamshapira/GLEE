"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, I need to let you know that the product is worth no more than $8000 to me based on my needs and budget. I also have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer you $6500 for the product. This allows you to make a sale today while giving me some savings compared to my alternative option. Would this work for you?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, after considering your situation, I'm willing to lower my offer to $9000. This price reflects the product's value and my own needs while keeping your budget in mind. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price to $9000. That's a step in the right direction, but I'm still in a difficult position. As I mentioned, the product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and John is offering it at exactly $8000. I'd like to do business with you instead, but I can't justify paying more than the product's value to me. My best offer is $7500, which would save me some money compared to John's price while still giving you a sale today. If we can't reach an agreement at or below $8000, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,4,
