Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, I need to let you know that the product is worth no more than $8000 to me based on my needs and budget. I also have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer you $6500 for the product. This allows you to make a sale today while giving me some savings compared to my alternative option. Would this work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your openness about your budget and preferences. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $6,500, as it's significantly lower than my valuation and the offer I have from another buyer. I'm willing to negotiate further, though. Would you consider raising your offer to $7,500? This way, we can both benefit from the transaction. Looking forward to your response."",

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price to $9000. That's a step in the right direction, but I'm still in a difficult position. As I mentioned, the product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and John is offering it at exactly $8000. I'd like to do business with you instead, but I can't justify paying more than the product's value to me. My best offer is $7500, which would save me some money compared to John's price while still giving you a sale today. If we can't reach an agreement at or below $8000, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer. What do you think?
