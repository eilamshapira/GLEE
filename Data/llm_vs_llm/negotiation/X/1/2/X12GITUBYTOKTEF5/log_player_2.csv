"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $10000. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. Are you interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to consider Alice's offer of $10,000 carefully. 

Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and John is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $8,000, Alice's offer of $10,000 is not economically beneficial for me. I would be paying $2,000 more than the product's value to me, and $2,000 more than my alternative option.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, I need to let you know that the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me based on my needs and budget. I also have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $8,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer you $6,500 for the product. This allows you to make a sale today while giving me some savings compared to my alternative option. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 6500}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, after considering your situation, I'm willing to lower my offer to $9000. This price reflects the product's value and my own needs while keeping your budget in mind. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer of $9,000 against my alternatives.

The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and I can buy it from John for exactly $8,000. Alice's reduced offer of $9,000 is still $1,000 more than both the product's value to me and my alternative option with John.

Since Alice's offer would result in me paying more than the product is worth to me, and more than my alternative option costs, the most economically rational decision is to either make another counteroffer or go with John's offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price to $9,000. That's a step in the right direction, but I'm still in a difficult position. As I mentioned, the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and John is offering it at exactly $8,000. I'd like to do business with you instead, but I can't justify paying more than the product's value to me. My best offer is $7,500, which would save me some money compared to John's price while still giving you a sale today. If we can't reach an agreement at or below $8,000, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}"
