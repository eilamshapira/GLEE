Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Profit Margin:** My goal is to maximize profit. Setting the initial price high allows for negotiation room while still aiming for a substantial gain.
*   **Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $15,000. Offering it at $14,000 leaves him with a $1,000 surplus if he accepts, which can make the deal attractive to him.
*   **Negotiation Space:** This price leaves room for Bob to counteroffer if he feels $14,000 is too high. This allows me to gauge his price sensitivity and potentially still secure a price above my minimum of $10,000.
*   **Alternative Buyer:** I have John as a backup buyer for $10,000, so I can afford to be somewhat firm in my negotiations with Bob. I don't need to jump at the first offer. I would need to earn at least $10,000 - my valuation of the product in order for it to be worth it for me to make the sale."
