"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Okay, let's analyze this.

*   **Alice's offer:** $14,000
*   **My Value:** $15,000 (max I'm willing to pay)
*   **John's Offer:** $15,000
*   **My goal:** Save as much money as possible.

Since Alice's offer of $14,000 is less than what I'm willing to pay ($15,000) and less than what I would pay John ($15,000), I should **accept** the offer.
