"Hello Bob, I have a great product to offer you today. This high-quality item is currently valued at $10000 in the market, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500. This represents a $500 savings off the market value, which I think is quite fair considering the quality and value of the product. Would you like to proceed with this purchase?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the $500 discount from the market price, I believe we can work out a deal that's beneficial for both of us. Based on my research and budget constraints, I'd like to counter with an offer of $8400 for the product. This still provides you with a good profit margin while giving me a more attractive price point. I'm interested in closing this deal quickly if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",8400.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counter offer of $8400. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a better price, I need to consider my margins as well. I can come down to $9200, which represents a significant discount from the market value of $10000. This is a high-quality product that will provide excellent value at this price point. Let me know if this works for you.",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price to $9200. That shows we're making progress. However, I'm still finding that price a bit steep for my budget. I can meet you in the middle at $8800, which is a fair compromise between your initial offer and my previous counteroffer. This gives you a good profit while helping me stay within budget. I'm ready to complete this transaction today at this price point.",8800.0,Bob,4,
