Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a great product to offer you today. This high-quality item is currently valued at $10,000 in the market, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the $500 discount from the market price, I believe we can work out a deal that's beneficial for both of us. Based on my research and budget constraints, I'd like to counter with an offer of $8400 for the product. This still provides you with a good profit margin while giving me a more attractive price point. I'm interested in closing this deal quickly if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counter offer of $8,400. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a better price, I need to consider my margins as well. I can come down to $9,200, which represents a significant discount from the market value of $10,000. This is a high-quality product that will provide excellent value at this price point. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 9200}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price to $9200. That shows we're making progress. However, I'm still finding that price a bit steep for my budget. I can meet you in the middle at $8800, which is a fair compromise between your initial offer and my previous counteroffer. This gives you a good profit while helping me stay within budget. I'm ready to complete this transaction today at this price point.
