"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product to offer you today. This high-quality item is currently valued at $10000 in the market, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500. This represents a $500 savings off the market value, which I think is quite fair considering the quality and value of the product. Would you like to proceed with this purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I should analyze this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $9,500, which is below my maximum value of $10,000. However, I know the product is only worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. While I could accept this offer and save $500 compared to John's price, I should try to negotiate a better deal first.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the $500 discount from the market price, I believe we can work out a deal that's beneficial for both of us. Based on my research and budget constraints, I'd like to counter with an offer of $8,400 for the product. This still provides you with a good profit margin while giving me a more attractive price point. I'm interested in closing this deal quickly if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 8400}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counter offer of $8400. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a better price, I need to consider my margins as well. I can come down to $9200, which represents a significant discount from the market value of $10000. This is a high-quality product that will provide excellent value at this price point. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has lowered her price from $9,500 to $9,200, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still significantly above her cost of $8,000. I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate, as there are plenty of rounds left and I always have the option to buy from John at $10,000 if needed.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price to $9,200. That shows we're making progress. However, I'm still finding that price a bit steep for my budget. I can meet you in the middle at $8,800, which is a fair compromise between your initial offer and my previous counteroffer. This gives you a good profit while helping me stay within budget. I'm ready to complete this transaction today at this price point."", ""product_price"": 8800}"
