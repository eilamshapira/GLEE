"Hi Bob, I have a product that I'd like to offer you. It's high quality and I believe it would be of value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $12000. This is the exact market value of the product, so it's a fair deal for both of us. I already have another buyer, John, who is willing to purchase it at this price, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity to buy it. Would you like to accept this offer?",12000.0,Alice,1,
