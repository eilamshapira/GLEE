"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I'd like to offer you. It's high quality and I believe it would be of value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $12000. This is the exact market value of the product, so it's a fair deal for both of us. I already have another buyer, John, who is willing to purchase it at this price, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity to buy it. Would you like to accept this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
