Send your offer to Bob.,"After considering the situation, I'll make an offer to Bob.

I know the product is worth $150 to Bob, which is his maximum valuation. Since I can always sell to John for $150 if Bob rejects my offer, I don't need to go below that amount.

While I could offer exactly $150 to Bob (which would make him indifferent between accepting and rejecting), I'll offer slightly above that to maximize my profit, understanding that Bob might reject it because it exceeds his valuation.
