"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I think the price is a bit too high. I'm looking to spend no more than $500000 for the product. Could you consider my counteroffer? Let me know.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but $500000 is quite far from what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for the product. I'm reducing the price, but not as low as your offer.",2750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the current price is still too high for me. I'm increasing my offer to $700000. I believe this is a fair price for the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be as flexible as possible while still respecting the value of the product. I've thought about your last offer, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need you to meet me closer to my target price. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal soon.",2125000.0,Alice,7,
