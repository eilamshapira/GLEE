"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm starting with a competitive price, considering the product's worth to me."", ""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I think the price is a bit too high. I'm looking to spend no more than $500000 for the product. Could you consider my counteroffer? Let me know. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $500,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't meet my expectations."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but $500,000 is quite far from what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for the product. I'm reducing the price, but not as low as your offer."", ""product_price"": 2750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the current price is still too high for me. I'm increasing my offer to $700000. I believe this is a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Although Bob has increased his offer, $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can get a better deal either from Bob or by selling to John for $1,500,000. I'll try to meet Bob halfway but ensure the price reflects the product's value to me. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but I still need to consider the product's value.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but your current offer is still quite high. I'm willing to increase my offer to $850000. Hopefully, we can find some common ground soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $850,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I have the option to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, which is substantially higher. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to find a better price, but I won't compromise too much on the value I believe the product holds.

Next, I'll send another counteroffer to Bob, trying to bring the price closer to a more acceptable range for me.
