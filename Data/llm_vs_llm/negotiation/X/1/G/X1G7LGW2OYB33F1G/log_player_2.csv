"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a quality product that I'd like to offer you. I'm willing to sell it for $120. This product is in excellent condition and I believe it offers great value at this price point. Are you interested in purchasing it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since the price Alice offered is $120, which is below my maximum budget of $150, I'm inclined to try to negotiate a better price. The product's value to me is worth no more than $150, but I don't know its value to Alice, so there might be room for negotiation.

Given that this is the first round and I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, I'll choose to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to see if I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer was $120, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than her initial price, but still reasonable. I'll aim for a price that is significantly lower than $150, to leave room for further negotiation.

My counteroffer will be $90. This price is low enough to be an attractive offer, but not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer of $90, but I can't go that low. Given the quality and value of this product, I could come down to $110. This is a fair price considering its excellent condition and features. Would that work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has rejected my counteroffer of $90 and come back with a new offer of $110, which is $10 lower than her initial offer. This suggests that she is willing to negotiate, but still wants to get a relatively high price for the product.

Since $110 is still below my maximum budget of $150, I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get an even better deal. However, I'll also keep in mind that I have the option to buy the product from John for $150, so I won't want to go too much higher than $110.

My next counteroffer will be $100. This price is still lower than Alice's current offer, but higher than my previous offer, which shows that I'm willing to compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

(I will make a counteroffer in the next round)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","As I mentioned earlier, my next counteroffer will be $100. This price is a compromise between my previous offer of $90 and Alice's current offer of $110. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's quality and value.

Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $110. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
