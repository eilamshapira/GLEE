"Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Considering its unique value and potential, I'm willing to offer it to you for a price of $1400000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1400000 is significantly above market value for this product. I know the product is valuable, but I'm working with a strict budget. I'm willing to offer $650000, which would allow you to make a quick sale while giving me some room in my budget. I should mention that I have another seller, John, offering the same product for $800000, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. However, considering the product's unique value, I can't go as low as $650000. However, to show my willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution, I'm willing to reduce the price to $1300000. This reflects the product's true worth and should still provide you with a significant return on investment.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you reducing your price, but $1300000 is still far above what I can justify paying. Based on my market research and the product's specifications, I'm willing to increase my offer to $750000. This is very close to my absolute maximum budget cap and represents a fair price that still gives you a reasonable profit. I should be transparent that John is offering the identical product for $800000, so I need a compelling reason to choose your offer over his. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but I cannot accept the offer of $750000. I also want to be transparent: I have another buyer interested in the product and am about to close a deal with them for $1000000. However, I value our potential relationship and am willing to make one last, very generous offer: $1200000. This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your mention of another buyer at $1000000, which helps clarify your position. However, I need to be direct - I simply cannot pay more than what the product is worth to me. My absolute maximum budget is $800000, which is exactly what John is offering me for the identical product. I'm willing to match that price and buy from you instead because I prefer to work with you, but I can't justify paying more. This is my final offer - $800000 - which is fair based on market value and my budget constraints. If we can't reach an agreement at this price point, I'll need to proceed with John's offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
