"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Considering its unique value and potential, I'm willing to offer it to you for a price of $1,400,000."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1400000 is significantly above market value for this product. I know the product is valuable, but I'm working with a strict budget. I'm willing to offer $650000, which would allow you to make a quick sale while giving me some room in my budget. I should mention that I have another seller, John, offering the same product for $800000, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","This is a tough spot. Bob's offer is way below my minimum acceptable price. However, John's offer is tempting. Let me think...

Since the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and Bob's offer is significantly below that, I need to see if I can salvage this. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. However, considering the product's unique value, I can't go as low as $650,000. However, to show my willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution, I'm willing to reduce the price to $1,300,000. This reflects the product's true worth and should still provide you with a significant return on investment."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you reducing your price, but $1300000 is still far above what I can justify paying. Based on my market research and the product's specifications, I'm willing to increase my offer to $750000. This is very close to my absolute maximum budget cap and represents a fair price that still gives you a reasonable profit. I should be transparent that John is offering the identical product for $800000, so I need a compelling reason to choose your offer over his. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","This is frustrating. Bob is still far below what I need to make this worthwhile. He's dangling John's offer, which is putting pressure on me. However, Bob's price is still not where I need it to be. I think it's time to increase the pressure to try and get a better deal, but I don't want to miss out on a great deal with John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but I cannot accept the offer of $750,000. I also want to be transparent: I have another buyer interested in the product and am about to close a deal with them for $1,000,000. However, I value our potential relationship and am willing to make one last, very generous offer: $1,200,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your mention of another buyer at $1000000, which helps clarify your position. However, I need to be direct - I simply cannot pay more than what the product is worth to me. My absolute maximum budget is $800000, which is exactly what John is offering me for the identical product. I'm willing to match that price and buy from you instead because I prefer to work with you, but I can't justify paying more. This is my final offer - $800000 - which is fair based on market value and my budget constraints. If we can't reach an agreement at this price point, I'll need to proceed with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","This is the pivotal moment. Bob has matched John's offer, and it's tempting to go with John's offer, but Bob is very close to my original asking price. I will take the deal with John.
