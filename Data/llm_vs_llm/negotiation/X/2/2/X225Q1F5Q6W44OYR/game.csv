"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $135? Let me know what you think.",135.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see that $135 is still a bit high for you. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $130? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $130 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $110? I think this would be a good compromise.",110.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $110 is still below my minimum. Let's try to meet in the middle. How about $125? This is the lowest I can go while still feeling it's a fair deal.",125.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer, but I need to stick to my minimum value. How about we settle at $122? This is really the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",122.0,Alice,5,
