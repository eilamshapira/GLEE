"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a lower price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate you coming up from your initial offer. Considering the product's value, I can't go down to $12,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for meeting me halfway, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a price of $11500, which I believe is a fair deal considering the product's value.

I'll reject Bob's offer and send a final counteroffer, but I'll be very close to my minimum this time.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my final counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the continued negotiations. I'm getting close to my bottom line. I can offer you the product for $12,500, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, considering what it's worth to you!"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, $12500 is still higher than I'm willing to pay. Since you mentioned you're close to your bottom line, I'd like to propose a price of $10500, which is very close to the product's value to you. I believe this is a fair compromise.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a tough decision. Bob is now offering $10,500. That's only $500 more than what I could get from John. I could try another counter offer, but I don't want to lose this deal if Bob walks away. Considering the time spent negotiating, I'll accept Bob's offer, it's better than selling it to John.
