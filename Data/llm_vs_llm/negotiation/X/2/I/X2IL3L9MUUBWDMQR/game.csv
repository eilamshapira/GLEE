"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, I must point out that your asking price of $1200000 is significantly above my budget. I have other options available at $1000000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider a price of $850000? This would be beneficial for both of us, as you'd still make a good profit, and I'd be able to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your prompt response and for sharing your concerns about the price. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, I must consider the product's value and the potential profit margin. Given the product's worth to both of us, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you the product for $1050000, which is still below my initial asking price but above your proposed price. I believe this is a fair offer, considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
