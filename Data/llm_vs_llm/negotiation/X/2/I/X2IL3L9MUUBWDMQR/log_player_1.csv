Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, I must point out that your asking price of $1200000 is significantly above my budget. I have other options available at $1000000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider a price of $850000? This would be beneficial for both of us, as you'd still make a good profit, and I'd be able to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
