"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will bring immense value to you. After careful consideration, I've set a competitive price for the product. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000), it would not be rational to accept this offer. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer, as there might be room for negotiation with Alice to get a better price than John's $1,000,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, I must point out that your asking price of $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I have other options available at $1,000,000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider a price of $850,000? This would be beneficial for both of us, as you'd still make a good profit, and I'd be able to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your prompt response and for sharing your concerns about the price. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, I must consider the product's value and the potential profit margin. Given the product's worth to both of us, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you the product for $1050000, which is still below my initial asking price but above your proposed price. I believe this is a fair offer, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than John's price of $1,000,000, and Alice has only moved down marginally from her initial offer, it makes more financial sense to purchase from John. While I attempted to negotiate with Alice, the current offer would mean paying $50,000 more than necessary. Therefore, I'll take the guaranteed option of buying from John at $1,000,000."
