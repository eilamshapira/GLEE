"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $9000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $10500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10500, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. Considering I have another option to buy the product from John for $10000, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10000. If you're willing to match that price, I'd be happy to buy from you instead.",10000.0,Bob,4,
