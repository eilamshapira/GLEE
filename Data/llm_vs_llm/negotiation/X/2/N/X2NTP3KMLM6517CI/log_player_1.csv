"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, I understand. My goal is to maximize profit while making sure I don't sell for less than $80. I'll start with a price that gives me a good profit margin but is still potentially attractive to Bob.

Here's my offer:

```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Okay, let's analyze this. Bob's offer is for $90. My cost is $80.

*   **Accept Bob's offer:** Profit of $10.
*   **Reject Bob's offer:** I risk getting a lower price in the next round or no sale at all.
*   **Sell to John:** Profit of $0.

Selling to Bob for $90 is the most profitable option at this point.
