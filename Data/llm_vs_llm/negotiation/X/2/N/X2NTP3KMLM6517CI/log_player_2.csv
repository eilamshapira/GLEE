(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Given that Alice's offer and John's price are both $150, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer or buying from John at this stage. I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price.
