"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product that has significant value. I'm pricing it at $1200000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $1,200,000, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,000,000.
