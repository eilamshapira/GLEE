Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my options carefully. 

The product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and I shouldn't sell it for less.
Bob values the product at only $800,000, which means he won't accept any offer above that amount.
I already have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay me $1,500,000.

Given these facts, it doesn't make economic sense to offer Bob a price below $1,500,000, since I would be losing money compared to selling to John. If I offer Bob any price above $800,000, he will reject it based on his valuation.

The rational decision is to make an offer that will likely lead to selling to John instead.
