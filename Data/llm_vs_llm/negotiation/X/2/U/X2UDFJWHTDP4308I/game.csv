"Thank you, Bob, for your offer. I understand that my initial price might have been a bit steep, but I believe the product's value lies closer to my first offer.

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While that price is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. I can offer $1000000.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $1000000 is a significant step up, and I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Considering your last offer and the product's value, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1250000. This price reflects a compromise between your offer and the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable midpoint.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your latest offer of $1125000. It shows you're committed to finding a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating to ensure we both get a fair deal. Considering your willingness to meet halfway and my previous offer, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000. This price is a slight adjustment from my last offer, taking into account your latest proposal and aiming to bridge the gap between us.",1200000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this is getting down to the wire for me. I can offer $1162500 as my final offer.  Let me know if this works for you.",1162500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer of $1162500. It's clear you're serious about acquiring the product. I've considered your proposal carefully, and while it's close, I was hoping we could meet at a slightly higher price. Given that this is one of our last opportunities to negotiate, I'm willing to make a small concession. I'll propose a counteroffer of $1175000. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, considering the product's value and our negotiations so far. If this works for you, I'm ready to close the deal.",1175000.0,Alice,9,
