Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us while aiming to get as close as possible to my initial offer or at least ensuring I don't go below the product's worth to me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you, Bob, for your offer.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While that price is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. I can offer $1000000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

I'll make another counteroffer. Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is getting closer to a reasonable price, but I still have room to negotiate and aim for a better deal. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob and $1,500,000 is also the price John is willing to pay, I'll try to meet Bob halfway between his last offer and the product's value to him."

Round 5

Your offer of $1,000,000 is a significant step up, and I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Considering your last offer and the product's value, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000.

Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming to get as much value as possible for the product. Since Bob is willing to meet me halfway and his latest offer is $1,125,000, I'll consider making a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my previous one but still higher than Bob's current offer, trying to find that sweet spot where both parties are satisfied."

Bob's final offer of $1,162,500 is very close to what I'm aiming for, but I still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000. Since this is the second to last round, I'll make one last counteroffer, trying to squeeze out a bit more value, but I need to be cautious not to lose the deal entirely. If Bob is unwilling to budge further, I have a safe fallback with John's offer."

I've considered your proposal carefully, and while it's close, I was hoping we could meet at a slightly higher price. Given that this is one of our last opportunities to negotiate, I'm willing to make a small concession. I'll propose a counteroffer of $1,175,000.
