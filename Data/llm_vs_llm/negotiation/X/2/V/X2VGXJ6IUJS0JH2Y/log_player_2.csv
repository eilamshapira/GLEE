"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's price ($1,200,000), and it's also my maximum limit, there's no advantage in continuing the negotiation. Even if I make a counteroffer, I have no leverage because I can't go higher than $1,200,000, and Alice knows I have an alternative at this price.
