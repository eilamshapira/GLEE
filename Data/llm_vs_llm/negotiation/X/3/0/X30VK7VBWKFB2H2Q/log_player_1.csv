Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to think about the best price to offer Bob.

Since the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, that's the maximum he would be willing to pay for it. If I offer exactly $10,000, Bob would be indifferent between accepting and rejecting (since he gets no surplus value).

I also know that if Bob rejects my offer, I'll sell the product to John for $10,000. This means I'm guaranteed $10,000 regardless.

Given this situation, it makes the most sense to offer the product to Bob at $10,000. There's no advantage to offering a lower price since I can get $10,000 from John, and offering higher than $10,000 would lead to a certain rejection from Bob.
