Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Considering the options:

*   **(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000:** This is far below my minimum and significantly undervalues the product.
*   **(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer:** This gives me a chance to get a better price.
*   **(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000:** This is a guaranteed sale at a price I'm comfortable with.

I choose to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Analyzing the options again:

*   **(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500:** Still below my minimum of $15,000.
*   **(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer:** Risky, as Bob's offers might decrease.
*   **(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000:** This is a guaranteed profit, and at a price I'm happy with.

This time I will take the sure deal with John.
