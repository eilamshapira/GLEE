"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The offer of $18,000 from Alice is significantly higher than John's fixed price of $10,000. Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and John is offering exactly that price, it makes the most economic sense to buy from John rather than accept Alice's high offer or enter into a negotiation that starts from such a high initial price."
