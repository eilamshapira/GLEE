"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000), it wouldn't be rational to accept her offer. The best option is to buy from John at $8,000.
