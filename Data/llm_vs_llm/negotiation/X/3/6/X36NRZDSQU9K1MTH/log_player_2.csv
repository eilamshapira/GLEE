"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I should analyze this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $100, which is $50 less than the $150 I could pay to John. Since my goal is to save money while buying the product, and $100 is well below my maximum value of $150, this is a good offer.
