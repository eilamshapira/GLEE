"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. While I've received another offer of $1500000 from a buyer named John, I wanted to give you the first opportunity to acquire it. Given its exceptional value and market demand, I'm offering it to you at $1500000. This represents the current market value that I've been offered elsewhere. Would you like to proceed with this purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
