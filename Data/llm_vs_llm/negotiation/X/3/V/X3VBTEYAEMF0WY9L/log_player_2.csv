"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000 is close to my maximum budget of $1,500,000 but still below it, and considering I have 10 rounds to negotiate, I think I can try to get a better deal. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to negotiate a lower price.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice's initial offer was $1,400,000 and considering her reserve price is $1,000,000, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than her initial offer but still reasonable, to leave room for further negotiation. A good starting point could be somewhere in the middle between Alice's reserve price and her initial offer.

My counteroffer would be $1,200,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has made a new offer of $1,350,000 after rejecting my counteroffer of $1,200,000. This indicates she is willing to negotiate but is not ready to go as low as I initially proposed. Her new offer is $50,000 less than her initial offer, showing some flexibility.

Considering I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate and my goal is to save as much money as possible, I think there's room for further negotiation. Alice's new offer of $1,350,000 is still below my maximum budget of $1,500,000, but I believe I can try to get an even better deal.

Therefore, I will reject Alice's new offer and proceed to make another counteroffer, aiming to meet somewhere in between her last offer and my previous counteroffer.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice's latest offer was $1,350,000 and my previous counteroffer was $1,200,000, I'll try to find a middle ground that is slightly more favorable to me than Alice's last offer but still shows a willingness to compromise.

A reasonable counteroffer could be $1,275,000, which is $75,000 less than Alice's current offer but $75,000 more than my previous counteroffer. This move indicates that I'm willing to negotiate and meet Alice halfway but still aims to save as much as possible.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,330,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,330,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has rejected my counteroffer of $1,275,000 and come back with a new offer of $1,330,000. This is a reduction of $20,000 from her previous offer of $1,350,000, indicating that she is still willing to negotiate but is getting closer to her limit.

Considering my goal is to save as much money as possible and I still have 6 rounds left, I think it's worth trying to negotiate further. However, I also need to be mindful of the time and the fact that Alice's offers are getting progressively closer to my maximum budget of $1,500,000.

Given that Alice's new offer is $1,330,000, I'm going to reject it and make another counteroffer. This time, I'll aim for a price that is slightly higher than my previous offer but still lower than Alice's current offer, to see if we can meet in the middle.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice's latest offer was $1,330,000 and my previous counteroffer was $1,275,000, I'll try to make a small concession to show that I'm willing to compromise. A reasonable counteroffer could be $1,300,000, which is $30,000 more than my previous offer but still $30,000 less than Alice's current offer.

This move aims to narrow the gap between our proposed prices and encourages Alice to consider meeting me at this midpoint. By making a small increase in my offer, I'm signaling that I'm serious about buying the product but still looking for the best possible deal.
