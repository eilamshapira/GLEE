Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

However, since Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, I'll reject and make another offer to try to get a better price.
