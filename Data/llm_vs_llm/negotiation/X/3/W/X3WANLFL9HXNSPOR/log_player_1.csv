"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significantly higher price than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation.  This initial offer:

* **Anchors:** It sets a high starting point, potentially influencing Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Signals Confidence:** A strong opening price suggests you believe in the product's worth.
* **Leaves Negotiation Space:** It gives you room to lower the price strategically while still aiming for a profitable outcome.

It's important to note that this is just the first move in a negotiation. Be prepared to adjust your approach based on Bob's response."
