"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm thrilled to be offering you this exclusive product. Based on its potential value, I'm willing to let it go for $2000000. This is a significant opportunity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
2. Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value
3. I have the option to buy from John for $800,000
4. Alice's initial offer is more than double my maximum value

I should definitely not accept Alice's offer of $2,000,000. Since her initial offer is so high, it suggests she might be starting with an extremely inflated price. While I could make a counteroffer, given that I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at exactly my maximum value ($800,000), it would be most rational to:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

This decision ensures I get the product at my maximum acceptable price without risking a prolonged negotiation that might not reach a better outcome."
