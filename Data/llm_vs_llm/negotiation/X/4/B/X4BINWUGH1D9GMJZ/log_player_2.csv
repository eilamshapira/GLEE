"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $180 is higher than both my maximum value ($150) and John's price ($150). It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer to Alice, as there's potential to get a better price than John's $150. If negotiations with Alice don't work out, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 120}

I'll offer $120, which is below John's price of $150. This gives room for negotiation while potentially saving money compared to John's offer. If Alice rejects this, we can still negotiate further, and I always have John's $150 offer as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's new offer ($160) is still above John's price ($150), and Alice has only dropped the price by $20 from her initial offer, it seems unlikely that she will go below John's price. Therefore, it's best to take John's offer of $150 rather than continue negotiating with Alice."
