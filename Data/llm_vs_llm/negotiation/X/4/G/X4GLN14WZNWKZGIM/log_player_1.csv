Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","I'll reject this offer since it's too close to John's price ($1,000,000) and I know the product is worth $1.5M to Bob. There's still room for negotiation to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from the initial $1.4M but still maintain a strong position, aiming for a price that gives both parties a reasonable share of the value difference between my minimum ($1M) and Bob's value ($1.5M).
