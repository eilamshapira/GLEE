"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a fair price.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $60 for the product. Let me know what you think.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $120 might be out of your budget, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a fair price for the product. Let's meet in the middle.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $100 is still above what I'm comfortable spending. How about we settle at $70? This is a fair increase from my last offer and still within my budget.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $70 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to sell the product for $90, which is a significant decrease from my initial offer. I think this price is reasonable, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $90. I understand you're trying to meet me halfway. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. How about $75? This is a bit higher than my last offer but still within my budget.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $75 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to sell the product for $85, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. I think this price is very reasonable, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",85.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, $85 is still a bit high for me. Let's try to close the deal at $80. This is the maximum I'm willing to spend, and it's a fair price considering our negotiations so far.",80.0,Bob,8,
