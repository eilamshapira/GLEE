"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a fair price."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $60 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $60 is too low for me, and I have the option to sell to John for $80 if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $120 might be out of your budget, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a fair price for the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $100 is still above what I'm comfortable spending. How about we settle at $70? This is a fair increase from my last offer and still within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Although Bob has increased his offer, $70 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I have the option to sell to John for $80, which is higher than Bob's current offer. I'll try to negotiate further to see if Bob is willing to meet me at a higher price. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $70 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to sell the product for $90, which is a significant decrease from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 90}"

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $90. I understand you're trying to meet me halfway. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. How about $75? This is a bit higher than my last offer but still within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Although Bob has increased his offer again, $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I have the option to sell to John for $80, which is higher than Bob's current offer. I'll try to negotiate further to see if Bob is willing to meet me at a higher price. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $75 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to sell the product for $85, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 85}"

Round 7

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, $85 is still a bit high for me. Let's try to close the deal at $80. This is the maximum I'm willing to spend, and it's a fair price considering our negotiations so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $80 is now equal to the price I can get from John, and since I've been negotiating with Bob for a while, I think it's reasonable to accept his offer. Accepting $80 from Bob allows me to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation not yielding a better price."
