"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique offering available today. I'd like to offer you this product for $15000. Please let me know if you're interested in moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Based on the information provided:

- The product is worth no more than $12,000 to you
- Alice is offering to sell it for $15,000
- John is willing to sell the same product for $12,000

Since Alice's offer ($15,000) exceeds both the product's value to you and John's alternative offer, the rational decision would be to buy from John.
