"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since Alice's offer ($11,000) is higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000), it would not be rational to accept her offer. The best decision would be to buy from John at $8,000, which matches my maximum value and saves me $3,000 compared to Alice's offer.
