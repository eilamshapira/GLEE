,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to be realistic about my budget. How about $5000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $5000 is far too low. The product's unique features and potential benefits justify a higher price. Let's try to find a middle ground. I can offer it to you for $16000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $16000 is still too high for my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $6500. I believe this is a fair offer considering the limitations I have.",6500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to make a significant move to meet you halfway. I can offer the product for $14000. I think this price reflects the value of the product and acknowledges your budget constraints. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for the movement on price, but the gap is still too wide for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8000, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a fair offer considering I could go with another seller at that price.",8000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, this is my absolute lowest offer: $12000. It reflects the rock-bottom price I can accept for this product. Please consider it carefully, as this is my final offer to you.",12000.0,Alice,7,
