"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique qualities and potential benefits for you, I believe it's truly a worthwhile investment. I'm offering it to you for $22000. I am confident that it would be a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me
2. Alice is offering the product for $22,000
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $10,000

The logical choice is to buy from John since:
- Alice's offer ($22,000) is significantly higher than my maximum valuation ($10,000)
- John's price ($10,000) matches my maximum valuation
- There's no reason to accept Alice's offer or negotiate further when I have a guaranteed better option
