"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality, my budget is a bit tight. I'd be more comfortable at $120. Are you able to accommodate that?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $120 is too low for this product's value. I understand budget constraints, but I need to ensure a fair price for both of us. I can come down to $200. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, considering the product's quality and market value.",200.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks, Alice, for adjusting the price. I do recognize the value, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $140? I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
