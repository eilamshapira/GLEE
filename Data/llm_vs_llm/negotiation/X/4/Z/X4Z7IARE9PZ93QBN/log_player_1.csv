"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $250. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality, my budget is a bit tight. I'd be more comfortable at $120. Are you able to accommodate that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I have several rounds left to negotiate, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'll try to meet somewhere in the middle, but still above my minimum threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $120 is too low for this product's value. I understand budget constraints, but I need to ensure a fair price for both of us. I can come down to $200. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, considering the product's quality and market value."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks, Alice, for adjusting the price. I do recognize the value, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $140? I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll choose to sell to John for $150. Bob's latest offer of $140 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and while we could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Bob will increase his offer significantly. John's guaranteed $150 offer is better than risking further negotiations that might not exceed this amount. Additionally, this saves time and ensures I get my minimum acceptable price."
