"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its exceptional features and value, I'm pricing it at $17500. This represents an excellent investment opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. I'm willing to negotiate, but buying from John for $10,000 is my backup plan if I can't get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $9,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to see how much Alice is willing to move on the price. There's a chance she finds this unreasonable, but it leaves me room to negotiate upwards."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $9000 is significantly below its actual value. The product has substantial worth, and I cannot go below $15000. This is already a reduced price from my initial offer, considering the quality and features of what you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

While Alice moved a bit,  $15,000 is still too high. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a viable alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product has value, but $15,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could we meet somewhere around $11,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering the market value."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

I'm raising my offer significantly to show Alice I'm serious, but I'm still staying below my maximum budget. I want to nudge her closer to a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer of $11000, but I need to be transparent with you. The product is worth at least $12000 to me, which is the absolute minimum I can accept. In fact, I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay exactly $12000. I'd prefer to do business with you, but I cannot go below $13000 and still maintain a reasonable profit margin. This is my best offer considering the circumstances. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

This is getting interesting. Alice mentioning another buyer named John seems like a tactic to pressure me, especially since I have the option to buy from a John at a lower price. I suspect she might be bluffing about the other offer. I'll keep negotiating, but I won't go above my $11,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your position, but I have to be honest, $13,000 is pushing my budget. I'm still willing to pay $11,000, and I believe that's a very fair price. If that doesn't work for you, I understand, but I may have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

I'm holding firm at $11,000 and subtly hinting that I might walk away if she doesn't budge. It's a risk, but I need to see if she's willing to come down further."
