"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a truly exceptional product here that I believe could be transformative for you. I'm offering it to you for $2500000. It's a significant investment, I understand, but the potential return is enormous. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Based on the information provided:

1. The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to you.
2. Alice is offering the product for $2,500,000.
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $1,500,000.

Since Alice's offer ($2,500,000) exceeds the maximum value the product has to you ($1,500,000), and there's an alternative seller (John) offering exactly at your maximum value, the logical choice is to buy from John.
