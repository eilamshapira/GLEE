Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about the optimal price strategy here:

1. The product is worth $150 to Bob
2. My minimum acceptable price is $100
3. I have a guaranteed backup offer of $100 from John
4. Bob will likely reject if the price is too close to $150

Given these factors, I should offer a price that gives Bob some surplus value but still maximizes my profit. A price around $125-130 would split the difference between Bob's valuation ($150) and my minimum ($100), making it attractive enough for Bob while giving me a good profit.
