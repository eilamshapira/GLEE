Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm very excited to offer you this unique product. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to offer it to you for a price of $1,450,000."", ""product_price"": 1450000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1450000 is quite close to market price. Given that this is a direct sale, I believe a more reasonable price would be $1300000, which would still provide you with a good profit margin. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Okay, Bob's counteroffer is $1,300,000. I need to decide whether to accept it, reject it and counter, or sell to John.

Considering my minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000, and Bob's offer is above that, I need to consider my negotiation strategy. I still have a good potential profit margin if I sell to Bob. I believe that there might be room to negotiate a bit further, so I will reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""reason"": ""I believe I can get a slightly better price from Bob through further negotiation.""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your perspective, I believe the product is worth more. However, I am willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,400,000. This offers you significant savings and provides me with a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
