"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have an excellent opportunity for you to acquire the product you've been interested in. Considering its value and the benefits it will bring to you, I'm offering it at a price of $950000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it still leaves you with a substantial benefit compared to its full value. I look forward to finalizing this deal with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","To make a decision, let's analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth $1,000,000 to me.
2. Alice's offer is $950,000.
3. If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000.

Given that Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than the product's worth to me ($1,000,000), and it's also less than what I would pay if I were to buy from John, accepting Alice's offer seems like the best option financially. It saves me $50,000 compared to buying from John.

Therefore, my decision is:
