"Alice, while I see the value in your product, $2100000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1700000 for it. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its market value.",1700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $1700000 is a step in the right direction, given the product's value and features, I can offer it at $1900000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial price and reflects my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1800000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
