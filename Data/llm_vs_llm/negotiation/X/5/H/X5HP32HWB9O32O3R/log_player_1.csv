"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be beneficial for you. Given its market value and unique features, I'm offering it at $2,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth and potential value to your business."", ""product_price"": 2100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I see the value in your product, $2100000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1700000 for it. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. While $1,700,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, there's still room for negotiation. Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, and since we're only in round 2 of 10, we have time to find a better middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $1,700,000 is a step in the right direction, given the product's value and features, I can offer it at $1,900,000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial price and reflects my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1800000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,800,000. This is a good price that's significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 (what John is offering), and Bob has shown that this is likely his best offer given the modest increase from his previous bid. Further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether, and $1,800,000 represents a good profit margin."
