Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me make an initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to him and $1,200,000 to me, I'll start with a high price to leave room for negotiation while trying to maximize my profit.

{""product_price"": 1,400,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is only slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 (John's offer), and significantly below what the product is worth to Bob ($1,500,000). I believe there's room for negotiation to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a new counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from the initial $1,400,000, but still aim for a good profit margin considering Bob values the product at $1,500,000.

{""product_price"": 1,350,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob has increased his offer to $1,280,000, which is $30,000 more than his previous offer. While this is moving in the right direction and is better than John's offer of $1,200,000, I think we can still negotiate for a better price given that the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price further but still maintain a good margin. I'll try to meet Bob closer to the middle between his last offer and my previous one.

{""product_price"": 1,320,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob has increased his offer to $1,300,000, which is a decent improvement from his previous offer of $1,280,000. While we could potentially continue negotiating, there's also a risk that Bob might get frustrated and walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $1,200,000. The current offer represents a good profit margin ($100,000 more than John's offer), and continuing to negotiate for small increments might not be worth the risk.
