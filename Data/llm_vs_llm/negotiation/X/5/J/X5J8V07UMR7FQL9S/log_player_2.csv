"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to consider whether to accept Alice's offer of $1,400,000, make a counteroffer, or buy from John for $1,500,000.

Since the product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $1,400,000, I'm already saving $100,000 compared to buying from John. However, I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so there's room to negotiate for a better price.

It makes sense to reject Alice's initial offer and make a counteroffer, as this could potentially save me more money. John's offer serves as my fallback option if negotiations with Alice fail.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but still gives me a better deal than Alice's initial offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has come down from her initial offer of $1,400,000 to $1,350,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is already $150,000 less than John's price, but I believe there's still room for negotiation since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer to show I'm negotiating in good faith, but still aim for a price that's favorable to me.

{""product_price"": $1,280,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has reduced her offer again from $1,350,000 to $1,320,000, which shows continued willingness to negotiate. She's gradually moving down toward my offers, and this current offer saves me $180,000 compared to John's price.

I think there's still room to negotiate for a slightly better price, so I'll make one more counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer further to show I'm serious about reaching an agreement, moving closer to Alice's last offer.
