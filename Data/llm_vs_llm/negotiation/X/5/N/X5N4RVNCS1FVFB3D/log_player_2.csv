"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds immense value, potentially exceeding $1500000.  I'm confident that this product could be a game-changer for you.  I'm willing to let it go for $2000000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm sure you'll find it to be a great investment.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Looking at Alice's offer, I need to consider my options carefully:

1. Alice is offering the product for $2,000,000
2. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me
3. John is willing to sell me the same product for $1,200,000

Since Alice's price ($2,000,000) exceeds both the product's value to me and John's alternative offer, the rational choice is to buy from John for $1,200,000.
