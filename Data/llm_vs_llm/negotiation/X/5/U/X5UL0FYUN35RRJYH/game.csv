Based on my understanding of its market value and potential benefits to you, I'm offering it at $1300000.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1300000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1050000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest and counteroffer. I appreciate your position, but I need to be transparent that $1050000 is too close to my minimum acceptable price. I have another potential buyer at $1000000, but I'd prefer to work with you. I can come down significantly from my initial offer to $1225000, which represents a substantial value for you given the product's worth of $1500000 to your business. This gives you $275000 in value while still being fair to me. Would you consider this revised offer?",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I understand you have other potential buyers, I'm serious about purchasing this product, but only at the right price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1150000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
