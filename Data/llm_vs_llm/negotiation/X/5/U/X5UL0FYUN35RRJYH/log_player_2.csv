Based on my understanding of its market value and potential benefits to you, I'm offering it at $1300000. This price represents a fair value considering the product's worth, while still allowing you room for profit. I look forward to your response.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest and counteroffer. I appreciate your position, but I need to be transparent that $1050000 is too close to my minimum acceptable price. I have another potential buyer at $1000000, but I'd prefer to work with you. I can come down significantly from my initial offer to $1225000, which represents a substantial value for you given the product's worth of $1500000 to your business. This gives you $275000 in value while still being fair to me. Would you consider this revised offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

Alice is clearly trying to anchor the price at a higher point by mentioning another buyer and inflating the product's worth to me.  I still have room to negotiate downwards."
