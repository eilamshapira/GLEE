"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think about this strategically. Alice's initial offer is $150, which is exactly the same as John's price and equal to my maximum valuation. Since there's no difference between Alice's price and John's price, and there's potential to negotiate a better deal with Alice in future rounds, I should try to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice started at $150, I'll make a significantly lower counteroffer to leave room for negotiation. I'll start at about 60% of her initial offer.

{""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has reduced her price by $10, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This new offer of $140 is better than John's price of $150, but there might still be room for further negotiation since we have several rounds left.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice came down from $150 to $140, showing some flexibility. I'll increase my previous offer of $90 but still try to get a better deal. I'll split the difference between my last offer ($90) and her current offer ($140).

{""product_price"": 115}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has reduced her price again to $135, which is $15 less than John's price. She's showing consistent willingness to negotiate downward, but the decrements are getting smaller. While we could continue negotiating, there's also a risk she might not go much lower, and we're already getting a good deal compared to John's price. At this point, I think it's wise to accept this offer.
