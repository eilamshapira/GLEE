"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Okay, let's analyze the situation:

*   **Alice's Offer:** $14,000
*   **My Value:** $15,000 (maximum I'm willing to pay)
*   **John's Offer:** $15,000

Since I can buy the product from Alice for $14,000, and it's worth it to me (less than my $15,000 limit), I should **AcceptOffer**.

So the answer is:

```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```"
