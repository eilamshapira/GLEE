"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I believe it's a valuable item, but the price of $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6000, considering my budget and the potential benefits of the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $6000 is far below what I can accept for this product. My initial price reflects its true value. I am willing to come down a bit, and offer it to you for $17000.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17000 is still out of my budget. I'm looking for a more reasonable price. Considering my previous offer and your counteroffer, I'd like to propose a compromise at $7000. This is closer to my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I also have a minimum price I can accept. Let's try to meet in the middle a bit more. How about $16000?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, $16000 is still significantly above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my means. I'd like to propose $7500, which is the highest I'm comfortable going. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",7500.0,Bob,6,
