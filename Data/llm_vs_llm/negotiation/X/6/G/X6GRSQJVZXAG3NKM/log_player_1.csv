Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob, hoping to leave room for negotiation. I'm confident in my product's value and believe I can secure a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for such a significant loss. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to the product's value. I believe $900,000 is a fair compromise and should be attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better than his previous one, it's still too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but selling to John for $1,000,000 is still a more appealing option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway. $800,000 is a fair price, considering Bob's valuation and my desire to make a profit. If he rejects this offer, I'll be forced to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $730,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $730,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached my limit with Bob. This negotiation has taken too long, and I'm not confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures I get a good deal and avoid further delays."
