Alice's offer is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay and what John is offering. I'll counteroffer with a much lower price to see if there's any room for negotiation."

This is a starting point for negotiation. While it's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, it allows room for us to potentially meet in the middle."

While Alice came down significantly, $900,000 is still a long way from my initial offer. I believe there's still room for negotiation before resorting to John's offer."
