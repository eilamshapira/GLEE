"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $25000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, $10000 is still below my expectations. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you the product for $22000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. I'm open to further negotiations, but I believe this price is more reasonable.",22000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $22000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price for the product. Considering your offer of $15000, I'm willing to make a small compromise. I can offer you the product for $20000, which is still a good deal for both of us. If this price doesn't work for you, I'm open to further negotiations.",20000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price. I'm willing to go up to $17000, but that's my final offer.  If it's not acceptable, I'll need to consider buying from John.",17000.0,Bob,6,
