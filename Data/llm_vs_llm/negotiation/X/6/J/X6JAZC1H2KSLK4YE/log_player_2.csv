"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer and make a decision that maximizes my value.

Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, but the product is only worth up to $800,000 to me. If I accept Alice's offer, I would be paying $200,000 more than the product's value to me.

John is willing to sell me the same product for $800,000, which is equal to the maximum value the product has for me.

Since paying $1,000,000 would exceed the product's value to me, and I have a better alternative available, the rational choice is to buy from John.
