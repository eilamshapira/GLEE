Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. His offer of $1,100,000 is better than my fallback option of selling to John for $1,000,000, but I believe there's still room to negotiate a better price.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","I notice Bob continues to decrease his offer each round, which is concerning. He's gone from $1,100,000 to $1,080,000 and now to $1,070,000. This pattern suggests he might continue lowering his offers, potentially approaching or even going below my guaranteed option with John ($1,000,000). 

While Bob's current offer is still better than John's, I'll make one final attempt at a reasonable compromise.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob continues the pattern of decreasing his offer with each round. At this point, I'm concerned that if I reject this offer, his next offer might be even lower. Since his current offer of $1,050,000 is still better than John's guaranteed $1,000,000, and we're already in round 8 of 10, I'll accept this offer.
