"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Based on the given information, I'll analyze the options:

1. Alice's offer: $10,000
2. John's offer: $8,000
3. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me (Bob)

Since the product is only worth up to $8,000 to me, paying $10,000 would be a loss. John is offering exactly what the product is worth to me at maximum.

The best decision is to buy from John for $8,000, as this meets my goal of acquiring the product while saving as much money as possible.
