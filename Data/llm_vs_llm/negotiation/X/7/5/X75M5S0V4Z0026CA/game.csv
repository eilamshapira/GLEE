"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1100000. This price reflects the product's true worth while still leaving room for you to generate value from the purchase. Would you be interested in proceeding with this offer?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice, but I believe we can find a more suitable price for both of us. How about a counteroffer of $950000 for the product?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, I believe we can find a middle ground that works better for both of us. Given the product's value and potential, I'm willing to adjust my initial price to $1025000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true worth. Would this work for you?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, Alice. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both sides considering our previous discussions.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your latest offer. However, I feel we're still a bit far from a price that reflects the product's true value and potential. I'm willing to come down to $975000, which represents a significant compromise from my initial position. This price point would create value for both of us. Would you be willing to meet me at this number?",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I appreciate your offer of $975000, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of $875000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that considers our earlier discussions.",875000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued engagement in our negotiation. While I understand your position, I notice we're moving further apart rather than closer together. Let's try to find a final compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $950000 - this is my final offer and represents a substantial discount from my initial price. This price point would still allow you to generate significant value while being fair to both parties. Would you be willing to meet me at this number?",950000.0,Alice,7,
