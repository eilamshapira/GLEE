Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice, but I believe we can find a more suitable price for both of us. How about a counteroffer of $950000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. While $950,000 is better than selling to John, there's still room for negotiation given that the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. I believe we can find a middle ground that benefits both parties."

I'll make another counteroffer. Bob's offers are trending downward, and while $875,000 is still better than John's $800,000, we should try one more time to reach a more favorable agreement. The significant gap between Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) and his current offer suggests there's still room for negotiation."
