"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for a special price. Would you like to buy it for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer is exactly at my maximum budget of $120, and buying from John would cost the same, I might as well buy from Alice as it saves me the trouble of going to John.
