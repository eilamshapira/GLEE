Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm getting closer to my budget limit, but I'm still interested in the product. I'd like to propose a price of $115, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If we can't meet at this price, I'll likely need to explore other options, including purchasing from John for $150. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I've decided to accept Bob's offer of $115. Although it's still a bit lower than my initial target, it's a reasonable compromise considering the negotiation process. Additionally, selling to John for $80 is not a favorable option, and I believe $115 is a fair price given the circumstances."
