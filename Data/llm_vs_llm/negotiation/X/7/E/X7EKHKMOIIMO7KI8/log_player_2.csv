"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $950,000
3. John is willing to sell it for $800,000

Since Alice's offer ($950,000) is:
- Higher than my maximum value ($800,000)
- Higher than John's offer ($800,000)

The logical choice is to buy from John, as it:
- Saves me $150,000 compared to Alice's offer
- Matches my maximum valuation of the product
