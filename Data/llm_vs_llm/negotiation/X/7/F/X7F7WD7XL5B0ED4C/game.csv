"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1500000 is significantly above my budget. I've researched the market, and I know I can get this product elsewhere for $1000000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $800000 for the product? This would give you a quick sale, and I could complete the purchase immediately.",800000.0,Bob,2,
