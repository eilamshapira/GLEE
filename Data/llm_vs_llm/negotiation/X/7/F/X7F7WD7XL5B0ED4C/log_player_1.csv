"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1500000 is significantly above my budget. I've researched the market, and I know I can get this product elsewhere for $1000000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $800000 for the product? This would give you a quick sale, and I could complete the purchase immediately. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
