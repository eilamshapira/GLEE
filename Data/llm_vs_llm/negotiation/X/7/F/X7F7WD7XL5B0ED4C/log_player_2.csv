"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a valuable product that I'm offering. I believe it could be a great addition for you. I'm open to discussing the price to find something that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: The offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's alternative price ($1,000,000). It wouldn't make sense to accept this offer when I can either:
1. Make a counteroffer to try to get a better price from Alice
2. Buy from John at $1,000,000 if negotiations with Alice don't work out

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I've researched the market, and I know I can get this product elsewhere for $1,000,000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $800,000 for the product? This would give you a quick sale, and I could complete the purchase immediately."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Reasoning: I'm starting with a counteroffer that's:
1. Below John's price of $1,000,000 to give room for negotiation
2. Significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to anchor the negotiation at a lower price point
3. Includes mention of the alternative option (without directly mentioning John) to strengthen my negotiating position
4. Maintains a professional and cooperative tone while emphasizing quick completion as a benefit"
