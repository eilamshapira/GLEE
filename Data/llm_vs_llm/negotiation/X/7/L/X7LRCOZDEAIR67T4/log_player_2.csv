"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: $9,500
2. Reject Alice's offer (which means I would buy from John for $10,000)
3. Buy from John for $10,000

Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $9,500 is less than John's price of $10,000, I should accept Alice's offer to save $500.
