Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my options carefully here. The product is worth at least $150 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150. Bob values it at only $120, which is less than my minimum acceptable price.

Since Bob values the product at $120, he won't accept any offer above $120. And since I can sell to John for $150, there's no reason for me to offer a price below $150 to Bob.

Given these constraints, I should make an offer to Bob that respects his decision-making ability while protecting my economic interests.
