"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to consider the offer carefully. 

Alice is offering the product for $15,000, but the product is only worth $12,000 to me. This means I would be paying $3,000 more than the product's value to me. Additionally, I know that John is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $12,000.

Since Alice's first offer is higher than both my valuation and John's alternative price, it makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but leaves room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": $9,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has lowered her offer from $15,000 to $14,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this offer is still $2,000 higher than what the product is worth to me and $2,000 higher than John's price of $12,000.

Since I can buy the product from John for exactly $12,000, which matches my maximum valuation, there's no reason to accept an offer that's higher than that.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $10,500}"

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her offer to $13,500, which shows she's continuing to negotiate. However, this is still $1,500 more than both my maximum valuation for the product and John's offer of $12,000.

Since I can purchase the product from John for exactly my maximum valuation of $12,000, there's no logical reason to accept Alice's current offer which exceeds that amount.

I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.

Round 6

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has now lowered her offer to $13,000, which shows she's continuing to negotiate downward. However, this is still $1,000 more than my maximum valuation for the product and $1,000 more than John's offer of $12,000.

Since I can still purchase the product from John for exactly $12,000, which matches my maximum valuation, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer which exceeds that amount.

I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating, but we're getting closer to a potentially acceptable price.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has now lowered her offer to $12,500, which is getting closer to my maximum valuation. However, this is still $500 more than my maximum valuation for the product and $500 more than John's offer of $12,000.

Since I can purchase the product from John for exactly $12,000, which matches my maximum valuation, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer which exceeds that amount.

At this point, given that we've had several rounds of negotiation and Alice is still above John's price, I'll choose to buy from John instead of continuing with another round of negotiation.
