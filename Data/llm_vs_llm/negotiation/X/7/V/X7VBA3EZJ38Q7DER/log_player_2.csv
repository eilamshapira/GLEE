"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1800000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(Let's start with a lower counteroffer and see how Alice responds. Since the product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, I'll begin with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.)

Counteroffer: $800,000"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price point that is more aligned with my budget. I'd like to offer $800,000 for the product."",""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for proposing your price.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value significantly surpasses your offer. I'm open to negotiating, so I'm proposing $1500000.  This price reflects a substantial reduction on my part while acknowledging the product's inherent worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(Alice's counteroffer is still too high. I'll make another counteroffer that is closer to my maximum valuation but still lower than John's price.)

Counteroffer: $1,000,000"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I understand your position, Alice, but I need to manage my budget carefully. I'm willing to raise my offer to $1,000,000. This price seems more reasonable to me while still recognizing the product's value."",""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually agreeable price. To demonstrate my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to lower my price to $1300000. I believe this represents a significant concession on my part while still reflecting the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

(Alice's offer is still higher than John's price. It's better to buy from John at this point.)"
