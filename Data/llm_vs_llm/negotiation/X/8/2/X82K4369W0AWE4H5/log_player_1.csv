Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is above my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. My counteroffer will be $18,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. However, $18000 is still above my budget. How about we settle on a price of $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob, as $11,000 is still below my desired price. My counteroffer will be $16,000, which is slightly above the price I can get from John, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to consider a lower price, but I need to ensure I get a fair deal. I can offer the product to you for $16,000. If you're interested, please let me know."", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $16000 is still more than I'm willing to spend. Would you accept $10500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob, but since $10,500 is still below my desired price and close to the price I can get from John, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly above the price I can get from John. My counteroffer will be $15,500.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm getting close to my limit. I can offer the product to you for $15,500, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. If you're interested, please let me know."", ""product_price"": 15500}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $15500 is still higher than my budget. How about we agree on $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Since Bob's offer of $12,500 is still lower than the $15,000 I can get from John, and I've already made several concessions, I think it's best to sell the product to John for $15,000. This ensures I get a better price than Bob's current offer."
