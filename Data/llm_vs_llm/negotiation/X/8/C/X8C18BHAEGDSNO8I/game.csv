"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8000 for the product, considering my budget and other available options.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $8000 as it's significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to work with you, but I need to be transparent - I have another buyer willing to pay $15000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a fair agreement. My new offer is $15500, which is much closer to the market value.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your transparency about the other buyer. However, I still believe $15500 is above my budget. Considering your willingness to work with me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $9500. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
