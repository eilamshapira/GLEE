Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $17,500. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value."", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8000 for the product, considering my budget and other available options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer to Bob. The product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Since John is willing to pay $15,000, I have no reason to accept an offer below that amount. I'll try one more negotiation round with Bob, but if we can't reach an agreement, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $8,000 as it's significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to work with you, but I need to be transparent - I have another buyer willing to pay $15,000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a fair agreement. My new offer is $15,500, which is much closer to the market value."", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your transparency about the other buyer. However, I still believe $15500 is above my budget. Considering your willingness to work with me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $9500. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer of $9,500 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and John is willing to pay $15,000, it makes the most financial sense to sell to John. Bob's budget constraints mean we're unlikely to reach an agreement that works for both parties, as the product is worth $10,000 to him, so he won't go above that amount. Therefore, I'll take John's guaranteed offer of $15,000."
