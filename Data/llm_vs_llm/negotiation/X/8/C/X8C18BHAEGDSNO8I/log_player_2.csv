Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $8000 as it's significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to work with you, but I need to be transparent - I have another buyer willing to pay $15000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a fair agreement. My new offer is $15500, which is much closer to the market value.
