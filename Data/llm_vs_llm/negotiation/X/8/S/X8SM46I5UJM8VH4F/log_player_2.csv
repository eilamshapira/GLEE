"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to consider my options carefully here.

Alice is offering the product at $100, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay.
I know the product is worth $80 to Alice, meaning she has room to lower her price.
John is also selling at $100, so I have no advantage in buying from him right now.

The best strategy is to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This gives me an opportunity to potentially save money.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has come down $5 from her initial offer of $100 to $95, which is a small move in the right direction. However, since I know the product is worth $80 to her, there's still room for negotiation. The $95 offer is better than John's $100 offer, but I should try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a better price.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has come down from $95 to $92, which shows she's willing to negotiate further. Since the product is only worth $80 to her, there's still some room for negotiation. Her offer of $92 is already better than John's $100 offer, but I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a better price before accepting.
