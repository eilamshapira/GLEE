I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation but still gives me a significant profit. Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, I'm holding out for a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. I'm not comfortable dropping my price that much further.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,000,000.  While it's not my ideal outcome, it's better than risking a long, drawn-out negotiation with Bob that might not lead to a satisfactory result."
