"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

You're not getting a better price from Alice, and John will sell you the product for the same price.  Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and going with John makes sense."
