Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Considering my options:

*   **Accepting Bob's offer ($7,500)** is lower than what the product is worth to me and below what John will pay.
*   **Rejecting and counteroffering** might lead to a better price with Bob, but there's a risk of the negotiation failing.
*   **Selling to John ($8,000)** guarantees me a profit that is worth more than what Bob is offering.

Therefore, I will choose to sell to John.
