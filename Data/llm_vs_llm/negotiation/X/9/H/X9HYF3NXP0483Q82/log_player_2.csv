"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let's analyze the situation:

*   **Alice's Offer:** $950,000
*   **Your Value:** $1,000,000 (maximum you'd pay)
*   **Alice's Value:** $800,000
*   **John's Offer:** $1,000,000

Considering the options:

*   **(1) Accept Alice's offer:** You buy for $950,000.
*   **(2) Reject Alice's offer and counteroffer:** This opens the door to potentially getting a lower price from Alice, but it also carries risk. Alice might not budge much, or the negotiation could fail.
*   **(3) Buy from John:** You pay $1,000,000.

Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to you and Alice offers the product for $950,000, it makes sense to accept the offer, since it's less than the product worth to you.
