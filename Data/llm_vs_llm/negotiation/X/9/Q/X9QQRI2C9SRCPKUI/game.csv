"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $20000 for it. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the value.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price seems a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $5000 for the product.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $5000 is significantly below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $17000 to meet you halfway.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit out of my price range. How about $7000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I understand you're looking for a good deal, $7000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. To demonstrate my willingness to compromise further, I'm willing to drop my price to $12000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to keep a decent profit.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but I need to stay within my budget.  Would you consider $7500?",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're just going in circles here.  $7500 is still too far below what I need to sell for.  I'm willing to come down to $10000.  This is my final offer, and I'm not sure I can go any lower.  It's up to you now.",10000.0,Alice,7,
