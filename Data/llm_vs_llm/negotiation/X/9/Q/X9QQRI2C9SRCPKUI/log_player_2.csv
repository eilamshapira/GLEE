Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $5000 is significantly below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $17000 to meet you halfway.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I understand you're looking for a good deal, $7000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. To demonstrate my willingness to compromise further, I'm willing to drop my price to $12000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to keep a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're just going in circles here.  $7500 is still too far below what I need to sell for.  I'm willing to come down to $10000.  This is my final offer, and I'm not sure I can go any lower.  It's up to you now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It seems unlikely Alice will go below $8000.  It's time to take John up on his standing offer."
