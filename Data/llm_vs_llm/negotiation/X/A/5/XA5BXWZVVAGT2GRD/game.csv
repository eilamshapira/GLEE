"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I know that the product is available from other sellers for $80. Since that's my maximum budget for this item, I can offer you $70 for it. This gives you a quick sale while allowing me to save a bit compared to my alternative option. Would that work for you?",70.0,Bob,2,
