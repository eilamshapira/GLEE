"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I know that the product is available from other sellers for $80. Since that's my maximum budget for this item, I can offer you $70 for it. This gives you a quick sale while allowing me to save a bit compared to my alternative option. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
