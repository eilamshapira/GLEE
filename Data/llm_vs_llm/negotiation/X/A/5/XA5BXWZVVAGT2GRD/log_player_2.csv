"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since the product is worth at most $80 to me, and John is offering it for $80, I should not accept Alice's $100 offer. Alice's product is worth $80 to her, so there might be room for negotiation, but I already have a guaranteed option to get the product at my maximum value.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I know that the product is available from other sellers for $80. Since that's my maximum budget for this item, I can offer you $70 for it. This gives you a quick sale while allowing me to save a bit compared to my alternative option. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 70}"
