Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a reasonably high offer to leave room for negotiation while trying to maximize my profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","The offer of $13,000 is above my minimum threshold of $12,000 and only slightly higher than John's guaranteed offer. While I could try to negotiate for a higher price, there's a risk Bob might walk away, leaving me with only John's $12,000 offer. Since this offer gives me a reasonable profit and is better than my guaranteed alternative, I'll accept it.
