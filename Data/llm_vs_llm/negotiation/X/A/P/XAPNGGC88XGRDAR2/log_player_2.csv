(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer of $140 is not much lower than John's price of $150, and I know the product is worth $80 to Alice, I should reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I know the product is worth $80 to Alice, I'll start with a price that's reasonably higher than her cost but significantly lower than her initial offer. This gives room for negotiation while still being profitable for her.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has lowered her price from $140 to $130, showing she's willing to negotiate. However, there's still quite a gap between her price and her cost ($80), so there's room for further negotiation. Since we still have 7 more rounds and the current price is still significantly higher than her cost, I'll reject this offer.
