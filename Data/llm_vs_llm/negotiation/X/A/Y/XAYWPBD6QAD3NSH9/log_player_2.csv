"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'm looking for $120, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'm rejecting the offer because Alice's price of $120 is at the upper limit of what I'm willing to pay, and I'd like to see if I can get a better deal. Since the product is only worth $80 to Alice, I'm hoping she may be willing to negotiate and lower the price if I reject her initial offer."
