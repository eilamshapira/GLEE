,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price point that is more aligned with my budget. I am willing to offer $400000 for the product.",400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I must point out that $400000 is significantly below its market value. The product is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase at that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $1800000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer and reflects the true value of what you'd be acquiring.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1800000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $500000 to meet you in the middle.",500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but I need to be transparent that $500000 is still well below what I can accept. As I mentioned, I have John ready to purchase at $1000000, which represents my absolute minimum selling price. I value the possibility of doing business with you, so I'm willing to offer you the product at $1400000 - a price that still represents significant value given its potential returns. If we're too far apart on price expectations, I understand, but I can't go below what the product is objectively worth.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your transparency. However, $1400000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $600000, which I believe is a fair price for the product.",600000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand budget constraints, but I need to be clear that I cannot sell below $1000000, which is the minimum value of this product to me. In fact, John is ready to purchase at exactly that price. I've come down significantly from my initial asking price, and in the interest of potentially working with you, I can offer $1200000 as my final price. This is my best possible offer and represents a $300000 reduction from my previous offer. If this is still beyond your budget, I completely understand, but I'll need to proceed with John's offer.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
