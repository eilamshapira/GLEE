"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer! However, $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $6000 for the product. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your response! While I understand your budget constraints, $6000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell the product for $10000. Let me know if that works for you!",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price, but $10000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $7000? I think that's a fair price considering my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I appreciate your position. How about I lower the price to $9500? I believe this is a fair compromise. Looking forward to your response!",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle, but $9500 is still beyond what I'm willing to spend. Could we go down to $7500? I believe this would be a good deal for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your continued interest! I understand your budget concerns. How about we settle on $8500? This is a reasonable price for both of us, and I hope it works for you!",8500.0,Alice,7,
