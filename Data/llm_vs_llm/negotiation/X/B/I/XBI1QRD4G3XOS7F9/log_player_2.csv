"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given that Alice is offering the product for $120, which is the same price as John's offer, and knowing that the product is worth $100 to Alice, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. There's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice since she has room for profit even at a lower price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $100 to Alice, and I know she has room to negotiate, I'll start with a reasonable counteroffer that gives her some profit while being significantly better than the $120 price point.

{""product_price"": 108}

This offer gives Alice an $8 profit margin while saving me $12 compared to both Alice's initial offer and John's price. It's a fair starting point that shows I'm willing to give Alice a reasonable profit while also looking out for my own interests."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has come down to $110, which is a significant improvement from her initial $120 offer. This price is also $10 better than John's price. While we might be able to negotiate further, the risk of losing this deal and having to pay $120 to John isn't worth the potential small additional savings. Alice has made a reasonable concession, and $110 is a fair price that gives both parties a good outcome.
