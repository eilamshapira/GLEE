"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $12,000, it doesn't make economic sense to accept her offer. John is offering the same product for $8,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay.
