"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is the best option. Here's why:

* **Accepting Alice's offer** means you pay $1,400,000, saving you $100,000 compared to John's offer. 

While rejecting Alice's offer might seem like it could lead to a better deal, there's no guarantee of that, and you risk ending up with John's less favorable offer."
