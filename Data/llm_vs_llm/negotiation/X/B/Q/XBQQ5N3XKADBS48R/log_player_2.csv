"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1100000. I know it holds significant value for you, and I believe this price reflects its worth while still being a fair deal for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below this threshold, it's a good deal. Additionally, buying from John would cost me $100,000 more, which I can save by accepting Alice's offer.
