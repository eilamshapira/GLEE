"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your alternative option (John's price). You should definitely try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer allows room for negotiation. It's possible Alice values the product much lower than her initial offer, and this counter-offer could be a good starting point to uncover her bottom line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still significantly higher than your alternative with John.  Continuing to negotiate is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice reducing her price by $200,000 suggests a willingness to negotiate. This counter-offer is a significant increase from our previous offer, showing movement towards a potential agreement, but still well below both her current offer and John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer, but her price is still $400,000 more than John's offer. It's worth one more counter-offer to see if she'll come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**  This offer shows continued movement towards a compromise while still leaving room for negotiation before reaching John's price. A smaller increase this round might incentivize Alice to settle closer to our offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, we're now at a point where the potential savings are smaller than the risk of pushing her away. It's time to get more aggressive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:** This offer is a significant jump from our previous offer, signaling that we're serious about getting closer to John's price. It puts the pressure on Alice while still leaving some room for negotiation if she's entirely unwilling to go that low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and the potential savings of another round of negotiation are now outweighed by the risk of her withdrawing the offer entirely.  It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed price from John."
