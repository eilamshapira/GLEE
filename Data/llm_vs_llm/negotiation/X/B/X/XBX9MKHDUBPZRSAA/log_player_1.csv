"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product, I'll start by making a relatively high offer. This will give me room to negotiate and potentially settle on a higher price.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I also have the option to sell it to John for the same price, I don't see any benefit in accepting Bob's offer at this point. I'd like to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $12,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, my counteroffer will be slightly lower than my initial offer to show that I'm willing to negotiate, but still higher than Bob's offer to try to get a better price.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer of $14,000 is higher than my minimum acceptable price and also higher than John's offer. Since I'm trying to earn as much money as I can for the product, I'll consider this a good offer. However, I'll try to squeeze out a bit more if possible.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $14,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than his offer, but not so high that it would be unreasonable. This will give me a chance to negotiate a better price while still being realistic about the potential sale.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer of $15,000 is a significant increase from his previous offer, and it's a good price for the product. Considering that I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the sale, I think it's a good idea to accept this offer.
