"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $12000. I believe it's a fair price, but I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's opening offer is my maximum budget. There's no point in accepting it as I might be able to get a better price. I will reject and counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 8000
}
```

I'm starting with a significant counter-offer to gauge Alice's potential flexibility. This leaves room for negotiation while still being a price I'd be happy with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of a mutually beneficial price. Considering the product's worth, I'd like to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but I still think there's room to haggle.  I'll reject and propose a counter-offer a bit closer to her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $9,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
 ""product_price"": 9000
}
```

I'm moving closer to Alice's offer to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price that's significantly lower than her initial offer and John's alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I think we're getting close to a deal. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'd like to meet you halfway again, this time between your offer of $9000 and my previous offer of $10000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

While $9,500 is getting tempting, I'm going to push just a little bit further. I'll reject and propose a final offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, you've been great to negotiate with.  Let's make this our final exchange - how about $9,200 and we close the deal?"",
 ""product_price"": 9200
}
```

This offer is a strong compromise that should be appealing to Alice while still saving me a good amount of money. By framing it as a final offer, I'm hoping to encourage a quick decision."
