"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $1,500,000
2. Alice's offer is $1,200,000, which is $300,000 less than my maximum value
3. John's fixed price is $1,500,000
4. I still have 9 more rounds of negotiation possible
5. Since Alice's first offer is already significantly below my maximum value, I could try to negotiate even lower

Given that Alice's initial offer is already good ($300,000 below my maximum), I could try to negotiate for an even better deal. Since I have many rounds left and a guaranteed fallback option with John, it's worth trying to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice opened with $1,200,000, I'll try to negotiate significantly lower while still being reasonable. I'll propose $900,000, which is $300,000 less than her initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation while still being a credible offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","This is an excellent development:

1. Alice has reduced her price from $1,200,000 to $1,000,000
2. This is now $500,000 below my maximum value
3. The negotiation is moving in a favorable direction
4. This is a substantial price reduction, showing Alice is willing to negotiate significantly

Given that Alice has made such a substantial reduction in price ($200,000 less than her initial offer), and this price is very favorable compared to my maximum value and John's price, I should accept this offer. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of losing this very good deal.
