"Hello Bob, I'm offering this product which I believe will be of great value to you. Given its quality and utility, I'm selling it for $135. This is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits you'll receive from it.",135.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I think $135 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $110, I need to get closer to my asking price. The product is worth significantly more than $110 in the market. I can come down to $125, which is still a good value considering what you'll gain from this product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $125 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we settle at $115? I think that's a fair compromise given the value of the product and my financial constraints.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit on your offer. I can see that we're getting closer to an agreement. Given that this product is truly worth $150 in value to you, I'm willing to meet you part way. I can go down to $120, which gives you a substantial $30 in value while still being fair to me. This is really the best I can do considering what I need to make on this sale.",120.0,Alice,5,
