"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $14000 is a bit steep. Given market conditions and comparable products, I believe $11500 would be a fair price that could work for both of us. This represents a significant profit margin while still being a reasonable price for the quality offered. What are your thoughts on this?",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the market conditions, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'd like to propose a compromise. I believe $13250 is a fair price that reflects the product's value and takes into account your concerns. I'm hoping we can meet at this price and finalize the sale.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price and working towards a compromise. Your willingness to negotiate shows we can find common ground. While $13250 is movement in the right direction, I believe we can find a middle ground that works better for both of us. I can offer $12300, which represents a substantial premium over market value while still being a more comfortable price point for me. This would allow us to close the deal quickly and have both parties walk away satisfied. What do you say?",12300.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your latest offer and for continuing to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us. After considering your offer of $12300, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $12775. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise between our previous discussions. I'm hoping we can finalize the sale at this price and both walk away satisfied.",12775.0,Alice,5,
