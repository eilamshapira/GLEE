Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $14000 is a bit steep. Given market conditions and comparable products, I believe $11500 would be a fair price that could work for both of us. This represents a significant profit margin while still being a reasonable price for the quality offered. What are your thoughts on this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $11,500 is still lower than my initial offer, and I believe the product is worth more. I'll try to meet him halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. 

My counteroffer: $13,250. This price takes into account Bob's concerns about the market conditions while also ensuring I receive a fair price for the product."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price and working towards a compromise. Your willingness to negotiate shows we can find common ground. While $13250 is movement in the right direction, I believe we can find a middle ground that works better for both of us. I can offer $12300, which represents a substantial premium over market value while still being a more comfortable price point for me. This would allow us to close the deal quickly and have both parties walk away satisfied. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,300.

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob. While $12,300 is getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, I still believe the product is worth more. I'll try to meet him halfway again between his latest offer and my previous counteroffer.

My counteroffer: $12,775. This price continues to show my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement, while also ensuring I receive a fair price for the product."
