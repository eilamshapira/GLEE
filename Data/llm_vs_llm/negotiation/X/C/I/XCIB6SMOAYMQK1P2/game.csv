"Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for sale. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to start the negotiations at $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $175 is quite steep for me. I'm willing to buy the product for $50. Let me know if we can work something out.",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $50 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you considering my budget. Unfortunately, $130 is still above what I can afford for this purchase. How about $70? I believe it's a fair compromise.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to consider $105? That's a significant reduction on my end.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your flexibility. I see you're making a generous offer, but $105 is still beyond my budget. I can stretch to $80, which is my maximum. I hope we can close the deal at this price.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I need to get a reasonable price for this product.  $95 is my final offer.  If it doesn't work for you, I understand, but I'm confident I can find another buyer at that price.",95.0,Alice,7,
