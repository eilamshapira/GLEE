Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it at $12,000, which I think is a fair price considering its quality and value."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $12000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $6000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $6,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 (which I can get from John), I reject this offer. I will make a new counteroffer to Bob in the next round, potentially coming down from my initial $12,000 but ensuring it stays above $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I understand $12,000 is above your budget. However, $6,000 is too low for the value of this product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $10000 is still a bit high for me. I can go up to $7000. This is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's final offer of $7,000 is still below what John is willing to pay ($8,000), and Bob has indicated this is his final offer, it makes the most financial sense to sell to John. There's no reason to accept less than what I can definitely get from John, and continuing negotiations with Bob seems unlikely to yield a better result given his ""final offer"" stance."
