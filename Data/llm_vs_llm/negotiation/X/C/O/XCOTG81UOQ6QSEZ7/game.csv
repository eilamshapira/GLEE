"Bob, I'm excited to present you with this unique opportunity. This is a truly exceptional product, and I believe it holds significant potential value for you. Given its rarity and the benefits it offers, I'm initially offering it for $2500000. Let me know what you think.",2500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but I think $2500000 is quite steep. I'm looking to spend no more than $1200000. Let's start at $800000 and see if we can find some middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1500000. However, I am willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle between my initial offer and your offer? I'll offer it to you for $1650000. This is a substantial reduction and I believe represents a fair price for both of us.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1650000 is still quite high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I hope it shows my genuine interest in the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $900000. I'm still quite a ways away from that number. My absolute rock-bottom price is $1500000, as I have another buyer willing to pay that. However, because I prefer to sell to you, I am willing to come down slightly to $1575000. This is my final offer before selling to the other buyer. This is a one-time offer.",1575000.0,Alice,5,
