Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but I think $2500000 is quite steep. I'm looking to spend no more than $1200000. Let's start at $800000 and see if we can find some middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. However, I am willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle between my initial offer and your offer? I'll offer it to you for $1,650,000. This is a substantial reduction and I believe represents a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1650000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1650000 is still quite high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I hope it shows my genuine interest in the product.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $900,000. I'm still quite a ways away from that number.
