Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1500000. However, I am willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle between my initial offer and your offer? I'll offer it to you for $1650000. This is a substantial reduction and I believe represents a fair price for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $900000. I'm still quite a ways away from that number. My absolute rock-bottom price is $1500000, as I have another buyer willing to pay that. However, because I prefer to sell to you, I am willing to come down slightly to $1575000. This is my final offer before selling to the other buyer. This is a one-time offer.
