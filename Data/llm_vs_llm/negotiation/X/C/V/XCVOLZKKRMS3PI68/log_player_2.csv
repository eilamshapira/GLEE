"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let's analyze the situation:

*   **Alice's Offer:** $14,000
*   **Your Valuation:** $15,000 (Maximum you're willing to pay)
*   **John's Offer:** $15,000
*   **Rounds Remaining:** 10

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Accepting Alice's Offer:** This is the most straightforward option. You get the product for $14,000, which is less than your maximum willingness to pay.
2.  **Rejecting Alice's Offer:** There's room for negotiation. You might be able to get a lower price from Alice in the following rounds, but there's also a risk that Alice might raise the price in the next rounds. You want to minimize the cost and maximize your savings.
3.  **Buying from John:** This is the worst option in this round. You can get the product for cheaper by accepting Alice's offer.

**Decision:**

I will **accept Alice's offer** because it is cheaper than buying the product from John.
