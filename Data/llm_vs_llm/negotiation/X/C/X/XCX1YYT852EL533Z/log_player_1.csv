"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I know my product is worth at least $1,000,000 and I have John's guaranteed offer as a backup, I'll start with a high offer to test Bob's willingness to pay.

{""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","I will reject Bob's offer of $500,000 as it is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Since I have John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000, there's no reason to accept anything lower.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's initial offer was quite low at $500,000, but he's still engaged in negotiations, I'll reduce my initial price somewhat but still maintain a strong position above my minimum acceptable price.

{""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer of $750,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Since I have John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000, and Bob's offers aren't approaching this minimum threshold quickly enough given we're already in round 4, I'll choose to end the negotiation and sell to John.
