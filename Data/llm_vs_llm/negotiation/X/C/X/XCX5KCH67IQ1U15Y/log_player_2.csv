"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you would be very interested in. It's currently priced at $14000, which is a significant discount from its true value. I know this product is worth $8000 to you, so this is a great opportunity to acquire something valuable at a lower price. Let me know if you're interested!   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what you could get it for from John.  You should reject the offer and see if Alice will come down to a more reasonable price."
