Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider the situation carefully. I know the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and it's worth $1,200,000 to Bob. If Bob rejects my offer, I can sell to John for $1,500,000.

Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, he won't pay more than that amount. If I offer the product at exactly $1,200,000, Bob should theoretically accept since he would break even. However, in real negotiations, buyers typically want to gain some value.

Given that I have a guaranteed backup option with John at $1,500,000, there's no incentive for me to sell to Bob for less than that amount. Since Bob can't match this price (as it exceeds his valuation), I should proceed with my best alternative.
