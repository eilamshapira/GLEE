"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Based on the information provided, Alice's offer is $1,500,000, which is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay (since the product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me). Meanwhile, John is offering the same product for $1,200,000.

The logical choice would be to buy from John since his price is $300,000 less than Alice's offer, and exactly matches the maximum value of the product to me.
