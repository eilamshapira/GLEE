"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer was $2,500,000, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower, but still shows that I'm interested in the product. I'll offer $800,000, which is below my maximum budget of $1,200,000.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $800000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down from my initial offer. How about $2200000? That's a considerable reduction, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice reduced her price from $2,500,000 to $2,200,000, which is a significant decrease. However, it's still above my budget of $1,200,000. I'll try to meet her halfway between her new offer and my previous counteroffer.

Her previous offer was $2,200,000, and my previous counteroffer was $800,000. The midpoint of these two prices is ($2,200,000 + $800,000) / 2 = $1,500,000. However, since I want to save as much money as possible, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than the midpoint.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.
