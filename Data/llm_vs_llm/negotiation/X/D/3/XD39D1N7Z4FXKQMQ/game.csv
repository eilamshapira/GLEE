"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe the price of $2100000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I'd like to make a counteroffer. Based on my research and considering the product's value to my business, I'm willing to pay $1200000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, I must inform you that I have another buyer willing to pay $1500000 for the product. That said, I value the potential for a business relationship with you and would be willing to sell the product for $1800000, which is significantly lower than my initial offer. This price still reflects the product's true value while offering you a better deal than my first proposal.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer and for considering our potential business relationship. I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, I still believe that $1800000 is above my budget for this product. Given that you mentioned another buyer is willing to pay $1500000, I'd like to make a counteroffer that's closer to that price. I'm willing to pay $1450000, which I believe is a fair and competitive offer. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
