Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe the price of $2100000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I'd like to make a counteroffer. Based on my research and considering the product's value to my business, I'm willing to pay $1200000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 (which is what John is willing to pay), but I still see potential for negotiating with Bob to reach a better price than John's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, I must inform you that I have another buyer willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. That said, I value the potential for a business relationship with you and would be willing to sell the product for $1,800,000, which is significantly lower than my initial offer. This price still reflects the product's true value while offering you a better deal than my first proposal."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer and for considering our potential business relationship. I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, I still believe that $1800000 is above my budget for this product. Given that you mentioned another buyer is willing to pay $1500000, I'd like to make a counteroffer that's closer to that price. I'm willing to pay $1450000, which I believe is a fair and competitive offer. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John since his offer of $1,500,000 is higher than Bob's counteroffer of $1,450,000. While I appreciate Bob's negotiation, there's no reason to accept less than what John is willing to pay, and continuing negotiations might not lead to a better outcome."
