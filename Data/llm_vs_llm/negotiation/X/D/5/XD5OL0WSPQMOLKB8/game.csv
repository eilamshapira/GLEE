"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $1150000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $1050000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1100000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $1075000?  I think this price reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a good deal for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
