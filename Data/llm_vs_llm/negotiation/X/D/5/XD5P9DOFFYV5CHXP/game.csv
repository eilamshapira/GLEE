"Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $150. This is a fair price for the value you'll receive. Are you interested in purchasing at this price?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $80 for the product. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $80 as the product is worth at least $100 to me based on its quality and market value. I can come down to $130, which is a fair discount from my initial offer. Does this work better for you?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $130 is still above what I'm comfortable spending. Could you consider going down to $90? I think that would be a fair compromise given my budget constraints.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be clear that my absolute minimum is $100 for this product, which is actually the same price another buyer (John) is already willing to pay. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer it at $115, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. This is really the best I can do given the product's value.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the further discount. However, $115 is still a bit high for me. Since you mentioned that your absolute minimum is $100, I'd like to offer $100 for the product. This way, you meet your minimum, and I stay within my budget. What do you say?",100.0,Bob,6,
