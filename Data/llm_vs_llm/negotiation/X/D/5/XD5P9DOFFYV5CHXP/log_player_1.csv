Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3

I understand budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $80 as the product is worth at least $100 to me based on its quality and market value.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
