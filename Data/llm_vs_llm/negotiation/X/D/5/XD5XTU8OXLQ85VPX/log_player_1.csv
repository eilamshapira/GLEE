Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the premium quality of your product, I have to be mindful of my budget constraints. Your offer of $2500000 is significantly above what I can justify for this purchase. I have another offer from John for $1200000, which is my maximum budget for this product. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find common ground. Would you consider a price of $900000? This would allow me to choose your product while staying within my financial parameters. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. However, I need to clarify something important - you mentioned that John offered you this product for $1,200,000, but John has actually agreed to purchase it from me for $1,000,000, not sell it to you. This indicates the market value is certainly above your offer of $900,000. The product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know its true value in the market is considerably higher. Given these circumstances, I can reduce my initial price to $1,600,000, which represents a significant discount from my original offer while still reflecting the product's genuine worth. I'm interested in doing business with you, but I need the price to properly reflect the value you'll receive."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your response, Alice. I think there's a misunderstanding - John is a different seller who is offering to sell the same product to me for $1200000, not buying from you. That price represents my absolute ceiling for this purchase based on the product's value to my business. I understand you need to make a reasonable profit, but $1600000 is still significantly above my maximum budget. I can increase my offer to $1050000, which acknowledges the product's market value you mentioned while still keeping the purchase economically viable for me. This is a substantial increase from my initial offer and reflects my genuine interest in doing business with you rather than John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
