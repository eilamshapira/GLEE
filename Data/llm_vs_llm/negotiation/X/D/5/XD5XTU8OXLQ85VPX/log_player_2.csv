Your offer of $2,500,000 is significantly above what I can justify for this purchase. I have another offer from John for $1,200,000, which is my maximum budget for this product. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find common ground. Would you consider a price of $900,000?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. However, I need to clarify something important - you mentioned that John offered you this product for $1200000, but John has actually agreed to purchase it from me for $1000000, not sell it to you. This indicates the market value is certainly above your offer of $900000. The product is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I know its true value in the market is considerably higher. Given these circumstances, I can reduce my initial price to $1600000, which represents a significant discount from my original offer while still reflecting the product's genuine worth. I'm interested in doing business with you, but I need the price to properly reflect the value you'll receive.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your response, Alice. I think there's a misunderstanding - John is a different seller who is offering to sell the same product to me for $1,200,000, not buying from you. That price represents my absolute ceiling for this purchase based on the product's value to my business. I understand you need to make a reasonable profit, but $1,600,000 is still significantly above my maximum budget. I can increase my offer to $1,050,000, which acknowledges the product's market value you mentioned while still keeping the purchase economically viable for me. This is a substantial increase from my initial offer and reflects my genuine interest in doing business with you rather than John."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
