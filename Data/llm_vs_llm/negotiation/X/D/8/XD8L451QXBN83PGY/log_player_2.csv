"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a high-quality product that I'm currently selling. I'm looking to sell it for $12000. This product offers excellent value and I believe it would be a worthwhile investment for you. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's see if we can get a better price.

**Counteroffer:**
Hey Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I'm looking to spend less. Would you be willing to sell the product for $10,000?"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I'm looking to spend less. Would you be willing to sell the product for $8,000?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand you're looking to spend less, $8000 is actually my absolute minimum price point as I have another buyer, John, willing to pay that amount. Given the quality and value of this product, I can come down to $11000, which I believe is quite reasonable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's counteroffer with a price lower than $11,000 but higher than my previous offer of $8,000.

**Counteroffer:**
Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still looking to spend less. Would you consider selling the product for $9,500?"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, would you consider selling the product for $9500? I think this price takes into account the product's value and my budget. I'd appreciate it if you could meet me at this price."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
