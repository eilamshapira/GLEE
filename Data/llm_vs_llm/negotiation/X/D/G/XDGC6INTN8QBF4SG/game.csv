"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $2000000. What do you say?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to buy the product for $900000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $900000 is below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to lower my price to $1800000, considering your budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1800000 might still be a stretch. How about we meet at $1500000? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it represents a fair value for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price. However, $1500000 is still above my target budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $1050000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm looking forward to your response.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. While I appreciate your willingness to increase your budget, $1050000 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let me know if this works for you.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1300000? This is a further reduction from my last offer, and I believe it's a price that reflects the value of the product while considering your budget constraints.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $1300000 is closer to my target, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $1100000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the reductions you've already made, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand we're getting closer, but $1100000 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to lower my price to $1250000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering both our needs. Let me know if this works for you.",,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet in the middle. Let's try to close the gap further. How about we settle at $1225000? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a price that reflects the value of the product while considering your budget constraints.",1225000.0,Alice,7,
