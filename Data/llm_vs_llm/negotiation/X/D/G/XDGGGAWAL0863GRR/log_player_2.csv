You have three options:

While Alice's offer matches your maximum price, there's a chance to negotiate a better deal.  It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
``` 

This is a classic negotiation tactic - starting with a significantly lower offer to gauge Alice's flexibility.  It's possible Alice has a high margin and is willing to go much lower, especially if they want to close a deal quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

This is a good price, saving $30 from John's price and representing a successful negotiation. There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, so it's best to accept and secure the deal."
