"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is less than your $1,000,000 maximum, you know John will sell it for even less. Rejecting this offer gives you the chance to get a better deal."
