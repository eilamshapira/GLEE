Considering that I can sell the product to John for $15,000, which is higher than Bob's current offer, I will consider this option. However, I will give Bob one more chance to increase his offer.

My counteroffer will be $16,500.

Given that Bob's offer is only $1,000 less than the minimum value I can get from John, and I have limited rounds left, I will reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price from him.

My counteroffer will be $15,500.
