"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is lower than the minimum value of $1,500,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $1,500,000, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I will also not sell it to John immediately, as there's a possibility that Bob might increase his offer in the next round. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

My counteroffer to Bob is $2,500,000."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still lower than the minimum value of $1,500,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $1,500,000, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I notice that Bob has increased his offer from $1,000,000 to $1,200,000, which suggests that he is interested in the product and may be willing to pay more. 

I will reject Bob's offer and consider making another counteroffer, but I will also keep in mind the option to sell to John if the negotiation with Bob does not yield a satisfactory price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

My next step would be to make another counteroffer to Bob, but I would like to adjust my strategy to try to meet Bob's price more closely while still aiming to get the best possible deal.

My counteroffer to Bob is $2,000,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

However, I notice that Bob has increased his offer again, which suggests that he is still interested in the product.

At this point, I am not making progress towards my goal of selling the product for a high price, and Bob's offers are not getting close enough to my minimum acceptable price. Given that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000, which is higher than Bob's current offer, I will choose to sell the product to John.
