"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price of $2700000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000, considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget considerations, I need to clarify that the product has a minimum value of $1500000 to me. This reflects its quality, capabilities, and market value. I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial offer to $2000000, which represents a $700000 reduction. This is a fair price considering the product's attributes and long-term value. I hope we can find common ground that works for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate the reduction from the initial price. However, $2000000 is still above my budget. Considering your mentioned minimum value of $1500000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000, which is the highest I'm willing to pay. This is also the price at which I can buy the product from another seller, so it's a competitive offer.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
