Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget considerations, I need to clarify that the product has a minimum value of $1500000 to me. This reflects its quality, capabilities, and market value. I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial offer to $2000000, which represents a $700000 reduction. This is a fair price considering the product's attributes and long-term value. I hope we can find common ground that works for both of us.
