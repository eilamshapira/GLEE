"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $2,500,000 is more than twice the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,200,000), it's not a good deal for me. I'd like to try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000, I'll offer half of that amount to see how Alice responds.

{""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,950,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. While it's a decrease from her initial offer, it's not enough to make it a good deal for me. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $1,950,000, and I previously offered $600,000, I'll try to meet her halfway. However, I'll also keep in mind that my maximum budget is $1,200,000, so I won't go too high. I'll offer $900,000, which is still below my budget, but shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable price.

{""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,700,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. However, I notice that she's decreasing the price with each round, which suggests that she's willing to negotiate. Since I've already offered $900,000 and she rejected it, I'll try to split the difference between my previous offer and her new offer. But before I do that, I'll consider the option to buy from John, which is still available to me at $1,200,000. Given that Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's price, I think it's time to consider walking away from the negotiation with Alice.
