"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $500,000 is lower than the minimum value of $800,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $800,000, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I will also not sell it to John immediately, as there's a possibility that Bob might increase his offer in subsequent rounds. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

My counteroffer to Bob is $900,000."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $750,000 is still lower than my previous counteroffer, but closer to the minimum value that I consider acceptable ($800,000), I need to weigh my options carefully. Accepting Bob's offer would mean selling the product for less than I ideally want, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. Rejecting Bob's offer and making another counteroffer risks him walking away, especially since he knows I have the option to sell to John for $800,000. Selling to John for $800,000 is a safe option but doesn't maximize my potential earnings if Bob is willing to pay more.

Given these considerations, I will reject Bob's offer of $750,000 because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and I believe there's a chance Bob might increase his offer further, closer to or even above my initial asking price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

My next counteroffer to Bob will be $850,000, trying to meet him halfway between his last offer and my previous counteroffer, while also testing his willingness to pay closer to my desired price.
