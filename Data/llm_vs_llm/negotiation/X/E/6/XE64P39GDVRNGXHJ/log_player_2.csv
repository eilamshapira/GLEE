"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is above my maximum budget of $800,000, it doesn't make sense for me to accept this offer. Additionally, buying from John for $800,000 is my maximum budget, so I'd like to try to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price below $800,000. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm trying to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a relatively low offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $900,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000. While it's closer than her initial offer, I'm not willing to pay more than $800,000 for the product. Since buying from John for $800,000 is still an option, I don't feel pressured to accept Alice's offer.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and consider making another counteroffer, but I'm also getting closer to just buying from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer is $900,000 and I'm trying to get as close to $800,000 as possible, I'll make a counteroffer that splits the difference between my previous offer and Alice's current offer, but still slightly favors my target price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $850,000 is very close to my maximum budget of $800,000, but still slightly above it. At this point, I have to consider whether the potential benefits of buying from Alice outweigh the extra $50,000 cost.

However, since buying from John for $800,000 is still an option, and it's within my budget, I think it's the better choice. I don't want to spend more than I have to, and $50,000 is a significant amount.
