"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's offer is $950,000
2. The product is worth $800,000 to Alice
3. My maximum value for the product is $1,000,000
4. John's fixed price is $1,000,000

Alice's offer of $950,000 is high, especially knowing that the product is worth $800,000 to her. There's room for negotiation since she has a $150,000 margin between her cost and her offer. 

Buying from John at $1,000,000 would be the worst option as it's the highest price.

The best strategy would be to reject this offer and make a counteroffer closer to Alice's cost, as there's potential to save more money through negotiation.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Let me make a strategic counteroffer:

Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, and she offered $950,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but still gives me good savings. I'll offer $850,000, which:

1. Gives Alice a $50,000 profit margin above her value
2. Saves me $150,000 compared to John's price
3. Is low enough to leave room for negotiation if Alice counters
4. Is high enough to be taken seriously

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:

1. Alice reduced her price from $950,000 to $900,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. This $900,000 offer gives her a $100,000 profit margin over her cost ($800,000)
3. It saves me $100,000 compared to John's price ($1,000,000)
4. The price movement ($50,000 reduction) suggests we might be getting closer to a middle ground

This is actually a pretty reasonable offer. While there might be a small room for further negotiation, the risk of prolonging negotiations might not be worth it because:
1. Alice might get frustrated and stop negotiating
2. We've already achieved a significant reduction from the initial offer
3. $900,000 represents a good compromise between her cost and my maximum value
