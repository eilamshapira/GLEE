"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $170 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. $80 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $150?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $150 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a bit more than my previous offer, how about $90? It's a fair price, and I think it's a good compromise.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget. However, I can't go that low. My absolute lowest price is $140. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,5,
