"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me think about this. Alice is offering the product for $950,000, which is significantly less than John's price of $1,500,000. This is a good initial offer since it's well below my maximum value.

I could try to negotiate further by rejecting and making a counteroffer, but there's a risk that the price could increase in subsequent negotiations. Since this first offer is already 37% below my maximum willingness to pay, it seems like a very reasonable deal.
