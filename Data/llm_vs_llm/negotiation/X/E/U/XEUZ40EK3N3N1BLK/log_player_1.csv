"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since the product is worth $100 to me and only $80 to Bob, I know he won't pay more than $80. However, I can always sell to John for $100. I'll start high to test Bob's response.

{""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since I can sell to John for $100, and Bob's offer of $75 is well below my minimum value of $100, there's no reason to accept his offer or continue negotiating. The best decision is to sell to John.
