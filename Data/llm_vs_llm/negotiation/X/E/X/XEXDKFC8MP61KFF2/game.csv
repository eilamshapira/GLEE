"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2000000 is well above my budget for this product. Based on my market research and valuation, I would be willing to offer $900000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while being competitive with market rates. I look forward to your response.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the time you took to research the market and provide a competitive price. However, I must say that $900000 is below my expectations. Considering the product's exceptional value, I'm willing to make a concession and offer it to you for $1800000. This price still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
