"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2000000 is well above my budget for this product. Based on my market research and valuation, I would be willing to offer $900000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while being competitive with market rates. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is below the minimum value of the product to me ($1,000,000) and also below John's offer, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the time you took to research the market and provide a competitive price. However, I must say that $900,000 is below my expectations. Considering the product's exceptional value, I'm willing to make a concession and offer it to you for $1,800,000. This price still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
