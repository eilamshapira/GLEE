"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2000000. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept this offer. While I could make a counteroffer, it's worth noting that Alice's initial offer is so high that she might not be willing to come down to a reasonable price within the limited rounds we have. However, I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a better deal before potentially buying from John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2,000,000 is well above my budget for this product. Based on my market research and valuation, I would be willing to offer $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while being competitive with market rates. I look forward to your response."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the time you took to research the market and provide a competitive price. However, I must say that $900000 is below my expectations. Considering the product's exceptional value, I'm willing to make a concession and offer it to you for $1800000. This price still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has only reduced her price by $200,000, coming down to $1,800,000, which is still significantly above both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's guaranteed price ($1,200,000). While we could continue negotiating, Alice's small reduction suggests she may not be willing to come down to a price that would be acceptable to me. Given that we have limited rounds and Alice seems to be anchored at a much higher price point, it would be prudent to exercise the option to buy from John now.
