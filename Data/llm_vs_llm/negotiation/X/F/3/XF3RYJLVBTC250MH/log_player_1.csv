Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider this strategic situation carefully. The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, but worth at least $15,000 to me. I already have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay me $15,000.

Given that Bob values the product at $10,000, he will reject any offer above that amount. And since I can get $15,000 from John, I have no incentive to sell to Bob for less than $15,000. Since Bob's maximum valuation ($10,000) is below my minimum acceptable price ($15,000), there's no zone of possible agreement.

The rational decision is to make an offer that Bob will reject, allowing me to sell to John instead.
