"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique and highly valuable product. Its unparalleled features and benefits make it a truly exceptional investment. I am confident it will exceed your expectations. I am offering it to you for:  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to consider my options carefully here. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $15,000,000, which is 15 times my maximum valuation. John is offering the same product for exactly $1,000,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

Given that Alice's price is significantly higher than my maximum valuation and John's offer, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer. I could try to negotiate with Alice, but since I have a guaranteed option to buy at my maximum valuation, the most rational decision is to buy from John.
