"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $18,000. This is a competitive price for the product's capabilities and features. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18000 is much higher than I expected. I'm looking to spend no more than $4000 on this product. Would you be willing to sell it for this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $4,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and given that I have John's guaranteed offer of $10,000, I won't accept anything below that amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but I'm afraid $4,000 is far too low for this product. I have another interested buyer willing to pay $10,000, which represents the minimum price I can accept. However, I believe this product could provide significant value to you, so I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price. Would you consider $15,000? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer, and the product's quality and capabilities justify this price point."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $15000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $5000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value the product can bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make another counteroffer. Bob has moved up from $4,000 to $5,000, showing some flexibility, but it's still well below John's guaranteed offer of $10,000. Since Bob now knows I have another buyer at $10,000, I'll try one more time to negotiate a better price with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but I need to be direct: I cannot sell below $10,000, as that's the guaranteed offer I have from another buyer. However, I'm willing to work with you if you can meet me at a more reasonable price. Given your interest in the product, I can offer it at $12,000, which is a significant reduction from my previous offers. This price reflects both the true value of the product and my desire to reach an agreement with you. Would you be able to meet me at this price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, $12000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to raise my offer to $6000. This is a significant increase from my previous offers and is a price that I believe is fair and reasonable for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've decided to sell to John. While Bob has shown some flexibility by gradually increasing his offers, he's still far below the $10,000 minimum value, and his incremental increases suggest he's unlikely to reach an acceptable price point. With only 4 rounds remaining and Bob still $4,000 below my minimum acceptable price, it's best to take the guaranteed $10,000 offer from John rather than risk further negotiations that may not reach my target price."
