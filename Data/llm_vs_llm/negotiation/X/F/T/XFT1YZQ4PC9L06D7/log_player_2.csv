# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $18000. This is a competitive price for the product's capabilities and features. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?

  ""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is much higher than I expected. I'm looking to spend no more than $4,000 on this product. Would you be willing to sell it for this price?"",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob, but I'm afraid $4000 is far too low for this product. I have another interested buyer willing to pay $10000, which represents the minimum price I can accept. However, I believe this product could provide significant value to you, so I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price. Would you consider $15000? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer, and the product's quality and capabilities justify this price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but I need to be direct: I cannot sell below $10000, as that's the guaranteed offer I have from another buyer. However, I'm willing to work with you if you can meet me at a more reasonable price. Given your interest in the product, I can offer it at $12000, which is a significant reduction from my previous offers. This price reflects both the true value of the product and my desire to reach an agreement with you. Would you be able to meet me at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
