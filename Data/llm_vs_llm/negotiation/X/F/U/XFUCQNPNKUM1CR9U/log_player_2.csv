"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

The price offered by Alice ($1,200,000) is equal to both:
1. The maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,200,000)
2. The alternative price from John ($1,200,000)

Since all prices are equal and I need the product, I might as well accept Alice's offer as it makes no difference financially."
