"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6000. I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and budget.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite able to go down to $6000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $9000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $7500. I think this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to finalize the deal if we can agree on this price.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I really can't go below a certain point. How about we settle at $8500? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $8500 is still slightly above what I'm willing to pay. Considering John is offering the same product for $8000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. If you're willing to match this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal with you.",8000.0,Bob,6,
