"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for round 1:

{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm thrilled to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Considering its value and unique features, I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6000. I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Okay, Bob's counteroffer is too low. I need to get at least $8,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob for round 3:

{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite able to go down to $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $9000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $7500. I think this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to finalize the deal if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","This is getting tricky. $7,500 is still less than what I could get from John. I need to make a decision soon. Let's see if I can push a little further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob for round 5:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I really can't go below a certain point. How about we settle at $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $8500 is still slightly above what I'm willing to pay. Considering John is offering the same product for $8000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. If you're willing to match this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","This is a tough one. Bob is now offering $8,000, the same price John is offering. I have a few options:

1.  **Accept Bob's Offer:** This secures the sale, but doesn't give me any profit.
2.  **Reject Bob's Offer & Counteroffer:** This risks losing Bob entirely and the deal could be off the table after several rejection/counteroffers, and the deal could not be closed.
3.  **Sell to John:** This is the safe play, guaranteeing $8,000.

Since I have a guaranteed $8,000 with John and the negotiations with Bob are becoming risky, I think it's best to secure the sale.
