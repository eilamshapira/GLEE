"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $950000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $950000 was a bit above your budget, but I'm not comfortable selling the product for $750000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll offer it to you for $920000, which is still a premium price, but I believe it's more reasonable. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",920000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $920000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high. I'm happy to offer $850000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and my budget constraints. I believe this is a good starting point for a final agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer of $850000. I can see that we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $890000, which is roughly halfway between your offer and my previous one. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and the progress we've made in our negotiation.",890000.0,Alice,5,
