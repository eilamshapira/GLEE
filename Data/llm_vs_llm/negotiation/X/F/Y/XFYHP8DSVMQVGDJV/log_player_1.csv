"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $950,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $950000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $750,000 is below the product's value to both of us, I'll reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to reach a better price. Selling to John for $800,000 is an option, but I'll try to negotiate a better deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $950,000 was a bit above your budget, but I'm not comfortable selling the product for $750,000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll offer it to you for $920,000, which is still a premium price, but I believe it's more reasonable. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 920000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $920000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high. I'm happy to offer $850000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and my budget constraints. I believe this is a good starting point for a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $850,000 is closer to the product's value, but still not the best possible deal for me, I'll reject it and make another counteroffer. I'll try to meet Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Selling to John for $800,000 is still not the best option, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer of $850,000. I can see that we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $890,000, which is roughly halfway between your offer and my previous one. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and the progress we've made in our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 890000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. $890000 is still a bit above my budget. To reach a mutually agreeable price, I'm offering $870000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the progress we've made.  I'm confident we can close this deal with this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Considering the progress we've made in the negotiation, Bob's offer of $870,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's close to the midpoint of our previous offers, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. Accepting this offer ensures a successful sale and a good profit, whereas continuing to negotiate may not yield a significantly better result. Additionally, selling to John for $800,000 is no longer the best option, as Bob's offer is higher."
