"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $9500 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $7000. Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering its value to you, I'm willing to go down to $8500.  Let's find a middle ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $8500. However, I still think it's a bit too high. Considering we both want to find a middle ground, I'd be willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'll offer $7750. Let me know if that works for you.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7750 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $8250. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value you place on the product.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Splitting the difference is a good idea, but I was thinking we could split the difference between your new offer and my previous one. That would put us at $8000. I think this is a fair price, considering we've both made concessions. Let me know if this works for you.",8000.0,Bob,6,
