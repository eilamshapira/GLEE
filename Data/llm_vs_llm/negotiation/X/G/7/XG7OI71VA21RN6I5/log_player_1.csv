Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll analyze this strategically:

1. The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob
2. My minimum acceptable price is $800,000
3. If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed $800,000 from John
4. Bob knows their maximum value but doesn't know my minimum

Given these factors, I should offer a price that's high but still gives Bob enough incentive to accept. If I price too close to $1,500,000, Bob might reject it. A reasonable approach would be to set the price at around $1,200,000, which:
- Gives me a significant profit above my minimum ($400,000 more)
- Leaves Bob with $300,000 in value
- Is still clearly better for Bob than walking away
