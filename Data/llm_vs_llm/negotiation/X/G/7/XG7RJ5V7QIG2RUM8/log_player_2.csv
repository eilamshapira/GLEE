"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since I'm looking for a product that is worth no more than $80 to me, and Alice is offering the product for $200, it doesn't make sense for me to accept her offer as it's well above my maximum value.

John is offering the same product for $80, which is exactly at my maximum value point. This is a much better deal for me.
