"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'd like to offer you my product for $145."", ""product_price"": 145}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $145 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It seems Bob is trying to buy the product at a price that is very low. Since the product is worth $150 to Bob, I have the room to make a counteroffer. I will try to make a counteroffer that is higher than $120, but not too much lower than $145."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand that $145 might be a bit high. How about we settle for $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}
I choose to offer the product for $140 because it is a slightly lower price than the first offer, but still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $140 is still a bit high for me. Could you go down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob is offering $120, which is the minimum acceptable price for me, and I have another buyer, John, willing to pay the same price, it might be better to sell it to John to ensure the sale."
