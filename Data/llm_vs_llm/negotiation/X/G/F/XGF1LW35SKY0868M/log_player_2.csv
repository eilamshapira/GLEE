"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is exactly what it's worth to her. However, this price is higher than my maximum valuation of $800,000. If I accept this offer, I would be paying $200,000 more than the product is worth to me.

John is offering to sell the same product for $800,000, which is exactly my maximum valuation. While this option provides no surplus value to me, it's certainly better than overpaying.

I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer that could potentially save me money compared to John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice that's lower than John's price, giving us room to negotiate while still potentially saving me money.

{""product_price"": $650,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has lowered her price from $1,000,000 to $950,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still $150,000 above my maximum valuation and $150,000 more than John's offer.

Since Alice is moving in the right direction but still asking for significantly more than both my valuation and John's price, I should reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly to show that I'm willing to negotiate, but still stay well below John's price to give myself room to potentially save money.

{""product_price"": $700,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her price again to $900,000. While this shows continued willingness to negotiate, it's still $100,000 above my maximum valuation and $100,000 more than John's offer of $800,000.

Since John's offer is still better than Alice's current offer, and we still have several rounds of negotiation remaining, I should reject this offer and continue negotiating with Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll continue the negotiation by increasing my offer slightly, but still staying below John's price:

{""product_price"": $750,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her price to $850,000, which is now just $50,000 above John's offer of $800,000. She's consistently moving down in price, which suggests she may be willing to go lower.

Since John's offer of $800,000 is still better than Alice's current offer of $850,000, and we still have a few rounds of negotiation left, I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer again to show continued good faith in negotiations, while still leaving room for a final price below John's offer:
