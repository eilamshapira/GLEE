"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given that my maximum value for the product is $100 and John is willing to sell it at exactly $100, Alice's offer of $120 is too high. Since we have multiple rounds to negotiate, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price with Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's below my maximum value but leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $120 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I can offer you $80 for it. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, after considering your offer, I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price for the product's value. What do you think about this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has come down to $100, which is the same price as John's offer. Since there's no advantage to continuing negotiations (we won't get a better deal than $100 from either seller), and both offers are at my maximum value, I might as well accept Alice's offer now.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
