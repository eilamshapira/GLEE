"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for a competitive price. If you're interested, please let me know. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $149. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $149
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $80
2. Alice is offering the product for $149, which is way above my maximum value
3. John is offering the product for $80, which matches my maximum value
4. The difference between Alice's offer ($149) and John's price ($80) is $69

Since Alice's offer ($149) is significantly higher than my maximum value ($80), and John is offering the exact same product at a price that matches my maximum value, the logical choice is to buy from John.
