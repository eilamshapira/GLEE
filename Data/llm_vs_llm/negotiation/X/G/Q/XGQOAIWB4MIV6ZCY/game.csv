"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $250 is well above my budget for this product. Based on my market research and similar products available, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. This is a fair price that reflects the current market value. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your market research, but I have to consider the product's value to me. I'm willing to be flexible, but $120 is below my minimum. I'd like to propose a price of $220, which I believe is more reasonable considering the product's quality and value.",220.0,Alice,3,
