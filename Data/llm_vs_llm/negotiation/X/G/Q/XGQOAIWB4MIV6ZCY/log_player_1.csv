"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its exceptional quality and value, I'm starting with a competitive price. I'm open to negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $250 is well above my budget for this product. Based on my market research and similar products available, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. This is a fair price that reflects the current market value. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $120 is below the minimum value of the product to me ($150), and I have the option to sell it to John for $150, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better price. 

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your market research, but I have to consider the product's value to me. I'm willing to be flexible, but $120 is below my minimum. I'd like to propose a price of $220, which I believe is more reasonable considering the product's quality and value."", ""product_price"": 220}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.
