"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $25000. This is a competitive price for what you're getting. Would you like to proceed with the purchase?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Alice. However, $25000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $5000 for the product. Could we meet at that price?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $5000 is far too low for this product's value. I can offer it to you for $22000, which is already a reduction from my initial price. This reflects the true value of the product.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. However, $22000 is still quite high for my budget. I understand the value you place on the product, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. Would you consider $7000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my budget constraints.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving up in your offer, Bob, but $7000 is still significantly below the product's value. Given the quality and market value of this product, I can offer it to you for $19000. This is a substantial reduction from my previous offers and represents excellent value.",19000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. While $19000 is a good reduction, it's still beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to increase my offer to $8500. This is the highest I can go while still respecting my budget. Can we agree on this price?",8500.0,Bob,6,
