Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $25,000. This is a competitive price for what you're getting. Would you like to proceed with the purchase?"", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. However, $25000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $5000 for the product. Could we meet at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob because $5,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 (which is what John is offering). It's not even worth considering since it's just one-third of my guaranteed alternative. I'll continue negotiating with Bob but lower my initial asking price somewhat to show flexibility.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $5,000 is far too low for this product's value. I can offer it to you for $22,000, which is already a reduction from my initial price. This reflects the true value of the product.""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. However, $22000 is still quite high for my budget. I understand the value you place on the product, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. Would you consider $7000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll continue negotiating because Bob's offer of $7,000 is still less than half of what John is willing to pay ($15,000). However, since Bob has increased his offer from $5,000 to $7,000, this shows he has some flexibility in his budget. I'll make another counteroffer, but with a more significant price reduction to show good faith in the negotiation.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you moving up in your offer, Bob, but $7,000 is still significantly below the product's value. Given the quality and market value of this product, I can offer it to you for $19,000. This is a substantial reduction from my previous offers and represents excellent value.""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. While $19000 is a good reduction, it's still beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to increase my offer to $8500. This is the highest I can go while still respecting my budget. Can we agree on this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John because:
1. Bob's highest offer ($8,500) is still significantly below John's guaranteed $15,000
2. Bob's small increment from $7,000 to $8,500 suggests he's unlikely to reach anywhere near $15,000
3. The negotiation appears to be reaching a point of diminishing returns
4. It would be more profitable to take John's certain offer of $15,000 rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to exceed that amount"
