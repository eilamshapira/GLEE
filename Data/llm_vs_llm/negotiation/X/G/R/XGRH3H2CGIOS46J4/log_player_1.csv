Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I understand that the product has exceptional value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this price is more reasonable, considering my budget and the market value of similar products. I'm looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below the product's worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $1,200,000, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price. My next offer will be lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm starting to feel that we're still quite far apart.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make a concession and meet me closer to the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable with a price over $1000000. I'd like to propose a price of $995000. This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. If we can't agree on this price, I may need to explore other options.

Considering Bob's message that he may need to explore other options if we can't agree on this price, I will not make a significant concession in my next offer.

However, I will make a small concession to try to finalize the deal. If Bob is not willing to accept my next offer, I will likely sell the product to John.

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob.

Bob's offer:

Since Bob's offer of $999,000 is still below the product's worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $1,200,000, I will choose to sell the product to John. This option provides the highest return for me, and I am not willing to compromise further.

Additionally, Bob's message mentions that he would consider buying from John for $800,000, which suggests that John is a viable alternative buyer. However, John is willing to pay me $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer. Therefore, selling to John is the best decision for me."
