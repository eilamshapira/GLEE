Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $15,000 to Bob
2. I have a guaranteed fallback of $12,000 from John
3. Bob will reject if the price is too high
4. I want to maximize my profit

I'll offer the product at $14,000, which:
- Gives Bob $1,000 in value ($15,000 - $14,000)
- Gives me $2,000 more than my fallback option
- Is likely to be accepted as Bob still benefits
- Maximizes my profit while leaving some incentive for Bob
