"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering the product for $20,000, which is $5,000 more than my maximum valuation of $15,000. Since I'm only willing to pay up to $15,000 for this product, accepting Alice's current offer would be a bad decision.

I could reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, but I already know that John is willing to sell me the exact same product for $15,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since I want to save as much money as possible while still getting the product, and there's no guarantee Alice would accept a lower counteroffer, the most rational choice is to buy from John.
