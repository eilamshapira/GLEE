"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, I believe $1200000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1000000. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than that. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer the product to you for $1100000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with at this point. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $1100000. I understand the value you place on the product, but I'm still working within a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000? I think this is a fair compromise and would allow me to proceed with the purchase.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. Your offer of $1050000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make another compromise and come down to $1075000. This is a serious concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you can work with.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
