"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $12000. This is a great opportunity to get something that's worth much more to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to carefully consider my options here:

1. Alice is offering the product for $12,000
2. The product is worth up to $15,000 to me
3. If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $15,000

Since Alice's offer ($12,000) is $3,000 less than John's price ($15,000) and still below my maximum valuation of $15,000, accepting Alice's offer would save me money.
