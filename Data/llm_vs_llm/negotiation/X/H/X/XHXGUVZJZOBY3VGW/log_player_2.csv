"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Okay, I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer of $115, reject it and negotiate, or buy from John for $120.

*   **Buying from Alice for $115:** This is a good deal, as it's below my maximum willingness to pay ($120).
*   **Rejecting and Negotiating:** This could potentially get me a better price, but it also risks ending up with a higher price or losing the product altogether.
*   **Buying from John for $120:** This is the worst option, as it's the highest price I'm willing to pay.

Since $115 is a good price, I should accept the offer.
