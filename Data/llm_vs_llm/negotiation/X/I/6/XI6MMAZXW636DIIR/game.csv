"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1800000 is significantly above my budget. I've done my market research, and similar products are available for much less.

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $1600000 is still beyond what I can justify for this product. After careful consideration of the market and my budget constraints, I can offer $1100000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in your product. What are your thoughts on this?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
