Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1800000 is significantly above my budget. I've done my market research, and similar products are available for much less. I value this product at $1000000, which I believe is a fair price considering current market conditions. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $1600000 is still beyond what I can justify for this product.
