"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to potentially sell you this incredible product. I've given it a lot of thought, and considering its value and the market, I'm prepared to offer it to you for: 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's alternative offer ($1,200,000), I should reject this offer. Even if Alice reduces the price in future negotiations, I know I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000, which is my maximum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget. I've done my market research, and similar products are available for much less. I value this product at $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair price considering current market conditions. Would you be willing to consider this offer?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

The reasoning behind my counteroffer:
1. I'm starting with a lower price ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation
2. This price is below my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000)
3. Even if Alice counters with a higher price, I still have room to negotiate up to $1,200,000
4. If negotiations fail, I can always fall back on John's offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your counteroffer, I believe the true value of this product is considerably higher. Considering the unique features and the limited availability, I'm willing to meet you somewhere in the middle. I propose: 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will reject Alice's offer of $1,600,000 because:
1. It's still significantly above my maximum value ($1,200,000)
2. It's higher than John's guaranteed offer ($1,200,000)
3. Even though Alice has moved down from $1,800,000 to $1,600,000, showing willingness to negotiate, this price is still not acceptable
4. There's still room for further negotiation, and if that fails, I can always take John's offer

I'll make another counteroffer in the next round to try to reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still beyond what I can justify for this product. After careful consideration of the market and my budget constraints, I can offer $1,100,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in your product. What are your thoughts on this?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

My reasoning:
1. I've increased my offer from $1,000,000 to $1,100,000 to show good faith and willingness to negotiate
2. This price is still below my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000), giving me room to negotiate further if needed
3. By moving up $100,000, I'm showing Alice that I'm serious about reaching a deal
4. If Alice rejects this offer, I can either make one final offer closer to $1,200,000 or take John's offer
5. The message acknowledges Alice's movement on price while firmly maintaining my position below my maximum value"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have to be realistic about the value of the product. I'm going to make a final offer. This is the lowest I can go and still feel like I'm getting a fair price, considering its potential and the other offers I'm considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I will choose to buy from John because:
1. Alice's ""final offer"" of $1,550,000 is still significantly above my maximum value ($1,200,000)
2. Alice's message indicates this is her final offer and she won't go lower
3. John's price ($1,200,000) matches my maximum value and is guaranteed
4. Further negotiation with Alice seems unlikely to reach a price below $1,200,000
5. It's time to take the sure deal rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to succeed

The rational choice is to accept John's offer at $1,200,000, as it meets my maximum value threshold and is significantly better than Alice's final offer."
