"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 25000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Start High:** I need to gauge Bob's interest and potential valuation of the product. Starting high allows me to negotiate down if necessary, without immediately undervaluing the product.
*   **Significant Margin:** $25,000 provides a significant margin above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives me room to maneuver during negotiations.
*   **No Immediate Red Flags (Hopefully):** While $25,000 is a premium price, it's not so outrageous that it will immediately scare Bob away, especially if he perceives the product to be highly valuable.
*   **Time is on my side (Initially):** With 10 rounds, I have time to probe Bob's interest and adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's initial offer of $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's also a very low opening offer, suggesting he might be trying to lowball me. I won't accept such a low price at this stage. Selling to John is a safe but less profitable move. I believe I can extract more value from Bob through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 23000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Still Above my Minimum:** $23,000 remains significantly above my $15,000 minimum.
*   **Slightly Lower, Showing Flexibility:** I'm reducing the price by $2,000 from my initial offer. This signals to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and move toward a mutually agreeable price.
*   **Anchoring Effect:** By staying relatively high, I'm hoping to keep Bob's expectations anchored higher as well. I don't want him to think he can get this product for a steal.
*   **Information Gathering:** This counteroffer will provide more information about Bob's valuation. His response will help me gauge how far apart we are and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is my absolute minimum, accepting it now would leave money on the table. Bob has moved up significantly from his initial lowball offer, indicating he *does* value the product. I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. I will make one more counter offer to see how much higher Bob is willing to go. Selling to John now guarantees my minimum, but I'm willing to take a small risk to potentially gain more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Reasonable Increment:** I've reduced the price significantly from my previous offer, hoping to entice Bob. An increase of $3,000 from his offer may seem reasonable.
*   **Profitable Outcome:** $18,000 would still be a good profit for me.
*   **Testing the Waters:** This offer serves as a test. If Bob accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll have a better understanding of his upper limit.
*   **Justifiable Price:** I can justify this price by highlighting the product's features and benefits, emphasizing its value compared to other alternatives."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has *decreased* his offer, which is a concerning sign. He's either trying to play hardball or genuinely doesn't value the product enough. I'm unwilling to go below my minimum of $15,000. There is no guarantee I can get Bob to go up to $15,000 in the remaining rounds. It's time to secure a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price, so I'll sell to John."
