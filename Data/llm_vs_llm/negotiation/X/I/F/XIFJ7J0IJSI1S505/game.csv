"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Considering its value and rarity, I'm willing to let it go for a price of $1700000. This is a fantastic opportunity!",1700000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I need to be transparent that your asking price of $1700000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1200000 to me, which is actually the price another seller (John) has already offered. I would prefer to do business with you, so I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product. This would give you a quick sale while saving me from going with the alternative option.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. While $900000 is too low, I am willing to be flexible. Considering the value of this product, my final offer is $1600000. I believe this offer provides a good balance for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1600000 is still significantly above what makes economic sense for me. I need to emphasize that I have a firm alternative option to purchase this exact product from John for $1200000, which represents the maximum value of this product to me. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer $1000000, which would save me some money while still giving you a substantial profit over your cost of $1200000. This represents a fair middle ground between us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
