"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for Round 1:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Considering its value and rarity, I'm willing to let it go for a price of $1,700,000. This is a fantastic opportunity!"", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I need to be transparent that your asking price of $1700000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1200000 to me, which is actually the price another seller (John) has already offered. I would prefer to do business with you, so I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product. This would give you a quick sale while saving me from going with the alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Okay, considering Bob's offer of $900,000 and the alternative of selling to John for $1,200,000, I will **reject Bob's offer** and make a counteroffer.
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here is my counteroffer to Bob for Round 3:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. While $900,000 is too low, I am willing to be flexible. Considering the value of this product, my final offer is $1,600,000. I believe this offer provides a good balance for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1600000 is still significantly above what makes economic sense for me. I need to emphasize that I have a firm alternative option to purchase this exact product from John for $1200000, which represents the maximum value of this product to me. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer $1000000, which would save me some money while still giving you a substantial profit over your cost of $1200000. This represents a fair middle ground between us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Okay, Bob is now offering $1,000,000, and I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, selling to John guarantees me more money.

Therefore, I'll choose to sell to John.
