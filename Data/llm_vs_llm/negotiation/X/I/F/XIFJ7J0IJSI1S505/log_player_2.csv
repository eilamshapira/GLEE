"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Considering its value and rarity, I'm willing to let it go for a price of $1700000. This is a fantastic opportunity! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer against what I know:
- The product is worth at most $1,200,000 to me
- John will sell it to me for $1,200,000
- Alice is offering $1,700,000, which is $500,000 more than my maximum value

This is clearly not a good deal for me. Since John's offer exactly matches my maximum value, and Alice's first offer is significantly higher, I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I need to be transparent that your asking price of $1,700,000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, which is actually the price another seller (John) has already offered. I would prefer to do business with you, so I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This would give you a quick sale while saving me from going with the alternative option."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. While $900000 is too low, I am willing to be flexible. Considering the value of this product, my final offer is $1600000. I believe this offer provides a good balance for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced her price by only $100,000, offering the product for $1,600,000, which is still $400,000 above my maximum value of $1,200,000. She's also calling this her ""final offer,"" though we're only in round 3 of a possible 10 rounds.

Since John's offering the product at exactly my maximum value ($1,200,000), and Alice's current offer is still substantially higher, I should reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still significantly above what makes economic sense for me. I need to emphasize that I have a firm alternative option to purchase this exact product from John for $1,200,000, which represents the maximum value of this product to me. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer $1,000,000, which would save me some money while still giving you a substantial profit over your cost of $1,200,000. This represents a fair middle ground between us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
