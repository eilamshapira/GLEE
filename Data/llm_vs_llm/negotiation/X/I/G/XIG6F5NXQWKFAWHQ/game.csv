"Hello Bob, I hope you're doing well. I have a great product that I'm looking to sell. Given the quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $25000. I believe this is a fair price considering what this product offers. Let me know if you're interested.",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $25000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $5000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand budget constraints, but $5000 is significantly below the product's value. The product has a market value of at least $15000, which is what another buyer is willing to pay right now. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $22000, which represents a good discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $22000 is still out of my budget. I can go up to $7000, which is a significant increase from my last offer but still within my financial limits. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. I appreciate that you're trying to work within your budget constraints. However, $7000 is still substantially below the product's market value. I currently have another buyer willing to pay $15000, but I'm still interested in working with you if possible. My best offer at this point is $19000, which represents a significant discount from my original price. Please let me know if this works for you.",19000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility. However, $19000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to increase my offer to $8000, which is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. I hope we can find a middle ground. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your increased offer. While I understand budget constraints, I need to be practical about the product's value. I know for certain the product is worth at least $15000, which is what my other buyer John is offering. Since we've been negotiating in good faith, I'm willing to offer you the product for $16500, which is only slightly above what I could get elsewhere. This is really the lowest I can go while still making this deal worthwhile for me. Please let me know if you can work with this price.",16500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $16500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit more and offer $9000. This is really the maximum I can go. I hope we can close the deal at this price. What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,8,
