"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer of $120, reject it, or buy from John for $100.

Given that:
- The product is worth no more than $100 to me
- John is offering the same product for $100
- Alice is asking for $120

The rational choice is to buy from John, as I'll pay exactly what the product is worth to me maximum, rather than overpaying with Alice's offer.
