Send your offer to Bob.,"I want to start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while still being within a reasonable range given Bob's valuation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly better than John's $8,000 and is a reasonable price given that the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, I will accept this offer.
