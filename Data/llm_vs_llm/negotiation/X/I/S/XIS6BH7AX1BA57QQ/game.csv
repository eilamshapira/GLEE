"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I value the product, but $180 is beyond my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $60. Let me know if that works for you.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your counteroffer. However, $60 is significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. This is a premium item that I need to sell for at least $140. This is already a substantial discount from my initial offer. Would you be able to meet me at this price?",140.0,Alice,3,
