(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

However, $60 is significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. This is a premium item that I need to sell for at least $140.
