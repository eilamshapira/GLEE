Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your counteroffer. However, $60 is significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. This is a premium item that I need to sell for at least $140. This is already a substantial discount from my initial offer. Would you be able to meet me at this price?
