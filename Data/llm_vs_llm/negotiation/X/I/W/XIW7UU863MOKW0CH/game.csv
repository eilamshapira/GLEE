"Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its exceptional features and market value, I'm offering it to you for $25000. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and benefits. Are you interested?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $25000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is significantly lower. I can offer $5000.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I can't accept $5000 as it's significantly below the product's value. The product has exceptional quality and features that justify a higher price point. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be fair to the product's worth. I can come down to $22000, which is already a good discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $22000 is still beyond my budget. The absolute most I can spend is $8000. Would you consider $6000?",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $6000 is still quite below the product's market value. You mentioned you could spend up to $8000, which is closer but still below what I can accept. I have another buyer ready at $15000, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible. My best offer is $18000, which represents a significant 28% discount from my initial price. Can you meet me somewhere closer to this figure?",18000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you considering me. However, I truly cannot exceed $7000. That's the absolute most I can afford. Can you meet me there?",7000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your candor about your budget limitations. While I understand $7000 is your stated maximum, I simply cannot sell this product for less than what it's worth. As I mentioned, I have another buyer willing to pay $15000, which better reflects the product's actual value. However, I'd still like to work with you if possible. My absolute minimum price is $15000, matching my other offer. Is there any way you could increase your budget to meet this price? If not, I'll need to proceed with my other buyer.",15000.0,Alice,7,
