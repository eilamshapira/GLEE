Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I can't accept $5,000 as it's significantly below the product's value.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $6,000 is still quite below the product's market value. You mentioned you could spend up to $8,000, which is closer but still below what I can accept. I have another buyer ready at $15,000, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible. My best offer is $18,000, which represents a significant 28% discount from my initial price.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your candor about your budget limitations. While I understand $7,000 is your stated maximum, I simply cannot sell this product for less than what it's worth. As I mentioned, I have another buyer willing to pay $15,000, which better reflects the product's actual value. However, I'd still like to work with you if possible. My absolute minimum price is $15,000, matching my other offer. Is there any way you could increase your budget to meet this price?
