"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a high initial offer to test Bob's willingness to pay and leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","I will reject Bob's offer of $400,000 as it is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and I have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a new counteroffer in the next round, lowering my initial price but still maintaining a price well above my minimum threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from the initial $2,000,000 but still keep it substantially above my minimum threshold of $1,000,000, considering Bob's low initial offer.

{""product_price"": 1600000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's new offer of $450,000 is still less than half of my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and less than half of what John is willing to pay. Given that Bob's second offer only increased marginally from $400,000 to $450,000, it seems unlikely that we'll reach an acceptable price point. Rather than continue negotiations that appear unlikely to reach my minimum threshold, I'll exercise my option to sell to John.
