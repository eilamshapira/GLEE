"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given the information:
- The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me (Bob)
- Alice is offering to sell it for $11,000
- John is willing to sell the same product for $8,000

The logical choice is to buy from John since:
1. John's price ($8,000) equals the maximum value the product has to me
2. Alice's price ($11,000) exceeds the value the product has to me
3. There's no reason to pay $3,000 more for the same product
