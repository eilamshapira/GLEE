"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly above my minimum acceptable value ($800,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
*   **Understanding Bob's Valuation:** I have no idea what the product is worth to Bob, so I'm anchoring high to try and gauge his willingness to pay.
*   **10 Rounds:** I have time to negotiate, so I don't need to rush into a lower price right away.
*   **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I can always fall back on John for $800,000 allows me to be more aggressive in the early rounds.
*   **Psychological Anchoring:** A higher initial price can influence Bob's perception of the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's opening counteroffer is exactly my minimum acceptable price. While I have John as a backup, I still have 8 rounds left. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price. There's no point in accepting the floor when I have so much time to potentially get more. I'll need to be strategic in my next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Rejecting the Anchor:** Bob tried to anchor the price at $800,000. I need to push back against that.
*   **Moving Down, but Substantially:** I'm reducing the price from my initial offer, but not by a small amount. A $50,000 reduction shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still value the product highly.
*   **Testing the Waters:** I'm still trying to gauge Bob's upper limit. This price point will give me more information about how serious he is and what he's willing to pay.
*   **Still Above the Floor:** Even if Bob completely lowballs me in the next round, I'll still have opportunities to negotiate upwards or take John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a significant jump from his initial $800,000. This indicates he sees substantial value in the product and is willing to pay more. I'm still going to reject the offer for now. I believe I can still negotiate a higher price, especially given his willingness to increase his offer so dramatically. I have 6 rounds left. Selling to John for $800,000 is the last option."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Acknowledging Bob's Move:** Bob increased his offer by $200,000, which shows he's serious. I need to acknowledge that movement.
*   **Narrowing the Gap:** I'm reducing my price by $50,000, signaling that I'm also willing to compromise. This brings us closer to a potential agreement.
*   **Testing His Limit:** $1,100,000 is still a strong price. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll get more information about his absolute maximum.
*   **Still Room to Negotiate:** I still have room to move down in future rounds if necessary, while still exceeding my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching his way up, offering $1,050,000. While this is tempting, I still have 4 rounds left. The fact that he's continuing to increase his offer suggests he *might* be willing to go higher. I will reject, but will make my next counteroffer a very reasonable one to signal I'm serious about closing a deal soon."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Signaling Seriousness:** I'm only dropping my price by $25,000 this round. This signals that I'm nearing my bottom line and expect Bob to meet me closer to my price.
*   **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** We are only $25,000 apart, suggesting we are very close to a deal.
*   **High Probability of Acceptance:** This offer is very reasonable given Bob's past offers. I anticipate a high chance of him accepting.
*   **Finalizing Strategy:** If he rejects this, my strategy will shift significantly, and I'll strongly consider accepting his next offer or sticking with John, depending on what that offer is."
