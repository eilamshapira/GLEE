"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. It's a fair price considering its potential. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, the price is beyond what I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is limited. I'd like to counter with an offer of $600000. Let me know if this works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $600000 is significantly below the product's true value. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my price to $1200000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $700000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my financial limits. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700000 is still far below the product's worth. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $900000. This is a compromise on my end, and I truly believe this price is fair for both of us. This is my final offer, I can't go any lower. Let me know if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,5,
