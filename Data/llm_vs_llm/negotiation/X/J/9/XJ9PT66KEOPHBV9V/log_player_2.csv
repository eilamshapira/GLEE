"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it can bring you significant value. How about we start the conversation at a price of $15000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully, considering that the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me.

Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which is $3,000 more than what the product is worth to me. Since I can buy the same product from John for $12,000 (which matches the maximum value of the product to me), there's no reason to accept Alice's higher offer.

Given that I can get the product at exactly my maximum valuation from John, and Alice's current offer exceeds this amount, the most logical decision is to buy from John.
