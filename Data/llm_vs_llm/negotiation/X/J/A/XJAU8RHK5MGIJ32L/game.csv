"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $60, considering my budget and the prices I've seen elsewhere. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $60 is too low considering the product's value. I can offer it to you for $150, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. This is a fair price for the quality you'll receive.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the reduction, Alice. I understand that $60 was a bit low. However, $150 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $70? It's a bit higher than my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",70.0,Bob,4,
