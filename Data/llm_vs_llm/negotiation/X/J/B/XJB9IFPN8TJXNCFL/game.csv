"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8500? I'm confident this product is worth that much to you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.",8500.0,Alice,3,

I understand that we both want to find a fair price. How about I buy the product for $7000? This seems like a balanced deal for both of us.,7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $7000 is closer, I'm still not quite there yet. Let's try $8000.  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get the product and me to earn a reasonable profit. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
