"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I need to be straightforward that your asking price of $12000 exceeds my budget. I already have an alternative offer from John for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a more favorable price. Would you consider $8500? This would provide good value for me while still giving you a reasonable profit.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I understand budget constraints, $8500 is too low for this product's value. I can reduce my initial asking price to $10500, which is a significant reduction from my original offer and represents excellent value for the product's quality and features. Would this work for you?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent that I have a firm offer from John for exactly $10000 for the same product. For me to choose to do business with you instead, I would need a better price. I'm willing to offer $9200, which saves me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both.",9200.0,Bob,4,
