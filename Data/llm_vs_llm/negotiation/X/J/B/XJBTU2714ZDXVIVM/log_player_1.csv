Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I need to be straightforward that your asking price of $12000 exceeds my budget. I already have an alternative offer from John for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a more favorable price. Would you consider $8500? This would provide good value for me while still giving you a reasonable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob. Bob's mention of having an alternative offer from John for $10,000 seems suspicious since I know John is willing to pay only $8,000. This suggests Bob might be using negotiation tactics. I'll lower my price but still aim for a better deal than $8,500.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I understand budget constraints, $8,500 is too low for this product's value.

Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent that I have a firm offer from John for exactly $10000 for the same product. For me to choose to do business with you instead, I would need a better price. I'm willing to offer $9200, which saves me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:

I'll accept Bob's offer of $9,200. While Bob is still using the claim about John's $10,000 offer (which I know isn't true), the offered price of $9,200 is significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and represents a good profit. Continuing the negotiation might risk losing this favorable offer, and Bob might become frustrated and walk away. Since $9,200 is more than what I can get from John ($8,000), it's a good deal to accept."
