"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I notice that Alice's offer is $12,000, which is actually $2,000 higher than the maximum value of $10,000 that the product is worth to me. Additionally, I know I can buy the same product from John for $10,000.

There's no reason for me to accept Alice's offer when it exceeds both my maximum valuation and John's price.

While I appreciate the product you're selling, I need to be straightforward that your asking price of $12,000 exceeds my budget. I already have an alternative offer from John for $10,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a more favorable price. Would you consider $8,500? This would provide good value for me while still giving you a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 8500}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I understand budget constraints, $8500 is too low for this product's value. I can reduce my initial asking price to $10500, which is a significant reduction from my original offer and represents excellent value for the product's quality and features. Would this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I notice that Alice has reduced her price to $10,500, which is better than her initial offer. However, this is still $500 more than John's offer of $10,000, and the product is only worth up to $10,000 to me. Since I can get the same product from John at a lower price, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer.

However, I need to be transparent that I have a firm offer from John for exactly $10,000 for the same product. For me to choose to do business with you instead, I would need a better price. I'm willing to offer $9,200, which saves me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 9200}"
