"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value your product holds. However, I have budget constraints and can offer you $1200000 for it. Let me know if we can work something out.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $1200000 is too low considering the product's value. I can reduce my initial price to $2000000. This is a substantial reduction that better reflects your budget concerns while still maintaining the product's fair market value. Would this work for you?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
