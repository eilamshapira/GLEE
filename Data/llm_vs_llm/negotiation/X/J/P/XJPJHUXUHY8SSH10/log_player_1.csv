Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique and valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value your product holds. However, I have budget constraints and can offer you $1200000 for it. Let me know if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. The price difference between Bob's offer and my initial asking price is still quite large, but since Bob showed willingness to negotiate, I'll try to find a middle ground while maintaining a strong position above my minimum acceptable price.

I'll respond with a lower price than my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's current offer, as there's still room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $1,200,000 is too low considering the product's value. I can reduce my initial price to $2,000,000.
