"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's worth to me. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $900000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1500000? This price reflects its potential and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1500000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1050000, which I believe is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I am motivated to sell, I must be realistic about the product's value. Let's settle at $1300000. This demonstrates a significant compromise from my original ask while still reflecting the true worth of what I'm offering.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
