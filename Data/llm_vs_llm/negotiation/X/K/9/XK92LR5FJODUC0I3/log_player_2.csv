"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's price ($1,500,000), and it's the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, I should reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price with Alice. There's no downside to negotiating since I can always fall back to John's offer if needed.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a significantly lower offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to be insulting. Since my maximum is $1,500,000, I'll start at around 60% of that value.
