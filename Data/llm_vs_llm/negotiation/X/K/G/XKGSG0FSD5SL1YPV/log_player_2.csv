"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm offering it to you for $19999. This product is in high demand, and I have another buyer willing to pay top dollar. Don't miss out on this opportunity! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

The reason for rejecting the offer is that Alice's price of $19,999 exceeds the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, which is $15,000. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $15,000, it makes more sense to explore that option rather than overpaying Alice."
