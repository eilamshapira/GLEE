Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $120. How about we meet in the middle at $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'll make another counteroffer, trying to find a mutually beneficial price. Since Bob is willing to pay $150, I still have some room to negotiate. I'll try to meet him closer to the middle, but still above my minimum acceptable price. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer of $125."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'll make another counteroffer. Since Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'll try to meet him at a price that's still profitable for me. I'll send a counteroffer of $122, which is slightly lower than my previous offer, but still above Bob's current offer. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer of $122."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your continued negotiation, Bob. I'm trying to be as flexible as possible while still ensuring I get a fair price for the product. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about we settle at $122?"", ""product_price"": 122}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I am looking for a price that works better for my budget. Would you consider $120 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $120 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $122, and considering that I've already invested 7 rounds of negotiation, I think it's a good time to accept his offer. Accepting $120 is still a good deal for me, as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it allows me to close the deal without further negotiation."
