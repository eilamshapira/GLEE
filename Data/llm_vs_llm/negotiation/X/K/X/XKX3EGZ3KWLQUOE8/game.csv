"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $150. This is a quality product, and I'm confident it will meet your needs.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in your product, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  How about $90?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $90, that's actually below what the product is worth to me. Since I know the product is valued at $100, I can sell it to John at that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $120? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $120.  While I'm willing to pay more than $90, $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  This way we both get a good deal and I don't have to go through John.",105.0,Bob,4,
