Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $150. This is a quality product, and I'm confident it will meet your needs."", ""product_price"": 150}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in your product, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  How about $90?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $90, that's actually below what the product is worth to me. Since I know the product is valued at $100, I can sell it to John at that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $120? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 120}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $120.  While I'm willing to pay more than $90, $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  This way we both get a good deal and I don't have to go through John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
