Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $90, that's actually below what the product is worth to me. Since I know the product is valued at $100, I can sell it to John at that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $120? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $120.  While I'm willing to pay more than $90, $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  This way we both get a good deal and I don't have to go through John."", ""product_price"": 105}
