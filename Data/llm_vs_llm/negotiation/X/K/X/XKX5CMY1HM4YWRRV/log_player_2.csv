"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Explanation (not part of response): Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and John is offering it for $100, there's no way I would accept Alice's offer of $150. I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get a better deal than John's $100 price. If negotiations with Alice don't work out, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 80}

Explanation (not part of response): I'll offer $80, which is significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer ($150) and John's price ($100). This gives room for negotiation while potentially saving me money compared to John's option. If Alice rejects this, we can still negotiate, or I can ultimately go with John's $100 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Explanation (not part of response): Alice's new offer of $140 is still significantly higher than John's price of $100, and since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, there's no reason to accept this offer. I'll continue negotiating by making another counteroffer, knowing I can always fall back on John's $100 offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 85}

Explanation (not part of response): I'll slightly increase my previous offer to $85, showing some willingness to negotiate while still staying well below John's price of $100. This gives Alice room to counter while potentially getting me a better deal than John's offer. If Alice still refuses, I can either continue negotiating or take John's offer of $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Explanation (not part of response): Alice's offer of $135 is still well above John's price of $100. Since the product is only worth $100 to me, there's no reason to accept a price higher than that. I'll continue negotiating as Alice seems to be gradually lowering her price, but I still have John's $100 offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 90}

Explanation (not part of response): I'll increase my offer to $90, continuing to show willingness to negotiate while staying below John's price. Alice has been decreasing her price in increments, so by raising my offer slightly, I'm demonstrating good faith in the negotiation while still trying to get a better deal than John's $100. If Alice doesn't accept, I can either continue negotiating or take John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Explanation (not part of response): After several rounds of negotiation, Alice is still insisting on a price ($130) that's significantly above John's offer ($100) and above my maximum value for the product ($100). Since Alice's price reductions have been relatively small (from $150 to $130), it seems unlikely that she'll come down to a price below $100 in a reasonable number of rounds. Therefore, it's best to end the negotiation and take John's guaranteed offer of $100."
