"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $10000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth about $6000 to me based on my research of similar items. I could go up to $6500, but I also have another seller (John) who's offering me the same product for $8000. I'd prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair agreement.",6500.0,Bob,2,
