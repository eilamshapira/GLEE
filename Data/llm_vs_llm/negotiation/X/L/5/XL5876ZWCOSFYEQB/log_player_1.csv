"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $10000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth about $6000 to me based on my research of similar items. I could go up to $6500, but I also have another seller (John) who's offering me the same product for $8000. I'd prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
