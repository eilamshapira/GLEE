"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's initial offer of $135 is close to my maximum budget of $150, but still higher than I'd like to pay, I'll choose to reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try and negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, to give us room for negotiation. Since I know the product is worth $100 to Alice, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than that, to show that I'm willing to make a deal.

{""product_price"": 110}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's new offer of $130 is a $5 reduction from her previous offer, which shows that she's willing to negotiate. However, I still think I can get a better deal. Since my budget is $150 and I've already offered $110, I'll try to meet Alice halfway between her new offer and my previous counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

(I'll reject the current offer and prepare to make a new counteroffer in the next round)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To meet Alice halfway between her new offer of $130 and my previous counteroffer of $110, I'll calculate the midpoint: ($130 + $110) / 2 = $120. I'll make a counteroffer of $120, which is a reasonable price considering the product's value to Alice and my own budget.
