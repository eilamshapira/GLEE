"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, I must be transparent that $2000000 is significantly above what I can justify for this purchase. I have another seller, John, who's offering the same product for $1500000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a more competitive price. Would you consider $1400000 for the product?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is below what I can accept. I understand you have other options, but this product holds significant value for me, and I believe it can be even more valuable for you. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This is a fair price that reflects the potential of this product. What are your thoughts?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
