Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, I must be transparent that $2000000 is significantly above what I can justify for this purchase. I have another seller, John, who's offering the same product for $1500000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a more competitive price. Would you consider $1400000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
