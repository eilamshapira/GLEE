"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this unique product at a price of $2000000.  I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable to you, but I'm open to negotiation.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $2,000,000, I need to evaluate whether this makes financial sense for me.

The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, so accepting Alice's offer of $2,000,000 would mean I'm paying $500,000 more than the product's value to me.

I also have the option to buy from John for $1,500,000, which matches exactly what the product is worth to me.

Since Alice's initial offer is higher than both my maximum value and John's price, the rational choice is to reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, I must be transparent that $2,000,000 is significantly above what I can justify for this purchase. I have another seller, John, who's offering the same product for $1,500,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a more competitive price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is below what I can accept. I understand you have other options, but this product holds significant value for me, and I believe it can be even more valuable for you. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This is a fair price that reflects the potential of this product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has reduced her price to $1,750,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still $250,000 more than the product's maximum value to me ($1,500,000) and also $250,000 more than John's offer.

Since John is offering the product at exactly what it's worth to me ($1,500,000), and Alice's offer remains significantly higher, it doesn't make financial sense to accept her current offer.

I could continue negotiating with Alice, but given that I have a guaranteed option at $1,500,000 that matches my valuation, and Alice is still substantially above that price point, the most rational decision is:
