"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product has potential, the price is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800000 is significantly below the product's market value. I understand budget constraints, but I need to ensure a fair price for this premium product. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1600000, which is a considerable reduction and reflects the true value of the product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1600000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the market and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
