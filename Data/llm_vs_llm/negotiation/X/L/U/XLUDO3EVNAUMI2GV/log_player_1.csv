"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,800,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential return on investment."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product has potential, the price is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's offer of $800,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and even below his own valuation of $1,000,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's market value. I understand budget constraints, but I need to ensure a fair price for this premium product. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1,600,000, which is a considerable reduction and reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1600000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the market and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $1,500,000. Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price, and even after two rounds of negotiation, his latest offer of $900,000 is still significantly below both my reservation price and the guaranteed offer from John. Given that Bob's valuation is only $1,000,000, it's unlikely he'll ever offer more than that, making it impossible to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. The sure deal with John for $1,500,000 is the best option."
