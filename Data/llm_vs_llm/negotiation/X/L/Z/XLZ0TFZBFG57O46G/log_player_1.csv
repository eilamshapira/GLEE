``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This price is still significantly lower than the value he places on the product, giving him room to potentially counteroffer. However, it also allows me to secure a substantial profit while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly,  I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob at $1,250,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than his last offer. I believe this price is fair, reflecting the product's value while still offering a good deal to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still a good deal.  Accepting it secures a profit well above my minimum requirement, and it seems like further negotiation might only delay the sale and risk losing the deal altogether."
