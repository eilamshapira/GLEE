"Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this unique and valuable product. Given its exceptional qualities and the potential benefits it offers, I'm initially pricing it at $25000. I believe this reflects its true worth. Let me know what you think.",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $25000 is far beyond my budget for this product. I'm interested, but I would be willing to offer $5000.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $25000 might seem like a significant investment upfront. However, $5000 is far too low. Given the product's unique value and the benefits it provides, I'm willing to come down to $22000. I think this is a much more reasonable price point that reflects its worth. What are your thoughts?",22000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $22000 is still beyond what I can justify. The product is interesting, but I can only offer $7000.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're still quite a ways apart, but I appreciate your continued interest. How about we meet in the middle a little more? I can offer it to you for $19000. This is a substantial reduction and really the lowest I can reasonably go at this stage. Let me know what you think.",19000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I see you're trying to compromise, $19000 is still too much for me. I'm starting to think this might not be a good fit. John is offering me a similar product for $12000. The most I can offer is $9000.",9000.0,Bob,6,
