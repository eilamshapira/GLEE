"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this unique and valuable product. Given its exceptional qualities and the potential benefits it offers, I'm initially pricing it at $25000. I believe this reflects its true worth. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","The offer is $25,000, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000. Buying from John costs $12,000. Alice's offer is way too high.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, Alice is starting high. I need to anchor the price much lower and see how she responds. I'll start with a very low offer to see how much room there is for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $25,000 is far beyond my budget for this product. I'm interested, but I would be willing to offer $5,000."", ""product_price"": 5000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $25000 might seem like a significant investment upfront. However, $5000 is far too low. Given the product's unique value and the benefits it provides, I'm willing to come down to $22000. I think this is a much more reasonable price point that reflects its worth. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice came down a bit, but $22,000 is still way too high. I am willing to pay $12,000. I will reject and offer slightly higher than my previous offer, but still way below her price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alright, Alice is still being unreasonable. I will try to nudge her down again, but stay firm about my budget limit.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $22,000 is still beyond what I can justify. The product is interesting, but I can only offer $7,000."", ""product_price"": 7000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're still quite a ways apart, but I appreciate your continued interest. How about we meet in the middle a little more? I can offer it to you for $19000. This is a substantial reduction and really the lowest I can reasonably go at this stage. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","$19,000 is still far from my maximum of $12,000. It seems like Alice is testing me. I will reject her offer and stick to my guns.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, time to see if Alice is willing to negotiate seriously. I'll increase my offer a bit but stay well below my limit and emphasize that I'm close to walking away and buying from John.

{""message"": ""Alice, while I see you're trying to compromise, $19,000 is still too much for me. I'm starting to think this might not be a good fit. John is offering me a similar product for $12,000. The most I can offer is $9,000."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
