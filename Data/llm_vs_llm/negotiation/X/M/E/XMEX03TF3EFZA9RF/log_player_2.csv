"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $25000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Based on the information provided, Alice is offering the product for $25,000, which exceeds the maximum value of $12,000 that the product is worth to you. Additionally, John is willing to sell you the same product for $12,000.

Since your goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and John's offer is significantly lower than Alice's offer (and matches the maximum value you place on the product), the rational choice would be to buy from John.
