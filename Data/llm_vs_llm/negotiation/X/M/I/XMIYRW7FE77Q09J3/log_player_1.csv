Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make a strategic offer to Bob. Since I know I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, I can be somewhat aggressive in my pricing to Bob while still ensuring I don't lose out. I'll set a significantly higher price, as Bob might value the product more than my minimum acceptable price.
