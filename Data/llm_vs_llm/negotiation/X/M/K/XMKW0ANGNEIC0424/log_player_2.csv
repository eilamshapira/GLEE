"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's alternative price ($800,000). It would not be rational to accept this offer as it would result in a loss. Since John's price is exactly at my maximum value, I'll first try negotiating with Alice to see if I can get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 750000}

I'll offer $750,000, which is below John's price of $800,000. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially allowing me to save money compared to John's offer. Since Alice's cost is $1,000,000, I expect her to reject this initial offer, but it establishes a starting point for negotiations. If Alice rejects this, I can still fall back on John's offer of $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John for $800,000 because:
1. Alice's new offer of $1,100,000 is still well above my maximum value of $800,000
2. Alice's offers ($1,200,000 â†’ $1,100,000) are dropping slowly, and since the product is worth $1,000,000 to her, she's unlikely to go below that
3. John's price of $800,000 exactly matches my maximum value
4. Continuing negotiations with Alice is unlikely to result in a better deal than John's offer
5. There's no point in further negotiation when we have a guaranteed option at my maximum acceptable price"
