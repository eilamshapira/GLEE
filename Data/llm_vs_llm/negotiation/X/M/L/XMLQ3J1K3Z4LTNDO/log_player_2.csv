"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $1,100,000
2. The product is worth $800,000 to Alice
3. John's fixed price is $1,200,000
4. My maximum value is $1,200,000

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below my maximum value, but there's room for negotiation since it's significantly above Alice's value ($800,000). I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer, as there's potential to get a better price. John's price ($1,200,000) is the highest, so that's not the best option right now.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Let me make a strategic counteroffer:

Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice and $1,200,000 to me, I'll start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation. A reasonable counteroffer would be closer to Alice's value but still profitable for her.

{""product_price"": 900000}

This offer:
1. Gives Alice a $100,000 profit (above her $800,000 value)
2. Is significantly lower than her initial offer of $1,100,000
3. Leaves room for negotiation if she counters
4. Would save me $300,000 compared to buying from John"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:

1. Alice reduced her price from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. The $50,000 reduction suggests we might be able to get a bit more reduction
3. We're still well above Alice's value ($800,000)
4. The current offer saves $150,000 compared to John's price
5. However, there's still potential room for negotiation

Since Alice showed flexibility by lowering her price, I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer. If the next round doesn't yield a better result, we might accept a similar price, but it's worth trying to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice moved down from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000, showing some flexibility, I'll increase my previous offer but still try to get a better deal than her current offer:

{""product_price"": 950000}

This counteroffer:
1. Is a $50,000 increase from my previous offer of $900,000, showing I'm also willing to be flexible
2. Gives Alice a $150,000 profit over her value ($800,000), which is reasonable
3. Is $100,000 less than her current offer of $1,050,000
4. Would save me $250,000 compared to John's price
5. Leaves some room for further negotiation if needed"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze this new situation:

1. Alice has shown consistent willingness to negotiate by reducing her price in each round:
   - First offer: $1,100,000
   - Second offer: $1,050,000
   - Current offer: $1,025,000

2. This represents significant movement from her initial position and seems to be approaching a fair middle ground.

3. The current offer:
   - Saves me $175,000 compared to John's price
   - Gives Alice a $225,000 profit over her value
   - Shows she's made meaningful concessions

Given that:
- We've had multiple rounds of negotiation
- Alice has consistently moved down in reasonable increments
- The risk of pushing too hard might lead to a breakdown in negotiations
- The current price represents a significant savings over John's price

I think it's prudent to accept this offer now.
