"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative price ($8,000), it makes sense to reject this offer. It would be unwise to accept a price that's $4,000 above my maximum value. While I could immediately go to John, it might be worth making a counteroffer to Alice first to see if we can negotiate a better price than $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 6000}

I'll offer $6,000 to Alice. Here's my reasoning:
1. I know my maximum value is $8,000
2. John is offering $8,000 as a guaranteed backup option
3. By offering $6,000, I'm:
   - Starting well below my maximum to leave room for negotiation
   - Still making a reasonable offer that might be acceptable to Alice
   - If Alice counters somewhere between $6,000 and $8,000, I could still get a better deal than John's offer
   - If Alice rejects and counters too high, I can always go to John"
