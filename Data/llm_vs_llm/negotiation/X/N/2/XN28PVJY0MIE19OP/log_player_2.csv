"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $19,000 is significantly higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($12,000), it doesn't make sense to accept this offer. Additionally, buying from John for $12,000 is an option, but I'd like to try negotiating with Alice first to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm willing to pay up to $12,000, I'll start by offering a price that is somewhat lower than that, to leave room for negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $15,000 is still higher than I'm willing to pay ($12,000), but it's a step in the right direction. Since we're only in Round 3, I'd like to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a better price. Buying from John for $12,000 is still an option, but I'll try to negotiate a bit more with Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer decreased from $19,000 to $15,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between her last offer and my previous counteroffer. My previous offer was $8,000, so I'll increase that by a significant amount to show that I'm willing to negotiate.
