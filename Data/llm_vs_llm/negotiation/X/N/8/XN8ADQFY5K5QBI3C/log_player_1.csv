Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my strategy carefully. I know the product is worth at least $100 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100. When selling to Bob, I want to maximize my profit while ensuring I don't price so high that he rejects the offer.

Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'll offer a reasonable markup that gives me a good profit but still might be attractive to Bob:

{""product_price"": 150}"
