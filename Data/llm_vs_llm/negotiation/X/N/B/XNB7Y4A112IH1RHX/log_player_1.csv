Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an initial offer that's close to Bob's maximum value but leaves some room for negotiation if needed.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,800 is above my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) but still seems too low given that the product is worth $12,000 to him, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer. We can likely find a better middle ground.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still try to capture a good portion of the value difference between my minimum ($10,000) and Bob's value ($12,000).
