"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Analyzing this situation:

1. The product is worth up to $12,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice's cost is $10,000
3. Alice is offering to sell at $11,500
4. John has a guaranteed price of $12,000

Alice's offer of $11,500 is better than John's price of $12,000, but there's still room to negotiate since Alice's cost is $10,000. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to save more money.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives me a better price while still being profitable for Alice.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Analyzing the updated situation:

1. Alice originally offered $11,500
2. I counteroffered $10,800
3. Alice has now reduced her price to $11,200, which is $300 less than her initial offer
4. John's price remains $12,000
5. Alice's cost is $10,000

Alice has moved in my direction, and $11,200 is now $800 better than John's price. While I could try another counteroffer, there's a risk Alice might get frustrated and not reduce the price further. The current offer provides me with good savings compared to the alternative.
