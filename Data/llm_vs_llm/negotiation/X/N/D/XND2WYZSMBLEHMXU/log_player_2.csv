"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since Alice's offer of $12,000 is more than the $8,000 that the product is worth to me, and is also more than John's offer of $8,000, it would not be rational for me to accept Alice's offer. I should either make a counteroffer to Alice or buy from John.

Given that John is offering exactly the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($8,000), I should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price before potentially buying from John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that gives us room to negotiate but is still lower than John's price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has lowered her price from $12,000 to $10,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this price is still higher than John's offer of $8,000, and since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, I shouldn't pay more than that.

Since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum valuation ($8,000), and Alice's current offer exceeds that, I should reject Alice's offer and try one more counteroffer before potentially buying from John.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $6,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has now lowered her price to $9,500, which shows some movement in the negotiation. However, this price is still higher than both:
1) The maximum value of $8,000 that the product is worth to me
2) John's offer of $8,000

Since I can buy the product from John for $8,000, which matches my maximum valuation, there's no reason to accept Alice's higher price of $9,500. I should either try one more counteroffer with Alice or buy from John.

Given that Alice has been gradually reducing her price but is still above my maximum value, I'll choose to buy from John rather than continuing negotiations that might not reach my target price.
