"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $180 is above my budget. The product is worth no more than $150 to me, which is what another seller is offering. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair price. Would you consider $120? This would be a good deal for me and still profitable for you.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm confident in the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $150? It's a fair price and saves you the hassle of going to another seller.",150.0,Alice,3,
