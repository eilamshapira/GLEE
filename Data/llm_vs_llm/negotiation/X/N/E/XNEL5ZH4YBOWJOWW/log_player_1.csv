"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this valuable product. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm open to offers. How about $180 to start?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $180 is above my budget. The product is worth no more than $150 to me, which is what another seller is offering. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair price. Would you consider $120? This would be a good deal for me and still profitable for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm confident in the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $150? It's a fair price and saves you the hassle of going to another seller."", ""product_price"": 150}"
