"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this valuable product. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm open to offers. How about $180 to start? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice is offering the product for $180, which is more than the $150 that the product is worth to me. Since John is willing to sell the product for $150, which is exactly my maximum valuation, there's no reason to pay more to Alice.

I could try to negotiate with Alice to get a better price than $150, but her starting price is quite high. Since I can always get the product from John for $150, I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $180 is above my budget. The product is worth no more than $150 to me, which is what another seller is offering. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair price. Would you consider $120? This would be a good deal for me and still profitable for you."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm confident in the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $150? It's a fair price and saves you the hassle of going to another seller. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has come down to $150, which is exactly what the product is worth to me and exactly what John is offering. Since both offers are now equal, I might as well accept Alice's offer rather than going through the trouble of switching to John.
