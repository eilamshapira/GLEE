"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's offer is $100, which is more than the $80 the product is worth to me and the same price as John's offer, I should not accept this offer. I can either make a counteroffer to Alice or buy from John.

Since John is willing to sell for $80, which matches my maximum valuation, I could just buy from him directly. However, I might be able to get a better deal from Alice through negotiation.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice at a price below John's price of $80, giving us room to negotiate while still potentially getting a better deal than John's offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has lowered her price to $90, which is still above both my maximum valuation of $80 and John's offer of $80. Since I can get the product from John at a better price that also matches my maximum valuation, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer.

I could make another counteroffer, but since I have a guaranteed option to buy at my maximum value point of $80, and Alice hasn't shown willingness to go below that yet, the most rational choice is to buy from John.
