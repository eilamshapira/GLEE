"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is the maximum I could pay as that's what I can get it for elsewhere. To make it worth buying from you instead, I'd need a better price. I'm willing to offer $9000 for the product. This would give me some savings while still providing you with a solid sale. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better price, and I appreciate your honesty about the market value. However, I still believe my product is worth more than $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's discuss a price of $10500, which I think is a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,
