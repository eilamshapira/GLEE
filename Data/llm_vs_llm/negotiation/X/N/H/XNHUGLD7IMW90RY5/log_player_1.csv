"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is the maximum I could pay as that's what I can get it for elsewhere. To make it worth buying from you instead, I'd need a better price. I'm willing to offer $9000 for the product. This would give me some savings while still providing you with a solid sale. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better price, and I appreciate your honesty about the market value. However, I still believe my product is worth more than $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's discuss a price of $10,500, which I think is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
