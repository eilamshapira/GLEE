"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer is $12,000, which is exactly what John is selling it for, and also equals the maximum amount the product is worth to you, there's no advantage in accepting Alice's offer over buying from John. However, by rejecting Alice's offer, I could potentially get the product for less through negotiation.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is the maximum I could pay as that's what I can get it for elsewhere. To make it worth buying from you instead, I'd need a better price. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. This would give me some savings while still providing you with a solid sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better price, and I appreciate your honesty about the market value. However, I still believe my product is worth more than $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's discuss a price of $10500, which I think is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has come down significantly from her initial price to $10,500, which is $1,500 less than what John is offering and what the product is worth to me. This is a good deal that would save me money compared to my alternative option.
