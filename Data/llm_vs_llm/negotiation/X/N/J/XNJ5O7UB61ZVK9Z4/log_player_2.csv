"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I hope you're doing well. I'm offering my product to you for $150. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's initial offer of $150 is at the upper limit of what I'm willing to pay, and I have the option to buy the product from John for the same price, I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal with Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll aim for a price that's significantly lower than $150.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $100 is too low. How about we settle at $140 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's new offer of $140 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Since I know that Alice is willing to sell the product for less than $150, and I have the option to buy it from John for $150, I'll try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to meet Alice halfway between her new offer of $140 and my previous offer of $100. A price of $120 seems reasonable, and it's still lower than Alice's current offer.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand where you’re coming from. Considering the product’s quality and value, I can adjust my price. How about we meet halfway at $125? Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's new offer of $125 is getting closer to what I'm willing to pay, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since Alice has already come down from $150 to $125, I'm hoping she'll be willing to go a bit lower.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to make a small concession to show that I'm willing to compromise, while still pushing for a lower price. Since Alice's last offer was $125, I'll offer $122, which is just a bit lower.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $122. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 122}"
