Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me analyze the situation:
1. The product is worth $150 minimum to me
2. The product is worth $100 to Bob
3. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $150
4. Bob will likely reject any offer significantly above $100

Given this, I'll start with a high offer to test Bob's willingness to negotiate.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Let me analyze Bob's offer:
1. Bob is offering $100, which is below my minimum acceptable value of $150
2. I have a guaranteed offer from John for $150
3. The negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to reach a price above $150 since the product is only worth $100 to him

Since Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value, and I have a guaranteed better offer from John, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Bob.
