Send your offer to Bob.,"Since I know the product is worth $12,000 to Bob and $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'll start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation, but not so high that it immediately ends the conversation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $15,000, it would be unwise to accept Bob's offer. While I could make another counteroffer, there's a significant gap between Bob's offer ($11,000) and my minimum ($15,000), and his low initial counteroffer suggests he might not be willing to meet my minimum price. Therefore, the most rational decision is to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John.
