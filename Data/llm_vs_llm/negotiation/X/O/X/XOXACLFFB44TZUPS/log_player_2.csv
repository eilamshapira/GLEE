Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice lowered her price to $2,000,000, which is still above my budget. I'll try to meet her halfway between her new offer and my previous counteroffer. The midpoint between $2,000,000 and $800,000 is $1,400,000. However, since I want to save as much money as possible, I'll offer a slightly lower price, $1,000,000, to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price to $2,000,000. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable offer considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has come down to $1,700,000, which is still above my budget. Since I'm getting closer to my maximum budget of $1,200,000, I'll try to make a more reasonable offer. I'll meet Alice halfway between her new offer and my previous counteroffer.

This shows that I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I won't go beyond my budget.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
