"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Looking at the options, Alice's offer is to sell the product for $1,200,000, which is exactly the same price that John is offering and exactly the maximum value the product is worth to me.

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($1,200,000), and there's no difference between the offers, I might as well accept Alice's offer since I'll end up paying the same amount either way.
