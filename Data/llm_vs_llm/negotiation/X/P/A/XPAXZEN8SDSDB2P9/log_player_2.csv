"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to make a decision that maximizes my value. Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: Pay $200 for a product worth at most $80 to me
2. Reject Alice's offer: Not explicitly stated what happens if I just reject
3. Buy from John for $80: Pay exactly what the product is worth to me

Alice's offer of $200 is well above my maximum valuation of $80, so accepting would mean losing at least $120 in value. John's offer matches my maximum valuation, so I don't lose any value.

The optimal choice is clear:
