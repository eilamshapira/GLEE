"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. Considering the product's worth to me, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you have a lower price point in mind, but I still believe the product's value is higher. I'm willing to slightly reduce my initial offer, so I'd like to propose a price of $17000. This is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me, and I hope we can meet at this point.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $17000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $7000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer and for being willing to meet me halfway. I appreciate your persistence and understand that you have a budget in mind. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to reduce my previous offer again, so I'd like to propose a price of $16000. This is a more competitive price, and I hope we can come to an agreement. If not, I do have other interested buyers, and I need to consider their offers as well.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer and for considering my previous proposals. I understand that you have other interested buyers, but I'm still interested in purchasing the product from you. However, $16000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer to meet you at a price that works for both of us. I'd like to propose a price of $7500. If this is not acceptable, I'll need to consider other options that fit within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,6,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your final offer and for being persistent in your attempts to purchase the product. I appreciate your interest and understand that you have a budget constraint. However, I must consider the product's value and the offers I have from other buyers. I'm willing to make a significant concession and propose a price of $15500. This is a very competitive price, and I'm essentially meeting you at the price point where I have another interested buyer. If you're willing to accept this offer, I'd be happy to sell the product to you. If not, I'll need to consider the other offer and sell the product to the buyer who is willing to pay a fair price.",15500.0,Alice,7,
