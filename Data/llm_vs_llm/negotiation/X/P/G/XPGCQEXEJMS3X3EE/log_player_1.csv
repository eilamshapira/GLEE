Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. Considering the product's worth to me, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6000.

I reject Bob's offer of $6,000 because it's significantly lower than the product's worth to me. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to reach a mutually beneficial price. My next offer will be $17,000, slightly lower than my initial offer, to show that I'm willing to negotiate."

Bob's offer:

I reject Bob's offer of $7,000 because it's still significantly lower than the product's worth to me. While I appreciate Bob's willingness to increase his previous offer, I'm not ready to sell the product at such a low price. I'd like to make another counteroffer to try to reach a mutually beneficial price. My next offer will be $16,000, further reducing the price to show that I'm willing to negotiate, but still ensuring I get a fair value for the product."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer and for considering my previous proposals. I understand that you have other interested buyers, but I'm still interested in purchasing the product from you. However, $16000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer to meet you at a price that works for both of us. I'd like to propose a price of $7500. If this is not acceptable, I'll need to consider other options that fit within my budget.

I reject Bob's offer of $7,500 because it's still significantly lower than the product's worth to me. Although Bob has made a good effort to increase his offer, I'm not willing to sell the product at a price that's more than 50% lower than my initial valuation. Given that I have another interested buyer, John, who is willing to pay $15,000, I'm inclined to explore that option further. However, I'd like to make one final attempt to reach an agreement with Bob. My next counteroffer will be $15,500, which is very close to the price John is offering, to see if Bob is willing to meet me at that point."
