"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I should consider my options:

*   **Accept Alice's offer:** This costs me $150, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay.
*   **Reject Alice's offer:** This might lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice not agreeing and me having to buy from John later.
*   **Buy from John:** This costs me $150, which is the same as accepting Alice's offer.

Since the price is the same in the first two options, I can try my luck.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I need to offer a price lower than $150 to save some money. I know the product is worth $120 to Alice, so I'll try to get it for as low as possible while still giving Alice some profit. Let's start with a price that's a little higher than Alice's cost but still beneficial to me.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Okay, Alice is offering $140 now.

*   **Accept Alice's offer:** This costs me $140.
*   **Reject Alice's offer:** I can counteroffer again, but risk the negotiation failing and ending up with a worse deal.
*   **Buy from John:** This costs me $150.

$140 is better than $150, and it is possible that if I make a new counteroffer, I will get a higher price. So I can accept the current offer.
