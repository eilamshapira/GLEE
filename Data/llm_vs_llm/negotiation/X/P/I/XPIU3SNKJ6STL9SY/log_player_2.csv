"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic offer for you! I'm selling a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm offering it to you for $14000. This is a great opportunity that you won't want to miss! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still quite high considering the product's value to Alice. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm looking for a better deal."
