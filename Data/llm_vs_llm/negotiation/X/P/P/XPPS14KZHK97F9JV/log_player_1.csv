Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my options carefully here. I can offer any price to Bob, but I need to keep in mind:

1. The product is worth $12,000 to Bob
2. If Bob rejects, I can sell to John for $15,000
3. The product is worth at least $15,000 to me

Given these constraints, it doesn't make sense for me to sell to Bob at all. Since the product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and Bob values it at only $12,000, there's no price that would be acceptable to both of us. Even if I offered it at $12,000 (Bob's maximum value), I would be losing $3,000 compared to my minimum acceptable value.

The rational choice is to skip negotiating with Bob and sell directly to John for $15,000. However, if I need to make an offer to Bob as instructed:

{""product_price"": 15000}

This offer preserves my minimum acceptable value, though Bob will likely reject it since it exceeds his valuation."
