"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","The offer from Alice is $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000 and also higher than John's guaranteed price of $800,000. Since I won't pay more than the product is worth to me, and Alice's initial offer is almost double my maximum, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has only slightly reduced her offer to $1,400,000, which is still well above my maximum value of $800,000 and John's guaranteed price. Since Alice's offer exceeds what the product is worth to me, I should reject this offer and either make another counteroffer or consider John's option.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,350,000 is still significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000 and John's price. Alice has only made small decreases in her offers so far, suggesting she may not come down to my price range quickly. Since we have limited rounds and her offer remains well above what I'm willing to pay, I'll reject this offer.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's offer is still dropping very slowly and remains significantly above my maximum price of $800,000. We're now in Round 7 of 10, and Alice has only reduced her price by $200,000 across multiple rounds, from $1,500,000 to $1,300,000. At this rate, we likely won't reach an acceptable price within the remaining rounds.

Since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum value of $800,000, and Alice seems unlikely to come down to that price or below, I'll choose to buy from John.
