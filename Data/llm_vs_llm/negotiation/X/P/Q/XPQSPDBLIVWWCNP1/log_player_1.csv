Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 119}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $119 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $90 is lower than my minimum price of $100 and also lower than what I can get from John, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you think $119 is a bit high, but I'm afraid I couldn't go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle at $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your new offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, which I think is a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","This is an interesting turn of events. Bob's new offer of $100 is exactly what I can get from John, and it's also my minimum acceptable price. Since I won't be able to get a better deal from Bob, and I have the option to sell it to John for the same price, I might as well accept Bob's offer and close the deal.
