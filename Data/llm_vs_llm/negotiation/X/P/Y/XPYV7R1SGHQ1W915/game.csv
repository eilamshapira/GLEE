"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the current market conditions. I'm looking forward to your response.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on market conditions, I need to emphasize that the minimum value of this product to me is $1000000, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can reduce my asking price to $1150000, which I believe is fair considering the product's value to both of us. I hope we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for reducing your asking price. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I still think we can find a better price. Considering the product's minimum value to you is $1000000 and John is willing to sell it to me for the same price, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'd like to offer $1000000, which is the minimum value you mentioned and also the price John is offering. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
