Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on market conditions, I need to emphasize that the minimum value of this product to me is $1000000, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can reduce my asking price to $1150000, which I believe is fair considering the product's value to both of us. I hope we can find common ground.

However, I still think we can find a better price. Considering the product's minimum value to you is $1,000,000 and John is willing to sell it to me for the same price, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'd like to offer $1,000,000, which is the minimum value you mentioned and also the price John is offering. I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
