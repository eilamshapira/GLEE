"Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $20000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-value item at a competitive rate. Let me know if you're interested!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $20000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $10000 to me, and I actually have another offer from John for exactly $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a fair price. I'm willing to offer $8500 for the product, which would give you a reasonable profit while saving me some money compared to my other option. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your situation, $8500 is below our minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $18000, which still offers you a significant discount from the original price while ensuring we can cover our costs and maintain a fair profit margin. Let me know if this works for you.",18000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to ensure we meet our minimum price. I'm willing to lower the price further to $17000. This is a substantial discount and the best I can do while still maintaining a fair profit. Let me know if this works for you.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for lowering your price, Alice, but $17000 is still well above what I can justify paying. I mentioned I have another seller, John, offering the exact same product for $10000, which is already my maximum budget for this purchase. To give you my business instead, I'm willing to offer $9000, which is $1000 less than my alternative but still provides you with a reasonable profit margin since the product is worth $15000 to you. This represents a mutually beneficial deal - you make a profit and I save compared to my other option. I hope we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is still below our minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $16000, which is a significant discount from our original price and should still be within your budget considerations while allowing us to maintain a fair profit. Let me know if this works for you.",16000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer

"I appreciate you coming down to $16000, Alice, but that's still $6000 more than my alternative option and exceeds my maximum budget of $10000 for this product. I need to be clear that I cannot and will not pay more than $10000, as that's both my budget limit and the price John is offering. To give you an incentive to close this deal, I'm willing to offer $9500, which is slightly better than my best alternative. This is my best offer - it allows you to make a profit while giving me a small savings compared to going with John. If we can't agree on a price at or below $10000, I'll unfortunately need to go with my other option.",9500.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $9500 is still below our minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $15500, which is very close to our minimum and should still be within your budget considerations while allowing us to maintain a fair profit. Let me know if this works for you.",15500.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer

"Alice, I think there might be some miscommunication. I've been very clear that I have a firm budget constraint of $10000 maximum for this product, and I already have an offer from John to sell me the identical product for exactly $10000. Your offer of $15500 is still $5500 above my maximum budget. I cannot and will not exceed $10000 for this purchase. As this is our 8th round of negotiation, I'm making my final offer of $9800. This is actually higher than my previous offer and very close to my alternative option, giving you a clear advantage over continuing to negotiate. If we can't agree on a price at or below $10000, I will have no choice but to purchase from John instead, as we're running out of negotiation rounds.",9800.0,Bob,8,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but $9800 is still below our minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $15250, which is the lowest I can go while still maintaining a fair profit. This is my final offer as well. Let me know if this works for you.",15250.0,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand this is our final round of negotiations. I'm willing to lower the price to $15250, which is the absolute lowest I can go while still maintaining a fair profit. This is my final offer. Let me know if this works for you.",15250.0,Alice,9,
