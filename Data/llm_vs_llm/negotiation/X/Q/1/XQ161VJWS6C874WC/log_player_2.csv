"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $20000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-value item at a competitive rate. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","The price Alice is offering ($20,000) is significantly higher than the product's worth to me ($10,000) and even higher than what John is offering ($10,000). There's no reason to accept this offer.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $20,000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and I actually have another offer from John for exactly $10,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a fair price. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product, which would give you a reasonable profit while saving me some money compared to my other option. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to ensure we meet our minimum price. I'm willing to lower the price further to $17000. This is a substantial discount and the best I can do while still maintaining a fair profit. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for lowering your price, Alice, but $17,000 is still well above what I can justify paying. I mentioned I have another seller, John, offering the exact same product for $10,000, which is already my maximum budget for this purchase. To give you my business instead, I'm willing to offer $9,000, which is $1,000 less than my alternative but still provides you with a reasonable profit margin since the product is worth $15,000 to you. This represents a mutually beneficial deal - you make a profit and I save compared to my other option. I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to ensure we meet our minimum price. I'm willing to lower the price further to $16000. This is a substantial discount and the best I can do while still maintaining a fair profit. Let me know if this works for you.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down to $16,000, Alice, but that's still $6,000 more than my alternative option and exceeds my maximum budget of $10,000 for this product. I need to be clear that I cannot and will not pay more than $10,000, as that's both my budget limit and the price John is offering. To give you an incentive to close this deal, I'm willing to offer $9,500, which is slightly better than my best alternative. This is my best offer - it allows you to make a profit while giving me a small savings compared to going with John. If we can't agree on a price at or below $10,000, I'll unfortunately need to go with my other option."", ""product_price"": 9500}"

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I think there might be some miscommunication. I've been very clear that I have a firm budget constraint of $10,000 maximum for this product, and I already have an offer from John to sell me the identical product for exactly $10,000. Your offer of $15,500 is still $5,500 above my maximum budget. I cannot and will not exceed $10,000 for this purchase. As this is our 8th round of negotiation, I'm making my final offer of $9,800. This is actually higher than my previous offer and very close to my alternative option, giving you a clear advantage over continuing to negotiate. If we can't agree on a price at or below $10,000, I will have no choice but to purchase from John instead, as we're running out of negotiation rounds."", ""product_price"": 9800}"
