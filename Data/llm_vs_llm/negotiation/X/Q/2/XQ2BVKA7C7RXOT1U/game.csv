"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I find $1200000 to be quite high. I have other options available at this price point, so I would need a better deal to consider purchasing from you. I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product. This is a substantial amount that reflects my genuine interest while giving you a good return. Would you consider this offer?",800000.0,Bob,2,
