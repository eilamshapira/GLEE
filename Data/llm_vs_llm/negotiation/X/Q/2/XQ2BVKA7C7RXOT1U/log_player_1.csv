Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I find $1200000 to be quite high. I have other options available at this price point, so I would need a better deal to consider purchasing from you. I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product. This is a substantial amount that reflects my genuine interest while giving you a good return. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me with your offer. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but $800,000 is below the minimum I can accept.

This way, we can both walk away from the deal happy. What do you think?"",
