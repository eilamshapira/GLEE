"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I have a premium product that I believe you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. This product is highly valuable, and I'm sure it would be a great asset to you. If you're interested, please let me know. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given that both Alice's offer and John's price are exactly $1,200,000, and this is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, I should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price. There's no downside to negotiating since I can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations with Alice don't work out.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a significantly lower counteroffer to leave room for negotiation while explaining my position.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I find $1,200,000 to be quite high. I have other options available at this price point, so I would need a better deal to consider purchasing from you. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. This is a substantial amount that reflects my genuine interest while giving you a good return. Would you consider this offer?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I considered your offer and I'm willing to lower my price to $1000000. This price recognizes your interests and ensures that I'm getting a good return for my valuable product. It's a win-win for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept this new offer.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced the price by $200,000 from her initial offer, which is a significant reduction. Since this price is $200,000 less than what John is offering, and I know my maximum value for the product is $1,200,000, this is a good deal that will save me money. I should accept this offer rather than risk losing it by continuing to negotiate.
