Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to think about this strategically. I know the product is worth $12,000 to Bob and no less than $12,000 to me. If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell to John for $12,000.

Since Bob and I value the product equally at $12,000, and I have the guaranteed backup option of selling to John for $12,000, I should offer the product to Bob at exactly $12,000. This is the highest price Bob might accept given his valuation, and if he rejects it, I still get the same amount from John.
