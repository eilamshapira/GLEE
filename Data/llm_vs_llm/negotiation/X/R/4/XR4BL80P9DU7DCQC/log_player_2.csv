"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that has significant value, potentially much more than $1200000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000, but I understand it may be a significant investment. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I believe this product could be truly valuable to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to evaluate this offer based on my constraints. 

The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me. Alice is offering to sell it for $1,500,000, which exceeds my valuation.

John is willing to sell the same product for $1,000,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since I can get the product from John at a price that doesn't exceed my valuation, and Alice's offer is $500,000 higher than both my valuation and John's price, the rational choice is to buy from John.
