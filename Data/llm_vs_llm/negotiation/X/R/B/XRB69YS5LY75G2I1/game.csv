"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is way above my budget. I can find similar products in the market for much less. I would be willing to pay $8000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest! While I understand your budget constraints, I cannot sell the product for $8000. However, I can offer it to you for $18000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested!",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you reducing the price, but $18000 is still much higher than what I can afford. I've researched the market, and I can actually get this product elsewhere for $12000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer $10000, which I believe is a reasonable price.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I canâ€™t go as low as $10000. How about meeting me in the middle? I can offer you the product for $15000. This is the minimum I can accept, and it's still a great deal for you. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,5,
