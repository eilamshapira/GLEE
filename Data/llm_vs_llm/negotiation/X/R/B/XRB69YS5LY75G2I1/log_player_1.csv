Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is way above my budget. I can find similar products in the market for much less. I would be willing to pay $8000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you reducing the price, but $18000 is still much higher than what I can afford.

I can offer $10000, which I believe is a reasonable price.
