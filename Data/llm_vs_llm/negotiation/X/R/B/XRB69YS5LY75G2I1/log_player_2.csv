"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have an incredible product that I believe will be valuable to you. I would like to offer it to you for $20000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $12,000 and also higher than John's guaranteed price. It would be wise to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, as there might be room for negotiation with Alice to get a better price than John's $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20,000 is way above my budget. I can find similar products in the market for much less. I would be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 8000}

I'm starting with a lower offer of $8,000 to leave room for negotiation. This price is significantly below John's price of $12,000, which gives us space to negotiate upward if needed while still potentially getting a better deal than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest! While I understand your budget constraints, I cannot sell the product for $8000. However, I can offer it to you for $18000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice only reduced her price by $2,000 from $20,000 to $18,000, which is still significantly above both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000). The large gap between our positions suggests Alice might have more room to negotiate. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, though if Alice doesn't make more significant movement in price, I may need to consider John's option soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you reducing the price, but $18,000 is still much higher than what I can afford. I've researched the market, and I can actually get this product elsewhere for $12,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer $10,000, which I believe is a reasonable price."", ""product_price"": 10000}

I'm strategically mentioning the market alternative (John's price) to let Alice know I have other options, while increasing my offer to $10,000 to show I'm willing to negotiate. This price still gives us room to negotiate upward if needed, while potentially getting a better deal than John's $12,000 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I canâ€™t go as low as $10000. How about meeting me in the middle? I can offer you the product for $15000. This is the minimum I can accept, and it's still a great deal for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, it's best to buy from John for $12,000. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer of $15,000 is still well above John's price of $12,000
2. Alice stated this is her ""minimum"" price, suggesting she's unlikely to go much lower
3. We've already gone through 5 rounds, and the gap between our positions ($10,000 vs $15,000) is still quite large
4. Even if Alice were to reduce her price further, it's unlikely she would go below John's $12,000 given her negotiation pattern
5. Since my maximum value for the product is $12,000, John's price is already at my upper limit

Therefore, it makes more sense to take John's guaranteed offer rather than continue negotiating with Alice."
