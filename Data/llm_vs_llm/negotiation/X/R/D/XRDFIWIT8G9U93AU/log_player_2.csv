"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $3,000,000 is way too high, considering the product is only worth $1,500,000 to me and I can buy it from John for that price. It would make no sense to accept this offer. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a low but reasonable offer, considering the product's value and the fact that I have John's offer as a backup.

{""product_price"": 1000000}

This offer is strategically set at $1,000,000, which:
1. Gives room for negotiation
2. Is below John's price of $1,500,000
3. Could potentially save me significant money if accepted
4. Shows I'm serious about negotiating but also aware of market value"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $2,500,000 is still significantly higher than both:
1. John's guaranteed price of $1,500,000
2. The actual value of the product to me ($1,500,000)

While Alice has reduced her price from $3,000,000 to $2,500,000, showing some willingness to negotiate, this price is still not competitive. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round, but if Alice doesn't come down significantly, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'll increase my offer slightly to $1,200,000, which:
1. Shows I'm willing to move up from my initial offer
2. Is still well below John's price of $1,500,000, giving me potential savings
3. Might be more appealing to Alice since we know the product is worth $1,500,000 to her
4. Leaves room for further negotiation while still being reasonable
5. Demonstrates I'm negotiating in good faith by making meaningful movements in price"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice continues to lower her price (from $3M → $2.5M → $2M), showing she's willing to negotiate, $2,000,000 is still significantly above:
1. John's guaranteed price of $1,500,000
2. The maximum value of the product to me ($1,500,000)

There's no reason to accept a price that's $500,000 more than what I can get from John. I'll reject and make another counteroffer. If Alice doesn't come close to John's price soon, it would be rational to switch to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1300000}

I'll increase my offer to $1,300,000, which:
1. Shows continued willingness to negotiate by making another meaningful step up
2. Is still $200,000 below John's price, maintaining potential savings
3. Gets closer to Alice's cost basis of $1,500,000, potentially making it more appealing to her
4. Signals that my offers are gradually approaching a middle ground
5. Maintains my position while demonstrating good faith in the negotiation

If Alice doesn't respond with a price close to John's $1,500,000, I may need to seriously consider taking John's offer in the next rounds to ensure I secure the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John for $1,500,000 because:
1. Alice's latest offer ($1,750,000) is still $250,000 above John's price
2. Given that Alice's starting point was $3M and she's only come down to $1.75M after several rounds, it seems unlikely she'll match or beat John's price
3. The product is only worth $1,500,000 to me anyway, so there's no reason to pay more
4. We've already spent 7 rounds negotiating, and time has value
5. John's offer provides a guaranteed price at the maximum value I'm willing to pay

It's time to end the negotiation and take the sure deal with John rather than continue negotiating with Alice, who seems unlikely to match John's price."
