"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I believe the product has potential, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to ensure it fits within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $1200000 is a significant amount, it's still below the value I've placed on this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This reflects a fair compromise that acknowledges your needs and my investment in this opportunity.  Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I see your point about the product's value, and I appreciate the reduction to $1350000. However, I was thinking we could meet in the middle. Would you be open to selling the product for $1275000? This price reflects a compromise between our last two offers and would be more in line with my budget.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
