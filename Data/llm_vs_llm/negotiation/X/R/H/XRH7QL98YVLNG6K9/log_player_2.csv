"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is incredibly valuable, and I believe it could be a game-changer for your business. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. I'm confident this price reflects the significant potential it holds. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's initial offer is exactly at the maximum value I'm willing to pay ($1,500,000), and I have the option to buy the same product from John for the same price, I see no benefit in accepting Alice's offer without trying to negotiate a better price. However, given that the price Alice is offering is already at my maximum budget, the potential for saving money through negotiation seems limited. Nonetheless, I'll start by rejecting the offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate, hoping she might be flexible on the price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice's initial offer is at the top of my budget, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly lower to test the waters and see if there's any room for negotiation. Since I don't know the minimum price Alice is willing to accept, starting with a modest reduction seems prudent.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I believe the product has potential, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to ensure it fits within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $1200000 is a significant amount, it's still below the value I've placed on this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This reflects a fair compromise that acknowledges your needs and my investment in this opportunity.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has made a counteroffer of $1,350,000, which is a $150,000 reduction from her initial offer. This indicates she is willing to negotiate, but the product's value to her is still quite high. My goal is to save as much money as possible, and since Alice has already come down by $150,000, it suggests there might be some flexibility, but we're still $150,000 apart from my counteroffer of $1,200,000.

Given that Alice's new offer is $1,350,000 and my maximum budget is $1,500,000, I have room to negotiate further. Buying from John for $1,500,000 is still an option, but I'd like to explore if I can get a better deal from Alice.

I'll make another counteroffer, trying to meet somewhere in the middle between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. A midpoint between $1,200,000 and $1,350,000 would be $1,275,000. This offer shows I'm willing to compromise while also trying to save as much money as possible.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my counteroffer would be: 
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I see your point about the product's value, and I appreciate the reduction to $1,350,000. However, I was thinking we could meet in the middle. Would you be open to selling the product for $1,275,000? This price reflects a compromise between our last two offers and would be more in line with my budget."", ""product_price"": 1275000}"
