"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $600000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",600000.0,Bob,2,
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your perspective, the price of $600000 is significantly below our minimum acceptable value.

I'm hoping we can find a compromise soon.",750000.0,Bob,6,
