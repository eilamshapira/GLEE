"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $1200000. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm open to negotiations.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to make an offer. While $900000 is a serious offer, I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000, considering the product's exceptional value and my initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still believe it's worth more than your initial offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1050000 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we settle at $975000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $975000 is a better offer, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you closer to the middle. How about we discuss a price of $1020000? I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for understanding.  I'm willing to move a little bit, how about $990000?",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I think we're getting close to a mutually agreeable price. I appreciate your willingness to move up to $990000. I'm willing to make a small concession to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss a price of $1005000? I believe this is a fair compromise, considering our previous discussions.",1005000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, you're right, we are getting close!  To make this happen, I can go up to $997500.  What do you think?",997500.0,Bob,8,
