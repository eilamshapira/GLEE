"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that I know the product is worth $120 to Bob and $150 to me, I'll start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I don't go below my minimum value.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $100 is well below my minimum acceptable value of $150, and I know I can sell to John for $150, there's no reason to accept this low offer. However, I'll try one more negotiation round with Bob before going to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob countered with $100, which is far below my minimum of $150, I'll lower my price somewhat but still keep it high enough to protect my interests.

{""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's offer of $110 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150, and his incremental increase from $100 to $110 suggests he's not likely to reach my minimum price. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, which meets my minimum value, it's best to end the negotiation with Bob and take the sure deal with John.
