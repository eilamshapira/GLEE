"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $80 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering the product for $150
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $80
4. If I accept Alice's offer, I'll be paying $70 more than my maximum valuation
5. If I buy from John, I'll be paying exactly what the product is worth to me

Since Alice's price ($150) is significantly higher than both:
- My maximum valuation ($80)
- John's alternative offer ($80)

The rational decision would be to buy from John.
