"Hello Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $1200000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1200000 is significantly above market value for this product. I have another seller, John, willing to sell me the same product for $800000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm prepared to offer you $750000 for the product, which allows you to make a quick sale while giving me a slight advantage over my alternative option.",750000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest in doing business with me, $750000 is below my minimum threshold for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which still offers you significant value while respecting the worth of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",1100000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to maintain the value of the product. I'm willing to lower the price to $1050000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer and still provides you with a competitive edge. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. However, $1050000 is still substantially above my budget and the market value. I need to be clear that I have a firm alternative offer from John at $800000, which means any deal we make needs to be at or below that price point for me to consider it. I'm willing to offer you $780000, which is very close to my alternative option but would save me the trouble of switching sellers. This represents my best offer based on the product's value to my business.",780000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I appreciate your transparency about your budget constraints. However, $780000 is still below what I can accept for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product at $1000000, which is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business and is still within the range of your alternative offer. Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand the pressure you're under with your alternative offer. To facilitate a deal, I'm willing to lower the price further to $950000. This is a significant concession on my part, and it should provide you with a compelling reason to choose our product over John's offer. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but I need to be straightforward here. The product is worth $800000 to me - that's my maximum value point. That's why John's offer at $800000 makes financial sense for me. For me to choose you as my supplier, you'd need to match or beat that price. Given our ongoing negotiation and relationship, I'm willing to offer $790000 as my final counteroffer. This is actually above what I'd pay John, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible. If we can't reach an agreement at this price point, I'll need to move forward with John's offer.",790000.0,Bob,6,
"Bob, I understand your position and the value you place on the product. However, $790000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $900000, which is a significant reduction from my previous offer and still provides you with a competitive edge over John's offer. This is my final counteroffer, and if we can't agree on this, I'll need to consider other options. Let me know if this works for you.",900000.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand the urgency and your constraints. I'm willing to lower the price to $850000, which is a substantial reduction and very close to your maximum value point. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise. Let me know if you can accept this price.",850000.0,Alice,7,
