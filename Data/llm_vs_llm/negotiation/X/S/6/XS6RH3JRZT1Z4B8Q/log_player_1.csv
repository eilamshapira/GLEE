Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1200000 is significantly above market value for this product. I have another seller, John, willing to sell me the same product for $800000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm prepared to offer you $750000 for the product, which allows you to make a quick sale while giving me a slight advantage over my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. However, $1050000 is still substantially above my budget and the market value. I need to be clear that I have a firm alternative offer from John at $800000, which means any deal we make needs to be at or below that price point for me to consider it. I'm willing to offer you $780000, which is very close to my alternative option but would save me the trouble of switching sellers. This represents my best offer based on the product's value to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000

However, $780,000 is still below what I can accept for this product.

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but I need to be straightforward here. The product is worth $800000 to me - that's my maximum value point. That's why John's offer at $800000 makes financial sense for me. For me to choose you as my supplier, you'd need to match or beat that price. Given our ongoing negotiation and relationship, I'm willing to offer $790000 as my final counteroffer. This is actually above what I'd pay John, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible. If we can't reach an agreement at this price point, I'll need to move forward with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000.

Round 7
