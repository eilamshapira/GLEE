"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 300}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","$80 is way below my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's not even close to being reasonable given that I can sell to John for $150. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite low at $80, I'll lower my initial price but still maintain a strong position well above my minimum of $150.

{""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob has only increased his offer by $10 (from $80 to $90), which is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Since Bob's offers have shown very small increments and remain well below my minimum, and we've already gone through 4 rounds, it might be best to take the guaranteed $150 from John rather than continue this unproductive negotiation.
