Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","I'll analyze this situation:

1. My product is worth at least $80 to me
2. I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80
3. Bob's offer is $110, which is significantly better than John's $80

Since Bob's offer of $110 exceeds my minimum value and the alternative buyer's price by $30, I'll accept his offer.
