Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high offer, considering the product is worth $100 to Bob and I can always fall back to selling it to John for $80.

{""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","I'll reject Bob's offer of $70 since it's below my minimum value of $80, and I have John's guaranteed offer of $80. I'll continue negotiating with Bob since there's potential to get a better price than $80.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price a bit from my initial offer but still keep it well above my minimum value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $75 is still below John's guaranteed offer of $80, and Bob seems to be making only small increases in his offers, I'll take the sure deal with John.
