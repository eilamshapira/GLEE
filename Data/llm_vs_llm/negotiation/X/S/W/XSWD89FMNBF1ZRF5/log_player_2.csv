"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think about this strategically:
1. The product is worth no more than $150 to me
2. John's price ($150) is my fallback option
3. Alice's cost is $100, so there's room for negotiation
4. $140 is better than John's price, but still seems high given Alice's cost

Since I have 10 rounds of negotiation available and Alice's cost ($100) is significantly lower than her offer ($140), I should try to negotiate for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but gives room for negotiation:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I think $140 is a bit high. Given the market value of similar products, I would be willing to pay $115. This would still give you a good profit margin while being a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let's analyze this:
1. Alice has dropped her price from $140 to $130, showing willingness to negotiate
2. $130 is better than John's price ($150)
3. We still have 7 more rounds available
4. The gap between Alice's cost ($100) and current offer ($130) suggests there might still be room for negotiation

Since we've made good progress and still have several rounds left, I'll try one more round of negotiation to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that moves closer to Alice's position while still trying to get a good deal:

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet at $120? That's a fair increase from my previous offer and would still give you a good profit margin."", ""product_price"": 120}"
