"Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2500000. This price reflects the product's true worth and potential value. Would you be interested in making this investment?",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $2500000 is significantly above my budget and valuation. The product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I have an alternative option to purchase it at that price from another seller. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to offer $700000 for the product, which I believe is fair considering market conditions.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700000 is significantly below the product's value. While I understand you're working within a budget, I need to be transparent that my absolute minimum is $1500000, as I have other interested parties at this price point. However, I'd like to continue our negotiation. Given that you mentioned the product is worth up to $1000000 to you, I'm willing to offer it at $1800000, which is a substantial reduction from my initial price. This represents a fair middle ground considering the product's quality and market value.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for lowering your price, Alice. I understand you believe $1500000 is your minimum, but I need to be straightforward that I cannot exceed $1000000 for this product - that's its maximum value to me, and I have a confirmed option to purchase it at exactly that price from another seller. However, I would prefer to work with you if possible. My best offer is $850000, which would save me from going with the alternative option while giving you a sale above what I initially offered. This is a genuine offer based on my actual budget constraints.",850000.0,Bob,4,
