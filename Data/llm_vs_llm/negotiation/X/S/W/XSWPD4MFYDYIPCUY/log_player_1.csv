Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,500,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $2500000 is significantly above my budget and valuation. The product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I have an alternative option to purchase it at that price from another seller. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to offer $700000 for the product, which I believe is fair considering market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I reject Bob's offer of $700,000 as it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Bob's mention of having an alternative at $1,000,000 seems questionable since he's offering below that amount. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but if we can't reach a reasonable agreement, I always have John's offer as a reliable backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is significantly below the product's value. While I understand you're working within a budget, I need to be transparent that my absolute minimum is $1,500,000, as I have other interested parties at this price point. However, I'd like to continue our negotiation. Given that you mentioned the product is worth up to $1,000,000 to you, I'm willing to offer it at $1,800,000, which is a substantial reduction from my initial price. This represents a fair middle ground considering the product's quality and market value."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for lowering your price, Alice. I understand you believe $1500000 is your minimum, but I need to be straightforward that I cannot exceed $1000000 for this product - that's its maximum value to me, and I have a confirmed option to purchase it at exactly that price from another seller. However, I would prefer to work with you if possible. My best offer is $850000, which would save me from going with the alternative option while giving you a sale above what I initially offered. This is a genuine offer based on my actual budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've decided to sell to John for $1,500,000. Bob has consistently maintained that he won't exceed $1,000,000, which is well below my minimum acceptable price. His latest offer of $850,000 is still significantly below my minimum, and given that we've had multiple rounds of negotiation with little progress toward my target price, it's best to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to reach my minimum threshold."
