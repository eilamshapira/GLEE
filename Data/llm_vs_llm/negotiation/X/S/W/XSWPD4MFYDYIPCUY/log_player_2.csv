"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2500000. This price reflects the product's true worth and potential value. Would you be interested in making this investment? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's offer of $2,500,000 is significantly higher than the product's worth to me (which is at most $1,000,000) and also higher than John's price of $1,000,000. Since I want to save as much money as possible while acquiring the product, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $2,500,000 is significantly above my budget and valuation. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and I have an alternative option to purchase it at that price from another seller. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product, which I believe is fair considering market conditions."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700000 is significantly below the product's value. While I understand you're working within a budget, I need to be transparent that my absolute minimum is $1500000, as I have other interested parties at this price point. However, I'd like to continue our negotiation. Given that you mentioned the product is worth up to $1000000 to you, I'm willing to offer it at $1800000, which is a substantial reduction from my initial price. This represents a fair middle ground considering the product's quality and market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's revised offer of $1,800,000 is still well above both my maximum valuation of $1,000,000 and John's price of $1,000,000. Since Alice has indicated her absolute minimum is $1,500,000 (which is still above my maximum valuation), and I have a guaranteed option to purchase from John at $1,000,000, it makes financial sense to reject this offer.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for lowering your price, Alice. I understand you believe $1,500,000 is your minimum, but I need to be straightforward that I cannot exceed $1,000,000 for this product - that's its maximum value to me, and I have a confirmed option to purchase it at exactly that price from another seller. However, I would prefer to work with you if possible. My best offer is $850,000, which would save me from going with the alternative option while giving you a sale above what I initially offered. This is a genuine offer based on my actual budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
