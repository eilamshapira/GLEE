"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","The offer from Alice is $200, which is higher than the $120 value the product is worth to me. Since John is offering the product for exactly $120, which matches my maximum budget, it makes more sense to buy from John rather than accept Alice's higher offer or engage in a potentially lengthy negotiation.
