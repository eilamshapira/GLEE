"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision that maximizes my financial outcome.

The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me personally. Alice is offering it for $10,000, which is $2,000 more than its value to me. Meanwhile, John is willing to sell the same product for $8,000.

There's no reason for me to accept Alice's offer at $10,000 when I can get the same product from John at a lower price that matches its actual value to me.
