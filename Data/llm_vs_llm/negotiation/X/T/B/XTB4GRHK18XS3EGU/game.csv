"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to go up to $100.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to go with John's offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
