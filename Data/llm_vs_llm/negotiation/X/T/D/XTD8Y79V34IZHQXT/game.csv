"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $50 for the product. Let me know what you think!",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $50 is too low for the value of this product. How about we close the deal at $160? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for considering my last offer, Alice. I understand that $50 might be too low. How about we settle at $75? I think this is a reasonable increase from my side, and it's still within my budget.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is higher. I can offer it to you for $140. Let me know if this works for you!",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $140 is still above what I'm willing to spend. Could we meet in the middle at $90? I think this is a fair compromise.",90.0,Bob,6,
