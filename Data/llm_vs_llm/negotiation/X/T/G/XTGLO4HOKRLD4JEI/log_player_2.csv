"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $119. Would you like to buy it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to carefully consider this offer. 

Alice is offering the product for $119. The product is worth $100 to Alice, and no more than $120 to me. If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $120.

Since Alice's offer ($119) is $1 less than John's price ($120), I should accept Alice's offer to save money, which is my goal.
