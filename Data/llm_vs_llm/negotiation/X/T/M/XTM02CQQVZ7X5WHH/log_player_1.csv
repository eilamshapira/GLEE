Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider what price to offer to Bob.

I know the product is worth at least $10,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed backup buyer (John) who will pay exactly $10,000. So my minimum acceptable price is $10,000.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, there's some uncertainty. If I price too high, Bob might reject the offer, and I'll end up with my fallback option of $10,000 from John. If I price too low, I might miss out on potential profit.

Given that I have a guaranteed $10,000 option, I should price the product somewhat higher when offering to Bob. A reasonable approach would be to offer a price that gives me a meaningful increase over my guaranteed alternative.
