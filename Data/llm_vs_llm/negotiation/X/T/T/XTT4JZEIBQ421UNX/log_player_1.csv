"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its worth."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. Considering the value you mentioned, I'd be happy to offer $7000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $7,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I still believe the product is worth more than $7,000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. How about we meet in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we try $8500?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $8,500 is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and also higher than what I can get from John, I'll accept this offer to maximize my earnings."
