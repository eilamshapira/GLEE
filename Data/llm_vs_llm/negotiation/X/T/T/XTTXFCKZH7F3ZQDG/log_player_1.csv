"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 25000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $10,000, which is significantly below my minimum of $15,000, I will reject it and make a counteroffer.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 24000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a crucial point. Bob is now offering my minimum acceptable price. I have to weigh my options.

I could:

*   **Accept Bob's offer:** Guaranteeing a sale for $15,000.
*   **Sell to John:** Guaranteeing a sale for $15,000.
*   **Reject and Counteroffer:** Potentially get a higher price from Bob, but risk losing the sale altogether, or getting a lower price.

Since both options (1) and (3) provide the same outcome, selling the product to John in the current round ensures a certain profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation.
