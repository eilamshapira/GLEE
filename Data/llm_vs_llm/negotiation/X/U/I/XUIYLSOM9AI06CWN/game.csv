"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1750000 is significantly above my budget. While I appreciate the quality of the product, I would be willing to purchase it for $1100000. This is a fair offer that could work for both of us. Please let me know if this price works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer. However, $1100000 is significantly below what I can accept for this product. Its value to me is no less than $1500000, which happens to be what another buyer, John, is willing to pay. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can offer it to you for $1550000, which is only slightly above my minimum acceptable price. This represents good value considering the product's quality and worth.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
