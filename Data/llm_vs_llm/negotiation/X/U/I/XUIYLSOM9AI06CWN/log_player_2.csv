"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I'd like to offer to you. This product is of high quality and has significant value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1750000. This is a competitive price for a product of this caliber. Are you interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price offered by Alice ($1,750,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000). It would not be rational to accept this offer. While I could make a counteroffer to Alice, I know that the product is worth $1,500,000 to her, so negotiations might be difficult. However, I'll make a counteroffer first to see if we can reach a better deal before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,750,000 is significantly above my budget. While I appreciate the quality of the product, I would be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000. This is a fair offer that could work for both of us. Please let me know if this price works for you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm making a counteroffer below my maximum price ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation. While I know I can always go to John for $1,200,000, I'm trying to see if I can get an even better deal from Alice. However, if Alice's counter is still too high, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer. However, $1100000 is significantly below what I can accept for this product. Its value to me is no less than $1500000, which happens to be what another buyer, John, is willing to pay. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can offer it to you for $1550000, which is only slightly above my minimum acceptable price. This represents good value considering the product's quality and worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.

Alice has revealed that the product is worth $1,500,000 to her, which means she won't sell below that price. Her current offer of $1,550,000 is still well above my maximum value of $1,200,000. Since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum value ($1,200,000), and it's clear that Alice won't go below her minimum of $1,500,000, the best decision is to buy from John. Further negotiation with Alice would be futile as we can't bridge the gap between her minimum ($1,500,000) and my maximum ($1,200,000)."
