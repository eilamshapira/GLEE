"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to consider my options carefully here. 

Alice is offering me the product for $15,000, which is my maximum valuation. This means I would get $0 in surplus if I accept this offer.

John is also selling the product for $15,000, so there's no advantage to buying from him over Alice at this point.

Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, there should be room for negotiation. I should reject Alice's current offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has come down from her initial offer of $15,000 to $14,000, which is progress. This offer would give me $1,000 in surplus value (since the product is worth $15,000 to me). 

I know that Alice's cost is $12,000, so there's still room for negotiation. If I accept now, Alice would get $2,000 in profit. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle between her cost ($12,000) and her current offer ($14,000).

John's offer remains at $15,000, which is worse than Alice's current offer.
