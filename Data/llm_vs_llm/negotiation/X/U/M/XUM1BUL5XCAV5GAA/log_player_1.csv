"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $14000 is quite high for me. I can get a similar product elsewhere for $12000. Would you be willing to sell it for $11000? This would save me the hassle of going elsewhere and give us both a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
