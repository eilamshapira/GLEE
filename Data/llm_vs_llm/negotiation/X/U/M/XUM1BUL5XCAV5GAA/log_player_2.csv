"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $14000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer of $14,000 since it's higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000). I can try to negotiate with Alice for a better price, but if she doesn't come down significantly, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $14,000 is quite high for me. I can get a similar product elsewhere for $12,000. Would you be willing to sell it for $11,000? This would save me the hassle of going elsewhere and give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
