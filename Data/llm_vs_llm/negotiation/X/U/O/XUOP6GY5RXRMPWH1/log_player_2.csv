"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","The offer from Alice is $120, which is higher than the $80 value the product is worth to me. It also exceeds the price of $80 that John is offering.

Since I can get the same product from John for $80, which matches the maximum I'm willing to pay, I should choose the option that saves me the most money.
