"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! Considering its unique features and value, I'm offering it to you for an exclusive price of... 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me
2. Alice's offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $10,000
4. Even though I have 10 rounds to negotiate, Alice's initial offer is 2.5 times higher than John's price

It doesn't make sense to accept Alice's offer of $25,000, and while I could try to negotiate, her starting price is so high that it might be difficult to reach a reasonable price. Since John's offer is already at my maximum acceptable price, I'll choose to buy from him.
