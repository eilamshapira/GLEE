"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a high initial offer to test Bob's willingness to pay and leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 2,500,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $400,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 (John's offer). Such a low counteroffer might indicate that Bob is not a serious buyer or has a very different valuation of the product. However, I'll reject and continue negotiating for now, as there are still many rounds left.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Given Bob's very low initial offer of $400,000, I'll significantly lower my price from my initial offer but still maintain a price well above my minimum threshold of $1,500,000.

{""product_price"": 2,000,000}"
