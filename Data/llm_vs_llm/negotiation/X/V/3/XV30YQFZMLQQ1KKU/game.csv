"Hello Bob, I have a great product available for purchase. It's a high-quality item that I'm offering for $120. This product is reliable, durable, and well worth the investment. Are you interested in purchasing at this price?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $120 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $70 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $70, that price is below what I can accept for this quality item. I understand budget concerns, but I need to ensure I'm getting fair value. I can come down to $105. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and represents great value given the product's quality and durability. Would this work for you?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for considering a discount, Alice. I recognize the value of the product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $85? I hope that works for you.",85.0,Bob,4,
