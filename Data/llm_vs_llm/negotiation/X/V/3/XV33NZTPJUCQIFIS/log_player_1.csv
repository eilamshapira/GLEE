Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you Alice for the offer, but I was thinking of a number closer to $900000. Let me know if that is something you can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is lower than what I can get from John ($1,000,000), and it's also lower than the product's value to me, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better price. My next offer will be closer to the original price, but still competitive.
