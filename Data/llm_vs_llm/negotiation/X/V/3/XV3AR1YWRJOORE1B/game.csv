"Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to acquire this truly exceptional product. Given its unique qualities and potential benefits for you, I'm initially offering it at $3000000. I believe this price reflects its intrinsic value and the significant return you'll see on your investment.",3000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the potential of the product, I find the current asking price to be quite steep. I'm looking to maximize my return on investment, and given my budget constraints, I'd like to offer $500000 for the product. I believe this price point reflects a more feasible investment for me while still acknowledging the product's value.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your desire to maximize your return, but $500000 is significantly below my bottom line. While I can't accept that, I am willing to come down. How about we meet in the middle-ish? I'll offer it to you for $2500000. This reflects a substantial reduction from my initial offer and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.",2500000.0,Alice,3,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2500000 is still considerably higher than what I'm looking to invest. In an effort to find a more mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to raise my offer to $750000. This is rather a significant price to me.",750000.0,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that we're both trying to find a fair deal here. However, I'm constrained by my budget and the need to ensure a sound investment. In light of this, I'm willing to raise my offer to $850000. This is a significant increase from my previous offers and I hope it shows my commitment to finding a agreeable solution for the both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but we are still quite far apart. Given the product's inherent value and the alternative offer I have, I'm finding it difficult to go much lower. However, I value your interest. I'll make one more significant concession and offer it to you for $2000000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go for now. I hope you'll consider it.",2000000.0,Alice,5,
