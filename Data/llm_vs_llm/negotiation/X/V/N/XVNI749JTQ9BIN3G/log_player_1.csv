Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a great product to offer you. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $180?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $180 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $150.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Let me think about this:
1. Bob's offer of $150 is reasonable and well above my minimum value of $120
2. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Bob might lose interest
3. John's guaranteed offer of $120 is less attractive than Bob's current offer
4. $150 represents a good profit margin above my minimum value

Given these considerations, I'll accept Bob's offer since it's a fair price and provides a good profit.
