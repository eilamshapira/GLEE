"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $17000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $10000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and uniqueness, I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $16000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $12500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering I have another option to purchase the product from John for $12000.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable with $12500, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make one final compromise and offer it to you for $14000. If this price doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,5,
