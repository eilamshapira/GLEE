"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I understand the value, but considering my alternative option and budget constraints, Iâ€™d like to propose $8500 for the product. Let me know if we can work with this number. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $8,500 is too close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and I know the product is worth $10,000 to Bob. There's still room for negotiation to reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot go that low. This product has significant value, and my best price would be $9,200. This is already a considerable reduction from my initial offer and represents good value given the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 9200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your flexibility, but considering my budget constraints, I can go up to $8900. I believe this is a fair offer for both of us. Let me know if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $8,900. This is a reasonable compromise as it's significantly better than John's offer of $8,000, and we've been moving closer to a middle ground. While it's less than my initial target, it represents a good profit margin, and continuing the negotiation might risk Bob walking away or becoming frustrated. This is a satisfactory outcome given the circumstances."
