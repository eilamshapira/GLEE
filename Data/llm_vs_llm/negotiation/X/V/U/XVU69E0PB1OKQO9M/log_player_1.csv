Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","$100 is above my minimum acceptable price ($80), but given that the product is worth $150 to Bob, I believe there's room for a better deal. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still aim for a good profit, trying to meet somewhere in the middle between Bob's $100 offer and my initial $130.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","$115 is a good offer - it's closer to my initial target and represents a fair compromise between our positions. Since we're already in round 4 and the risk of not reaching a deal increases with each round, I'll accept this offer. It gives me a good profit above my minimum price of $80.
