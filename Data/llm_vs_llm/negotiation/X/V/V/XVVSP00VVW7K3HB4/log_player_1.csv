Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** While Bob only values the product at $100, starting with an offer closer to your minimum ($150) allows room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for Bob to counter-offer:**  The offer of $125 gives Bob the opportunity to counter-offer, potentially landing on a price higher than $100 but lower than $150.
* **Ensuring a profit:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150. 

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still offering Bob a chance to buy the product."
