"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $50 for the product. What do you think?",50.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $50 is far too low.  It's worth a lot more than that to me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  It's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $125 is still more than I'm hoping to spend.  How about $70? That's a significant jump from my previous offer.",70.0,Bob,4,
