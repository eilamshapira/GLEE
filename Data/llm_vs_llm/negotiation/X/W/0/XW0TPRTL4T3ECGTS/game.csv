"Hello Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. While I recognize the value of your product, that initial price is a bit high for my budget.  I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $100000. Let me know what you think.",100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $100000 is significantly lower than what I'd consider. This product has the potential to be a real game-changer. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $2000000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $2000000 is still far outside my price range. To be frank, I'm working with a much tighter budget.  I could go up to $200000.  If that's not workable, I might need to explore other options.",200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point, but that price doesn't reflect the true value of what's on offer here. I'm willing to come down to $1800000, but I can't go any lower than that. This is a significant discount already, and I'm confident it will prove to be a wise investment on your end.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still too far apart. I'm serious about my budget constraints.  Would you consider $300000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in the product.  ",300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price, but the gap is still too wide. I'm willing to make my final offer at $1600000.  This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.  Let me know if you're interested, otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
