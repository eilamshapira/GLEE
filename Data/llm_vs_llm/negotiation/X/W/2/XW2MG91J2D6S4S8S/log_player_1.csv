Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:

Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I certainly can't go as low as $500,000, but I'm willing to negotiate. How about we set the price at $1,200,000? This way, both parties can benefit from the deal."

I'm afraid we couldn't reach an agreement that reflects the true value of the product. I have decided to sell the product to another buyer, John, who has offered to purchase it for $1,000,000. I appreciate your interest and the time you invested in this negotiation. If you have any other offers or opportunities in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you."
