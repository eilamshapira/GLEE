"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Looking at the offer:

1. Alice is offering the product for $120
2. The product is worth no more than $80 to me (Bob)
3. I can buy the same product from John for $80

Alice's offer ($120) exceeds both the product's worth to me ($80) and John's alternative price ($80). It wouldn't make financial sense to pay $40 more than the product's value to me.
