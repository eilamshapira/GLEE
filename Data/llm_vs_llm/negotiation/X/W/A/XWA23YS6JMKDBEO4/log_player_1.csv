(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is still below John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000. Since Bob has increased his offer from $800,000 to $1,000,000, he shows willingness to negotiate upward, but we're still not at an acceptable price point.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make another counteroffer in the next round, lowering my price somewhat but still keeping it above John's offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still below John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000. While Bob continues to increase his offers, we're now in round 6 of 10, and he's still not matching John's price. Given that we're past the halfway point in negotiations and Bob hasn't yet reached my minimum acceptable price, I'll take the guaranteed offer from John to avoid any risk.
