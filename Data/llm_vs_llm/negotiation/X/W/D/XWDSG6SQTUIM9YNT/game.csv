"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity. This product is truly one-of-a-kind and I believe it will be a game-changer for you. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1750000.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1750000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can offer $400000 at this time as I have a reliable alternative at $800000.",400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $400000 is far below the product's intrinsic value and what I know it can bring to you. I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down from my initial price, because I believe you're the right person for this product, but I also need to make sure the deal makes sense for my business. How about $1500000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your understanding, Alice. Your continued willingness to negotiate is appreciated. While $1500000 is a significant decrease, it's still beyond my maximum budget for this purchase. How about we settle at $600000? I believe this is a fair offer given my budget constraints.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer. I also want to be fair, and I understand you have a budget. However, I have an alternative offer from John for $1000000. I'm willing to give you a better deal because I think you'll get more value out of this product, but I can't go below that. My counteroffer is $1250000.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that $1250000 is the lowest you can go at this moment, and I appreciate your effort to offer me a better deal than John. However, I have a strict budget limit of $800000, and I'm ready to close the deal at that amount right now. Can we meet closer to my number? I can offer $700000 to make this work for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,6,
