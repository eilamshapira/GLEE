"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this exclusive product for $150. Let me know if that works for you. If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to sell the product for $100 to another buyer. This means the product is worth less than $100 to her. By rejecting her offer, I can buy the product from John for $150, saving myself $50 compared to Alice's offer."
