"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Based on the information provided, the product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me (Bob). Alice is offering the product for $2,300,000, which exceeds my maximum valuation. Meanwhile, John is offering the same product for $1,500,000, which matches my maximum acceptable price.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, the logical choice is to buy from John rather than accept Alice's higher-priced offer.
