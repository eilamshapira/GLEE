"Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but $1200000 is significantly below its inherent worth to both of us. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower the price to $1650000. This represents a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to make this deal happen.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
