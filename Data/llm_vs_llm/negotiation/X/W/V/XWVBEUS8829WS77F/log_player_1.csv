"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm happy with the $10,000 offer, it's worth exploring if I can get more.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm going to lower my price slightly, but still keeping it above my minimum. Hopefully, Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me in the middle."
