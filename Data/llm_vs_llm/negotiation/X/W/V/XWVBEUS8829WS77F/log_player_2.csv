"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll analyze this situation:

Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which is exactly the same price that John is offering and also the maximum value the product has to me.

Since Alice's price matches John's price, and I want to save as much money as possible, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer that's lower than $15,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer significantly below the $15,000 price point to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": $10,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her price to $12,000, which is $3,000 less than both her initial offer and John's fixed price. This is a significant improvement that would save me money.

I could try to negotiate further, but Alice has already made a substantial concession. Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and this offer already saves me $3,000 compared to buying from John, I'll accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
