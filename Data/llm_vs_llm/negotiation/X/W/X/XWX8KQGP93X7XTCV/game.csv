"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I believe $1800000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $1000000 as it's significantly below the product's value. I want to work with you, but I need to ensure the price reflects the product's worth. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1600000, which is a fair value considering the product's quality and market position.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1600000 is still beyond what I'm prepared to spend. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000, which I believe is a fair compromise given my budget constraints. Let me know if this is something you can work with.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
