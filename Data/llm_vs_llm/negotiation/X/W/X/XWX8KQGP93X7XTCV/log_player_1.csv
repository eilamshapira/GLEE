Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,800,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential value."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I believe $1800000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but if we can't reach an agreement closer to my target price, I always have the option to sell to John at $1,500,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $1,000,000 as it's significantly below the product's value. I want to work with you, but I need to ensure the price reflects the product's worth.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1600000 is still beyond what I'm prepared to spend. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000, which I believe is a fair compromise given my budget constraints. Let me know if this is something you can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Given that Bob's latest offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and considering that we seem to be far apart in our valuations, I'll take the guaranteed offer from John at $1,500,000. This ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price and avoids further prolonged negotiations that may not reach a satisfactory conclusion."
