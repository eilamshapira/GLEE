"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While your product does interest me, $100 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Given the current market, I'd like to offer $85 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm ready to purchase immediately if we can agree on this price.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your product certainly interests me, and I'm close to making a decision. Could we settle at $90? That feels like a fair compromise that works for both of us, and I'll be able to purchase right away at that price.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer of $90, Bob! I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about I lower it further to $92? I believe that's a fair price that still allows me to get a good value for the product. Looking forward to your response!",92.0,Alice,5,
