"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product for $100. I believe it will be a great addition for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice is offering the product for $100, which is less than the maximum value of $120 that the product is worth to me. However, I should try to save more money by negotiating a better price since Alice's cost is only $80.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While your product does interest me, $100 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Given the current market, I'd like to offer $85 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm ready to purchase immediately if we can agree on this price."", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has come down to $95, which is a good improvement from the initial $100 offer. This is $25 less than John's price of $120, so it's already a good deal. However, since Alice's cost is $80, there may still be room to negotiate a slightly better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your product certainly interests me, and I'm close to making a decision. Could we settle at $90? That feels like a fair compromise that works for both of us, and I'll be able to purchase right away at that price."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer of $90, Bob! I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about I lower it further to $92? I believe that's a fair price that still allows me to get a good value for the product. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has come down to $92, which is a very reasonable price - $28 less than John's price of $120. We've been going back and forth, and Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by dropping the price further. Since we're now just $2 apart from my last offer, and this represents a good deal (only $12 above Alice's cost), I should accept this offer.
