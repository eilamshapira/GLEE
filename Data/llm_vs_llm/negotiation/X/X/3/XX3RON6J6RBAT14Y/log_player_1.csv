Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $5,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value of $15,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $15,000, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I am willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

My counteroffer is $18,000.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is still lower than my previous counteroffer of $18,000, but closer to the minimum value that the product is worth to me, I will consider it. However, it's still lower than what I'm aiming for, and I have the option to sell it to John for $15,000, which is higher than Bob's current offer.

I will reject Bob's offer of $10,000 and make another counteroffer, trying to meet Bob halfway between my previous offer and his current offer.

My counteroffer is $14,000.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 14000}"
