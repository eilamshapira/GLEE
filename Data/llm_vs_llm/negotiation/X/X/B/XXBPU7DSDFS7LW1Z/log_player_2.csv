"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Okay, I need to make a decision. Here's my thought process:

*   **Alice's offer:** $150.
*   **My value:** The product is worth $100 to me.
*   **Buying from John:** $100.

Since the offer from Alice is $150, which is more than I value the product and more expensive than buying from John, I should not accept it. Therefore, I should consider either rejecting Alice's offer or buying it from John.

Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $100, I should choose this option as it's within my budget and guarantees I get the product I want.

Therefore, the best decision is to buy from John.
