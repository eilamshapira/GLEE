,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm happy to offer $10000, which is my maximum budget. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit though.  How about $13000? This is a great price considering the value of this product. ",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $13000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $11500. I'm hoping we can find common ground here.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to hear you're willing to increase your offer, and $11500 is getting closer.  I'm feeling a bit more flexible at this point, so I'm willing to come down to $12500.  What do you think?  ",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $12000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned.  Let's finalize this deal.",12000.0,Bob,6,
