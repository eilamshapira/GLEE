"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10500.  It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Reason: The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $10,500 exceeds that value. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $10,000, which is within my budget, I will reject Alice's offer."
