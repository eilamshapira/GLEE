"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate that you've started with a reasonable price, and I'm definitely interested in the product. However, I was hoping we could find a middle ground that works better for both of us. Would you consider $1000000 for the product? This would still represent a substantial purchase, and I'm ready to move forward quickly at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $1000000. I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to come down from my initial price, but I still believe the product is worth more. I'd like to propose a price of $1100000. This price reflects the product's value and takes into account your enthusiasm for it. I'm open to further discussion, but I hope we can meet at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
