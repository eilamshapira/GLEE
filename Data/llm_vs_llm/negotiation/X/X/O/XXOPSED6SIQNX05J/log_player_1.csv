Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate that you've started with a reasonable price, and I'm definitely interested in the product. However, I was hoping we could find a middle ground that works better for both of us. Would you consider $1000000 for the product? This would still represent a substantial purchase, and I'm ready to move forward quickly at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $1,000,000 because it's lower than my initial offer, and I believe the product is worth more. I'd like to make a counteroffer to see if we can meet at a higher price. 

My counteroffer is: $1,100,000. This price is still below my initial offer, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $1,000,000. I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to come down from my initial price, but I still believe the product is worth more. I'd like to propose a price of $1,100,000. This price reflects the product's value and takes into account your enthusiasm for it. I'm open to further discussion, but I hope we can meet at this price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
