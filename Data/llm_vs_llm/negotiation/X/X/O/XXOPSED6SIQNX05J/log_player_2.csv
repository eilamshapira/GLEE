"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's offer is $1,200,000
2. John's fixed price is $1,500,000
3. My maximum value for the product is $1,500,000
4. We have 10 rounds of negotiation available

Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is already below my maximum value and significantly better than John's price ($300,000 less). However, since this is the first round and Alice mentioned she's ""open to negotiations,"" there might be room to negotiate for an even better price.

Given that Alice's opening offer is already quite reasonable but there's potential for a better deal, I'll reject this offer to try negotiating for a lower price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably lower but still respectful of Alice's initial offer. Since her opening price was $1,200,000, I'll try to negotiate down while maintaining a professional tone.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate that you've started with a reasonable price, and I'm definitely interested in the product. However, I was hoping we could find a middle ground that works better for both of us. Would you consider $1,000,000 for the product? This would still represent a substantial purchase, and I'm ready to move forward quickly at this price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $1000000. I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to come down from my initial price, but I still believe the product is worth more. I'd like to propose a price of $1100000. This price reflects the product's value and takes into account your enthusiasm for it. I'm open to further discussion, but I hope we can meet at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze this updated situation:

1. Original offer from Alice: $1,200,000
2. My counteroffer: $1,000,000
3. Alice's new offer: $1,100,000
4. John's fixed price: $1,500,000
5. My maximum value: $1,500,000

Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate by reducing her price by $100,000, meeting me halfway between her original offer and my counteroffer. This is a good sign and represents significant savings ($400,000 less than John's price).

While there might be room for one more round of negotiation, there are several reasons to accept this offer:
1. It's a fair compromise between our positions
2. It's significantly below my maximum value
3. Alice's tone suggests this is a carefully considered price
4. We risk losing momentum if we push too hard
5. The savings compared to John's price are substantial

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer.
