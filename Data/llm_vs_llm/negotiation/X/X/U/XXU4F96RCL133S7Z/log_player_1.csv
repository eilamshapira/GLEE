"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start with a high offer to maximize my potential earnings. Considering the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, I'll start with an even higher price.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $750,000 is lower than the minimum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $1,000,000, I will reject Bob's offer. However, I will not sell it to John yet, as I want to try to get a better price from Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $750,000, which is lower than my minimum acceptable price, I'll make a counteroffer that is still high but slightly lower than my initial offer to show that I'm willing to negotiate.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's new offer of $775,000 is still lower than the minimum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me. Since I have the option to sell it to John for $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's offer, I will reject Bob's offer again. I will not sell it to John yet, as I want to try to get a better price from Bob or see if he is willing to meet me closer to my desired price.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer increased by $25,000 from $750,000 to $775,000, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my previous one, but still higher than Bob's current offer, to encourage further negotiation.

Although he is getting closer, the difference is still significant. Since I have the option to sell it to John for $1,000,000, which is substantially higher than Bob's offer, I will reject Bob's offer again. I will try to make another counteroffer to see if Bob is willing to increase his price further.
