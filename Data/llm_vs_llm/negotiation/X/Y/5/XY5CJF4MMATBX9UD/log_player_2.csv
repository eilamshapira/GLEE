"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer ($2,000,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's guaranteed price ($800,000), the best decision is to buy from John. There's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice when her initial offer is more than twice what I can get elsewhere."
