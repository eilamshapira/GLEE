"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me think about this:
1. The product is worth no more than $120 to me (my maximum value)
2. Alice's current offer is $100
3. John's fixed price is $120
4. Alice's cost is $80, so there's room for negotiation

Alice's offer of $100 is better than John's $120, but since this is just the first round and Alice's cost is $80, I believe I can negotiate for a better price. It's worth trying to get a lower price through a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Let me make a strategic counteroffer. Since Alice's cost is $80 and her initial offer was $100, I'll propose a price that's still profitable for her but more favorable to me.

{""product_price"": 85}

This offer:
1. Is above Alice's cost of $80, so she can still make a profit
2. Is significantly lower than her initial offer of $100
3. Gives me room for negotiation if she counteroffers
4. Would save me $35 compared to John's price of $120"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:
1. Alice has dropped her price from $100 to $95
2. This shows she's willing to negotiate and move down in price
3. We still have 7 rounds left for negotiation
4. The gap between her cost ($80) and current offer ($95) is still considerable
5. $95 is still much better than John's $120

Since Alice has shown willingness to reduce the price and we have several rounds left, I think there's still room to negotiate for a better price. The movement from $100 to $95 suggests we might be able to get it lower.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved from $100 to $95, and rejected my previous offer of $85, I'll try to meet her closer to the middle. I'll increase my previous offer but still try to get a good deal.

{""product_price"": 88}

This offer:
1. Shows I'm willing to move up from my previous offer of $85
2. Still gives Alice a reasonable profit margin above her $80 cost
3. Is a noticeable movement toward her price, which might encourage further negotiation
4. Maintains room for future negotiation if needed
5. Would still save me significantly compared to both her last offer ($95) and John's price ($120)"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let's analyze the progression:
1. Alice's offers: $100 → $95 → $92
2. My offers: $85 → $88
3. Alice is consistently lowering her price
4. The gap is narrowing ($92 vs my last offer of $88)
5. We still have 5 rounds left
6. $92 is much better than John's $120

Alice continues to show flexibility by lowering her price. Since she's moving down steadily and we still have several rounds left, I think there's still opportunity to negotiate a slightly better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has been moving down consistently, and I've been moving up. The gap is getting smaller. I'll make another step up to show good faith in reaching a middle ground.

{""product_price"": 90}

This offer:
1. Moves up $2 from my last offer of $88, matching Alice's $2 reduction
2. Shows I'm willing to compromise
3. Still gives me a good deal compared to John's $120
4. Leaves Alice with a $10 profit margin from her $80 cost
5. Is only $2 less than her last offer, making it more likely she'll accept or make a final small counter

The gap is now very small ($2) and this feels like a fair price for both parties."
