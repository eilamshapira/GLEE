"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. Given its rarity and high demand, I believe it's worth a premium price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000, which I think is a fair value considering its unique features and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'll analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $950,000
2. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
3. John is willing to sell it for $800,000
4. Alice's initial offer is significantly above both my maximum value and John's price

Since Alice's offer ($950,000) is higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000), it would not make sense to accept it. While I could make a counteroffer, I'm confident Alice's initial high offer suggests she might not be willing to go as low as $800,000 quickly. Since John's price matches my maximum value and is significantly better than Alice's current offer, the most rational decision would be to buy from John.
