"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115. Would you like to buy it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'm evaluating Alice's offer of $115 against my alternatives.

The product is worth up to $120 to me, and if I reject Alice's offer, I would buy from John for $120.

Since Alice's price ($115) is $5 less than John's price ($120), it makes financial sense to accept Alice's offer and save $5.
