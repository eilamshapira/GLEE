"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $200 is significantly above my budget. I have another seller offering the same product for $150. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $120? This would be a fair price that works within my budget.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and the effort to work with me. I do want to be upfront—another buyer is ready to pay $150. However, since I’d like to make this deal work with you, I'm offering the product for $175. Let me know if this is a fair compromise for you.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price. However, as you mentioned someone else is willing to pay $150, and I actually have another seller (John) offering the exact same price. To make it worth choosing you over the other options, I would need a better price. Would you consider $135? This would give you a quick sale, and I could make the purchase right away.",135.0,Bob,4,
