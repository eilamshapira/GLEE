Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $200 is significantly above my budget. I have another seller offering the same product for $150.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price. However, as you mentioned someone else is willing to pay $150, and I actually have another seller (John) offering the exact same price.
