"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Here's my reasoning:

*   **My Valuation:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to me (since I can buy it from John for that price).
*   **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $1,150,000, which is more expensive than buying from John.
*   **Decision:** I should buy from John.

Therefore, the best decision is:

```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```"
