"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit higher than I was hoping for. I can offer $50 for the product.",50.0,Bob,2,
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob, but $50 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'll counter with $225. Let me know if this works for you!",225.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. How about we settle at $200? This is a fair price considering the quality and benefits of the product.",200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your perspective, but I still find that price a bit steep. I'm willing to increase my offer to $60. Let's see if we can find some middle ground.",60.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $60 is still too low for me. Let's try to meet in the middle. How about $180? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and should reflect a fair compromise.",180.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're still a bit apart on the price. I'm willing to come down further to $170. This is a good deal considering the value of the product, and I hope it aligns more closely with your budget.",170.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I do appreciate your flexibility, but I need to stick to my budget. I can offer $70 for the product. Hope we can reach an agreement.",70.0,Bob,6,
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $70 is still below what I can accept. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $160? This is very close to my minimum acceptable price and should be a fair compromise.",160.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but I need to stay firm on the value of the product. I can go down to $155. This is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you.",155.0,Alice,7,
