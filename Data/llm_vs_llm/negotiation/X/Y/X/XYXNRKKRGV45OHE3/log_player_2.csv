"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique and valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I am offering it at $2500000. This is a fair price considering the product's inherent value and potential returns. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's asking for $2,500,000 for the product, but I know that:
1. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
2. John (an alternative seller) is willing to sell the same product for $800,000

Alice's asking price of $2,500,000 is significantly higher than the product's value to me, and also much higher than my alternative option with John. Since I can get the exact same product from John for $800,000, which matches my maximum valuation, it makes the most financial sense to go with that option.
