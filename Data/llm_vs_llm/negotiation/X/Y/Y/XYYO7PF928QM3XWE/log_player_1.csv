Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to think strategically about this. The product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price. Bob values it at $1,200,000, so he won't pay more than that.

Since I already have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John, there's no benefit for me to sell to Bob for less than that amount. If I offer Bob any price above $1,200,000, he will reject it since that exceeds his valuation. If I offer him any price below $1,500,000, I would be losing money compared to selling to John.

The rational choice is to offer Bob a price that ensures I get my minimum value:

{""product_price"": 1500000}"
