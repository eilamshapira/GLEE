"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $70 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80, I will reject his offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you have a certain budget in mind, but I'm afraid $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a fair price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I think that's a reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 92.50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your counteroffer. How about we settle at $80? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","This is an interesting turn of events. Bob's new offer of $80 is exactly the same price that John is willing to pay, and it's also my minimum acceptable price.

In this case, I don't see any advantage in continuing to negotiate with Bob, as I can get the same price from John without any further risk or effort.
