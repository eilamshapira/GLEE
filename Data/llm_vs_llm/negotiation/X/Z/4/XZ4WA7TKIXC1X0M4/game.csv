"Hello Bob, I hope you're doing well. I'm offering you a unique product that I believe can bring value to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you at $20000. This product is worth every penny of this investment. Would you be interested?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $20000 is beyond my budget. The product is worth no more than $15000 to me, and I have an alternative option to purchase it for that price from another seller. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider selling it for $12000? This would give us both a fair deal and allow us to work together.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your interest in doing business with me. While I understand budget constraints, I need to consider the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down from my initial price, but $12000 is below what I can accept given that I have a standing offer of $15000 from another buyer. However, I'd also prefer to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $17500? This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my genuine interest in working with you.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I understand you're trying to find middle ground, but I need to be transparent - this product is worth no more than $15000 to me, and I have a standing offer from John to purchase it at exactly that price. However, I'd still prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer $13500, which would save me some money compared to my alternative while still giving you a reasonable price considering your cost. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your transparency. I understand your position that the product is worth $15000 to you, which aligns with what John is willing to pay me. However, there seems to be some confusion - John is actually offering to buy from me at $15000, not selling to you at that price. Given this reality, selling to you at $13500 would mean I'm leaving money on the table compared to my alternative. If we're going to make a deal, I need at least what my alternative option offers. I can sell to you at $15500, which is only slightly above your maximum value but still represents a substantial reduction from my initial offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
