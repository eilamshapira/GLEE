Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I hope you're doing well. I'm offering you a unique product that I believe can bring value to you.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $20000 is beyond my budget. The product is worth no more than $15000 to me, and I have an alternative option to purchase it for that price from another seller. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider selling it for $12000? This would give us both a fair deal and allow us to work together. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your interest in doing business with me. While I understand budget constraints, I need to consider the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down from my initial price, but $12,000 is below what I can accept given that I have a standing offer of $15,000 from another buyer. However, I'd also prefer to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500? This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my genuine interest in working with you."", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I understand you're trying to find middle ground, but I need to be transparent - this product is worth no more than $15000 to me, and I have a standing offer from John to purchase it at exactly that price. However, I'd still prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer $13500, which would save me some money compared to my alternative while still giving you a reasonable price considering your cost. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your transparency. I understand your position that the product is worth $15,000 to you, which aligns with what John is willing to pay me. However, there seems to be some confusion - John is actually offering to buy from me at $15,000, not selling to you at that price. Given this reality, selling to you at $13,500 would mean I'm leaving money on the table compared to my alternative. If we're going to make a deal, I need at least what my alternative option offers. I can sell to you at $15,500, which is only slightly above your maximum value but still represents a substantial reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 15500}"
