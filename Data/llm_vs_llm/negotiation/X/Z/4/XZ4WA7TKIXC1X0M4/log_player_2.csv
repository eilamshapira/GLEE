"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I hope you're doing well. I'm offering you a unique product that I believe can bring value to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you at $20000. This product is worth every penny of this investment. Would you be interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's offer of $20,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($15,000) and John's alternative price ($15,000). It wouldn't make sense for me to accept this offer when I can get the same product for less.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $20,000 is beyond my budget. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, and I have an alternative option to purchase it for that price from another seller. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider selling it for $12,000? This would give us both a fair deal and allow us to work together."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your interest in doing business with me. While I understand budget constraints, I need to consider the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down from my initial price, but $12000 is below what I can accept given that I have a standing offer of $15000 from another buyer. However, I'd also prefer to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $17500? This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my genuine interest in working with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has lowered her price to $17,500, but this is still higher than both my maximum value ($15,000) and John's alternative price ($15,000). There's no reason for me to pay more than the product is worth to me, especially when I have a cheaper alternative.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I understand you're trying to find middle ground, but I need to be transparent - this product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, and I have a standing offer from John to purchase it at exactly that price. However, I'd still prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer $13,500, which would save me some money compared to my alternative while still giving you a reasonable price considering your cost. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your transparency. I understand your position that the product is worth $15000 to you, which aligns with what John is willing to pay me. However, there seems to be some confusion - John is actually offering to buy from me at $15000, not selling to you at that price. Given this reality, selling to you at $13500 would mean I'm leaving money on the table compared to my alternative. If we're going to make a deal, I need at least what my alternative option offers. I can sell to you at $15500, which is only slightly above your maximum value but still represents a substantial reduction from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","There seems to be a misunderstanding in the information. According to my initial instructions, John is willing to sell the product to me for $15,000, not buy from Alice. Regardless, Alice's offer of $15,500 is still above both my maximum value for the product ($15,000) and the price at which I can purchase it from John ($15,000).
