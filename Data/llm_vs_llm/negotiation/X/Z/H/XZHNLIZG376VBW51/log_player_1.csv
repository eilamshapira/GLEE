Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer, I must point out that $600,000 is significantly below the product's value. The product is worth at least $800,000, which I know for certain. I already have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $800,000. However, I'd prefer to sell to you if we can agree on a fair price. I can come down to $950,000, which I believe represents good value given the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 950000}"

# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950000. However, considering the product's value to me and the fact that John is willing to pay $800000, I'm still a bit short of meeting you at that price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750000, which I believe is a fair compromise. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.
