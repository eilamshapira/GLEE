Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer, I must point out that $600000 is significantly below the product's value. The product is worth at least $800000, which I know for certain. I already have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $800000. However, I'd prefer to sell to you if we can agree on a fair price. I can come down to $950000, which I believe represents good value given the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
