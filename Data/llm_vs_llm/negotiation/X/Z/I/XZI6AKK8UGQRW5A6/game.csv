"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm asking for $2300000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price point that is more aligned with my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $1000000 significantly undervalues the product's worth. I'm willing to come down to $2000000. This price reflects the true value and potential this product holds.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice. However, I am looking for a more competitive price. Would you consider $1200000? This price point aligns better with my budget and the value I see in the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While $1200000 is still below what I hoped for, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet halfway at $1600000?  This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's true worth.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"We're indeed getting closer, Alice. However, I need to keep the price within my budget constraints. How about $1350000? This price recognizes the product's value while also being feasible for me.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price.  Therefore, my final offer is $1525000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it reflects the value of this deal for both of us.",1525000.0,Alice,7,
