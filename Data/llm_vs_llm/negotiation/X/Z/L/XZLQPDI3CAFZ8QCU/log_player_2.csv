"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my premium product to you for $20000. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that $20000 is a bit high for you, but $10000 is too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $15000. This is a fair price for the product's quality and value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 
At this point, Alice is meeting my maximum price. There's no guarantee I can negotiate further down, and John's offer is the same price. It's best to accept and secure the product."
