"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be perfect for you. Given its market value and unique features, I'm offering it at $2100000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth and potential value to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $2,100,000, which is $600,000 more than my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $1,500,000, which matches my maximum value
4. While I could try to negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, her initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum value, suggesting she might have unrealistic expectations

Since Alice's offer is substantially above my maximum value ($1,500,000), and John is offering the exact same product at my maximum acceptable price, it would be most logical to buy from John rather than engage in potentially lengthy negotiations with Alice.
