"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'm considering Alice's offer of $120 for the product. Since this is already below the $150 maximum value the product is worth to me, and also below John's fixed price of $150, this seems like a good offer.

If I reject and make a counteroffer, I might get a better price, but there's also a risk that negotiations could break down or end up with a higher price later.

Given that $120 is already a $30 savings compared to buying from John, I'll accept this offer.
