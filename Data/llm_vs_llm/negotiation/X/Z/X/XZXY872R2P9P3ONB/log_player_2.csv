"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to decide if Alice's offer is reasonable, or if I should try to negotiate a better price.

Alice's offer: $1,200,000
My maximum value: $1,500,000
Alice's cost: $1,000,000
John's price: $1,500,000

The current offer is $300,000 less than my maximum price and $200,000 more than Alice's cost. This gives me room to negotiate, as Alice still has profit margin. John's offer is my fallback but at my maximum price, so there's no advantage to going with John right now.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This gives me a chance to save more money.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but gives me more savings than Alice's initial offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I see that Alice has come down from her initial offer of $1,200,000 to $1,150,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This new price is $350,000 below my maximum value and still gives Alice a $150,000 profit from her cost.

My previous counteroffer of $1,050,000 was rejected, but Alice has moved $50,000 in my direction. This suggests we might be able to meet somewhere in the middle.

Since Alice has shown willingness to negotiate and her current offer is significantly better than John's price of $1,500,000, I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a better agreement.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I notice that Alice and I are getting closer in our negotiation:
- Alice started at $1,200,000
- Then came down to $1,150,000
- And now is offering $1,125,000

Meanwhile, I've moved from:
- $1,050,000 to
- $1,100,000

Alice's current offer of $1,125,000 is a good compromise - it's only $25,000 above my last offer, and it's $375,000 less than John's price of $1,500,000. Alice is still making a profit of $125,000 above her cost, which is reasonable.

Given that we're converging and the current offer represents significant savings compared to my maximum price, I'll accept this offer.
