"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is higher than the minimum amount I'm willing to accept ($800,000) but lower than the value Bob has for the product ($1,200,000), I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try to get a better price.

My counteroffer will be $1,100,000.

I will reject Bob's offer and make a new counteroffer of $1,050,000, which is still lower than the value Bob has for the product, but higher than his current offer.
