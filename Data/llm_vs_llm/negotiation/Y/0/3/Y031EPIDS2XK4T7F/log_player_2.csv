"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer is the same as John's price ($1,200,000), and it's the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. There's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice, especially since the product is worth $800,000 to her, giving room for negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice and $1,200,000 is my maximum value, I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation. A reasonable starting point would be closer to Alice's value but with some margin for her profit.

{""product_price"": 900000}

This offer gives Alice a $100,000 profit margin from her value ($800,000) while still being significantly lower than my maximum price ($1,200,000), leaving room for negotiation if she counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced her price by $100,000 from her initial offer, which shows she's willing to negotiate. The current offer of $1,100,000 is better than John's price of $1,200,000, but there might still be room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, I think we can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still try to get a better deal than Alice's $1,100,000. I'll aim for a middle ground between my last offer ($900,000) and her current offer ($1,100,000).

{""product_price"": 1000000}

This offer of $1,000,000 represents a significant increase from my previous offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate in good faith. It would give Alice a $200,000 profit from her value ($800,000), while still saving me $200,000 compared to John's price. It's a reasonable compromise that could be attractive to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has now lowered her price to $1,050,000, which is a good offer. She moved down $50,000 from her previous offer of $1,100,000, meeting me halfway between our last positions. This price gives her a reasonable profit ($250,000 above her value) while saving me $150,000 compared to John's price. Given the pattern of negotiations, continuing might risk Alice becoming less flexible, and we've reached a fair middle ground.
