"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your consideration. I believe the product's value is substantial, but I think a fair price would be closer to $1200000. Let's try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1200000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This gives us both a fair profit and allows us to move forward with this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1300000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value and our negotiation so far. Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1300000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1325000.  This is a fair compromise that I believe will make us both happy.  Let's close this deal and move on.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
