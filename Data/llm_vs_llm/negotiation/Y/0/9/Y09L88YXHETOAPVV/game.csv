"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I can offer $6000, which I believe is a fair price. Let me know if this works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me. Unfortunately, $6000 is too low for this product. Given its value and features, I can lower my initial offer and propose a price of $13500. I believe this is a fair value for both of us. Let me know if this can work for you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for lowering your price, Alice, but $13500 is still much higher than what I can justify paying for this product. I can increase my previous offer to $7000. This is a substantial increase from my last offer and reflects my sincere interest in making this deal work. Please let me know if this could work for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
