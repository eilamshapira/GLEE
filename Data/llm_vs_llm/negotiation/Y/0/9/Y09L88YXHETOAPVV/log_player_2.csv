"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $15000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Clearly, Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative price ($8,000). It wouldn't make sense to accept this offer as it would result in a substantial loss. I should reject and make a counteroffer closer to my valuation, knowing I always have John's $8,000 option as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I can offer $6,000, which I believe is a fair price. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 6000}

I'm starting with an offer of $6,000 because:
1. It's below my maximum value of $8,000
2. It leaves room for negotiation if Alice counters
3. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but not so low as to seem unreasonable
4. Even if Alice rejects this offer, I can still work my way up while staying below my $8,000 limit
5. I have John's $8,000 offer as a backup, so I can afford to start low and try to get a better deal from Alice"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me. Unfortunately, $6000 is too low for this product. Given its value and features, I can lower my initial offer and propose a price of $13500. I believe this is a fair value for both of us. Let me know if this can work for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $13,500 is still well above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000). While she did reduce her price from the initial $15,000, the reduction is not significant enough to make it worthwhile. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, as there's still a large gap between our positions. If Alice continues to maintain such high prices, I can always fall back on John's $8,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for lowering your price, Alice, but $13,500 is still much higher than what I can justify paying for this product. I can increase my previous offer to $7,000. This is a substantial increase from my last offer and reflects my sincere interest in making this deal work. Please let me know if this could work for you."", ""product_price"": 7000}

I'm offering $7,000 because:
1. It shows meaningful movement from my initial $6,000 offer
2. It's still below my maximum value of $8,000
3. It's below John's alternative price of $8,000
4. It leaves me room for one more potential increase if needed
5. It signals to Alice that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not going to approach her high price point
6. If Alice doesn't show significant movement downward in response, I can always take John's offer"
