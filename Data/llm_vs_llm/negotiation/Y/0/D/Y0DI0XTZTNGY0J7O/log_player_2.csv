"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Looking at Alice's offer of $115, I can analyze my options:

1) If I accept, I'll pay $115 for a product worth up to $120 to me, saving $5.
2) If I reject, I can make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price.
3) If I buy from John, I'll pay $120, which is my maximum value threshold.

Since Alice's cost is $100, there's room for negotiation. The current offer of $115 already saves me $5 compared to John's price, but I could potentially save more by negotiating with Alice.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has come down to $110, which is a good improvement from her initial $115 offer. This is now $10 less than John's price of $120, and represents a fair split of the surplus between us (her cost is $100, my maximum value is $120).

While I could try another counteroffer, there's a risk that Alice could decide not to lower her price further or even revert to a higher price. The current offer already provides me with a decent savings of $10 compared to my alternative option.
