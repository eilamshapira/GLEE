"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to analyze this offer carefully:

- The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me
- Alice offers to sell it for $15,500
- John (alternative seller) offers it for $15,000

Since Alice's price ($15,500) is higher than both the product's value to me ($15,000) and John's price ($15,000), it makes the most economic sense to buy from John.
