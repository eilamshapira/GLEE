While $10,000 is a good price, there's a chance I could get it for even less. I'm willing to risk a counter-offer to see if Alice is motivated to sell quickly."

Alice is clearly trying to meet me somewhere in the middle. $8200 is a good price and significantly less than John's offer. It's time to accept and secure the deal."
