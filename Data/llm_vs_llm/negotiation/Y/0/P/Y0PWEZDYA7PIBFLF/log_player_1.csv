Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for a price of $12,000."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Okay, Bob's offer of $8,000 is tempting, but since I can sell it to John for the same amount, I should try to get more.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, I was hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to negotiate further.""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:
