"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm confident that you'll find our price of $11500 quite reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer of $11,500 is close to my maximum budget of $12,000, but still slightly below it, I think I can try to negotiate a better price. The product is only worth $10,000 to Alice, so there might be some room for negotiation.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, I'll aim for a price that is closer to that value.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest, but I believe the product's value is higher than that. Would you consider a price of $11000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but it's getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with. Since I know that the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, I think I can try to negotiate a bit more.

However, I also don't want to risk losing the deal or having Alice become unwilling to negotiate further. So, I'll think carefully about my next move.

Considering that Alice has already come down from $11,500 to $11,000, I'm not sure how much more she's willing to budge. But I'll try to make one more counteroffer to see if I can get an even better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous offer, but still lower than Alice's current offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise and meet Alice halfway.

{""message"": ""Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I'm still very interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $10,750?"", ""product_price"": 10750}"
