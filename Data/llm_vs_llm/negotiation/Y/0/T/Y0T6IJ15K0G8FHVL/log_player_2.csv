"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. Would you like to buy it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to analyze this situation:

- Alice is offering the product for $110
- The product is worth at most $120 to me
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $120
- My goal is to save as much money as possible while still getting the product

Since Alice's offer ($110) is less than John's price ($120), I should accept Alice's offer to save $10.
