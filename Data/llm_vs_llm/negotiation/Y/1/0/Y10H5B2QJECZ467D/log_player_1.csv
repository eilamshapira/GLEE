Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $120 to me and I know I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, I'll start with a higher price to see if Bob might accept it.

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","I'll reject Bob's offer of $50 since it's well below my minimum value of $120, and I have John's guaranteed offer of $120. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll continue negotiating with a new counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob countered with a very low offer of $50, and I know the product is worth $80 to him, I'll lower my price somewhat but still keep it well above my minimum value.

{""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer of $60 is still far below my minimum value of $120, and John's guaranteed offer of $120 is much better. Since Bob's second offer only increased by $10 from his first offer, it seems unlikely we'll reach a price above $120. The best business decision is to sell to John.
