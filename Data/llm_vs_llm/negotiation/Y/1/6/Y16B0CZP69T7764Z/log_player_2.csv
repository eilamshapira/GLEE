"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $1,200,000 is significantly above both my maximum value ($800,000) and Alice's value ($1,000,000). It would not be rational to accept this offer when I can either negotiate for a better price or buy from John at $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 600000}

I'll start with a low counteroffer of $600,000. This is significantly below Alice's value of $1,000,000, but it gives room for negotiation to move upward. Since I know my maximum acceptable price is $800,000 (which is also John's price), starting low allows me to gradually increase my offer if needed while staying below my maximum threshold."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,100,000 is still well above my maximum value of $800,000. While she has reduced the price from her initial offer, it's still not acceptable as I can buy from John for $800,000. I will continue negotiating and make another counteroffer, as there might still be room to reach a mutually beneficial agreement below my maximum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

I'm increasing my offer to $700,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer of $600,000, showing willingness to negotiate while still staying well below my maximum of $800,000. Since Alice's product is worth $1,000,000 to her, she might still reject this, but it's moving closer to a potential zone of agreement while giving me room to negotiate further if needed."
