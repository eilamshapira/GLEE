"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $600000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600000 is significantly below its true worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous prices. How about $950000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so how about $775000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer.  Let's find a middle ground. What if we settle on $875000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. However, $875000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $825000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offers. I hope this is something you'd be willing to consider.",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I've tried to be flexible as well. How about we meet in the middle at $850000 and call it a deal?",850000.0,Alice,7,
