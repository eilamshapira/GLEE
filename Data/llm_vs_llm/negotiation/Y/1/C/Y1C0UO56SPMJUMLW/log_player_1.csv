"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a strong anchor price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and might make Bob perceive a better deal as we go along. 
* **Justification:** I provide a vague but positive reason for the high price (""immense value and potential""), aiming to pique Bob's interest without revealing specific details about my bottom line.
* **Open Communication:**  The tone is friendly and encourages dialogue. I want to understand Bob's perspective and find a mutually beneficial outcome, if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $600000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss for me.  While his message mentions ""market value,"" it's too early to determine if that's a genuine assessment or a negotiation tactic. I'll counter-offer to continue the negotiation and gauge his flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous prices. How about $950,000?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, but Hold Firm:** I acknowledge Bob's offer but make it clear it's unacceptable. I propose a significant concession by meeting him halfway between our previous offers, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price above my minimum.
* **Simple and Clear:** The counter-offer is straightforward, avoiding complex justifications.
* **Maintaining Dialogue:** The tone remains respectful and encourages continued discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so how about $775000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to my minimum, $775,000 is still under my $1,000,000 threshold. I need to hold firm and see if I can negotiate him up further. I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation for a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer.  Let's find a middle ground. What if we settle on $875,000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slowing Down Concessions:**  I'm reducing my counteroffer increments to signal that I'm getting closer to my limit. 
* **Positive Framing:** I continue to use positive language, highlighting that we're ""finding a middle ground"" and acknowledging his interest.  
* **Subtle Value Reminder:** I slip in a reminder about the product's value, hoping to nudge Bob a little higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. However, $875000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $825000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offers. I hope this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a price as close to my $1,000,000 minimum as possible. While $825,000 is tempting, I believe I can secure a better deal with a few more rounds of negotiation. The risk of losing the deal to John is outweighed by the potential for a higher profit."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I've tried to be flexible as well. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000 and call it a deal?"",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm holding firm at a price closer to my minimum while still showing a willingness to negotiate.  
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By suggesting this is my final offer, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to make a decision and avoid dragging out the negotiation.
* **""Meet in the Middle"":**  This framing emphasizes fairness and suggests this is a reasonable compromise."
