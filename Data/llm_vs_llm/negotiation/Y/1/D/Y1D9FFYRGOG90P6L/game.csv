"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand budget concerns, I cannot accept $100 as it's below my cost. The product has significant value, and my absolute minimum is $200. This is already a substantial discount from my initial offer. The quality and features of this product justify this price point. Would you be able to meet me at $200?",200.0,Alice,3,
