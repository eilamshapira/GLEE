Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider the price to offer Bob. If I price too high, he might reject my offer, and I'll end up selling to John for $150. If I price too low, I might be leaving money on the table.

Since I know the product is worth at least $150 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price, I should set my offer to Bob somewhat higher to try to maximize my profit while still giving him a reasonable chance to accept.
