"Alice's offer: The product price will be $225. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $225
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering the product for $225
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $100

Since Alice's offer ($225) exceeds both the product's value to me ($100) and John's alternative price ($100), the logical decision is to buy from John.
