Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the quality of your product,  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested in buying, but I'd be happy to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
