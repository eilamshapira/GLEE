"Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $20000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $20000 is much higher than I expected. I'm willing to purchase the product for $8000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but I cannot accept $8000 as it's below my minimum threshold. I understand my initial offer might have been high, so I'm willing to reduce it significantly. Given the product's value, I can offer it to you for $15000, which is a substantial reduction from my initial price. Would this work better for you?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15000 is still too high for me. I can increase my offer to $9000.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate that you've increased your offer, but I need to be transparent with you - I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $10000 for the product. I would prefer to do business with you, so I'm willing to come down significantly from my last offer. I can offer you the product for $12000, which is a very reasonable price considering its value. If we can't reach an agreement above $10000, I'll have to accept John's offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
