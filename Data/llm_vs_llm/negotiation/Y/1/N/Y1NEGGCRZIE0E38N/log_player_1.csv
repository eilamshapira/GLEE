"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $20,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $20000 is much higher than I expected. I'm willing to purchase the product for $8000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offered price of $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Since John is willing to pay $10,000, I cannot accept any offer below that amount. I will make a new counteroffer to Bob in the next round, but at a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but I cannot accept $8,000 as it's below my minimum threshold. I understand my initial offer might have been high, so I'm willing to reduce it significantly. Given the product's value, I can offer it to you for $15,000, which is a substantial reduction from my initial price. Would this work better for you?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15000 is still too high for me. I can increase my offer to $9000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $10,000. While we're getting closer, I'll make one more attempt to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. If we can't reach a price above $10,000, I will have to consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate that you've increased your offer, but I need to be transparent with you - I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $10,000 for the product. I would prefer to do business with you, so I'm willing to come down significantly from my last offer. I can offer you the product for $12,000, which is a very reasonable price considering its value. If we can't reach an agreement above $10,000, I'll have to accept John's offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
