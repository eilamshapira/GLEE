Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob, but I cannot accept $8000 as it's below my minimum threshold.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate that you've increased your offer, but I need to be transparent with you - I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $10000 for the product.

If we can't reach an agreement above $10000, I'll have to accept John's offer.
