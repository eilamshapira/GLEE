Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a reasonable price to offer Bob for the product. Since the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed backup buyer at that price, I should offer Bob a price higher than my reservation value.

Without knowing Bob's valuation, I'll need to balance between setting a price high enough to maximize my profit, but not so high that Bob is likely to reject it. If Bob places a higher value on the product than my reservation price, this creates an opportunity for mutual benefit.

I'll offer a price that gives me a meaningful premium over my guaranteed alternative while still potentially being attractive to Bob.
