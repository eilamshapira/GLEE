"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than my maximum budget of $1,200,000, and it's also more than what the product is worth to Alice ($800,000), I can try to negotiate or reject the offer to see if I can get a better deal. However, buying from John for $1,200,000 is my upper limit, and I'd like to save as much money as possible.

Given that rejecting the offer might lead to a better negotiation or a realization that Alice could sell it to me for less (since $1,000,000 is above her worth of $800,000), and buying from John is my last resort at the maximum price I'm willing to pay, my initial response to Alice's offer would be to reject it, hoping for a better price or to test the waters for negotiation.
