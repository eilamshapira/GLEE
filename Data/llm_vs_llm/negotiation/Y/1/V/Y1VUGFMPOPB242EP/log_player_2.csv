"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer is $1,500,000, which is more than the product is worth to me (maximum $1,000,000) and more than John's price ($1,000,000), I should buy from John.
