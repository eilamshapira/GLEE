"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value and could be a game-changer for you. To start, I'm offering it to you for $25000.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000, considering my budget and the value I perceive the product to have.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're working with a budget. While $10000 is lower than I can accept at this point, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $22000?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $22000 is still above my comfortable price range. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'd like to propose $15000 as a counteroffer.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Okay, Bob, $15000 is getting closer. I'm willing to move a little more, but I can't go that low just yet. Let's try $19000.",19000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for continuing to negotiate, Alice. I'm glad we're getting closer, but $19000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering my budget and the value I think the product can bring, I'd like to counteroffer $17000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I hope it's more in line with what you're looking for.",17000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle. $17000 is tempting. Let's try one last time. My absolute lowest is $18000. If you can do that, we have a deal.",18000.0,Alice,7,
