"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price point that is significantly lower. Given my budget and the market conditions, I'd like to propose $800000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800000 significantly undervalues the product's worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway to demonstrate my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable price. How about $1550000?",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1550000 is still quite high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000 to show good faith in our negotiations.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm committed to reaching a deal. While your offer is still below my initial expectations, I'm willing to consider a price of $1300000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
