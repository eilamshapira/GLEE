"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,500 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($8,000) but lower than what I initially offered, and considering we have multiple rounds to negotiate, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try and get closer to my initial price or even higher.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Considering Bob's offer was $8,500 and my initial offer was $11,000, I'll try to find a middle ground that still favors me but shows I'm willing to negotiate. A reasonable counteroffer would be to slightly reduce my initial price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to a price that I might consider acceptable, but it's still lower than my last counteroffer of $10,000. Since we are only in Round 4 and have 6 more rounds to negotiate, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer again and try to meet him somewhere in between my last offer and his current offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Given that Bob's last offer was $9,000 and my previous offer was $10,000, I'll try to find a compromise. A reasonable step would be to reduce my offer slightly, aiming for a midpoint between $9,000 and $10,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer of $9,200 is closer to my last counteroffer of $9,500, indicating he's willing to move upwards. Considering we're halfway through the negotiation rounds, I'll assess the situation: Bob's offer is still below my desired price, but it's getting closer. Since $9,200 is higher than my minimum acceptable price and we have 4 more rounds to negotiate, I might consider accepting this offer or making a small adjustment to my previous counteroffer to see if Bob will meet me at a slightly higher price.

However, given the context, accepting $9,200 might be a reasonable decision since it's a significant amount and higher than my minimum, but I'll try one more time to see if I can get a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Given that Bob's last offer was $9,200 and my previous offer was $9,500, I'll make a small concession to try and finalize the deal. I'll reduce my offer by a small amount to signal that I'm willing to compromise but still aim to get as close as possible to my desired price.
