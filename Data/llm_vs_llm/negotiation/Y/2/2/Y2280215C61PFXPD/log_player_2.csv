"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $11,000 is close to my maximum budget of $12,000, but I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll choose to reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try and negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's initial offer was $11,000 and I want to save as much money as possible, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower, but still reasonable, to give room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly above that value.

{""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $10,000 is more reasonable, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since I know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, I'm willing to continue negotiating to try and get closer to that price. I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","In Round 2, I offered $8,500, which was rejected by Alice. Now, Alice has come down to $10,000. To try and meet in the middle and also considering the product's value to Alice, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one but still lower than Alice's current offer.

{""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $9,500 is getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, but I still think I can negotiate a bit more. Since we're halfway through the rounds and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy from Alice, I'll consider making a more serious counteroffer. However, given the current offer is just $500 away from my maximum budget of $10,000 (considering I initially aimed to save as much as possible from the $12,000 maximum), I might need to decide whether to accept this offer or try to squeeze out a slightly better deal.

For now, I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further, aiming to get as close as possible to $9,000, which seems like a more reasonable midpoint between Alice's valuation and my budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice's last offer was $9,500 and I'm trying to get closer to $9,000, I'll make a counteroffer that splits the difference between my previous offer of $9,000 and Alice's current offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still trying to save as much money as possible.

{""product_price"": 9200}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $9,300 is very close to my target price range, and considering we're running out of rounds, I need to weigh the benefits of continuing to negotiate against the risk of losing the deal. Given that Alice has consistently come down in price and we're now only $300 apart from my previous target of $9,000, it seems like we're very close to a mutually agreeable price.

At this point, continuing to negotiate might not yield significant enough savings to justify the risk of Alice not accepting another counteroffer. Therefore, I'm inclined to accept Alice's current offer of $9,300, as it represents a good compromise and is well below my maximum budget of $12,000.
