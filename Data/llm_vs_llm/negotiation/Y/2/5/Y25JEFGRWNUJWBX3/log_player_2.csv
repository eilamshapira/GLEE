"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer is significantly higher than my maximum value of $12,000, and also higher than John's price. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better deal from Alice, knowing I always have John's $12,000 offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 8000}

I'll start with a relatively low offer of $8,000. This gives room for negotiation while still being a reasonable price. Since I know the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and John offers it at $12,000, I want to try to get a better deal from Alice. Starting at $8,000 leaves room for back-and-forth negotiation while potentially saving me money compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has lowered her price from $19,000 to $15,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but $15,000 is still higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000). I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round, as there's still potential to get a better deal from Alice than John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 10000}

I'll increase my offer to $10,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer of $8,000, showing I'm willing to negotiate in good faith. It's still below both my maximum value and John's price of $12,000, giving me room to potentially save money while also leaving space for further negotiation if needed. Since Alice has shown willingness to reduce her price significantly (from $19,000 to $15,000), there's a chance she might accept this more reasonable offer or at least continue negotiating towards a mutually acceptable price."
