"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","I'll reject Bob's offer of $70 since it's below my minimum acceptable price ($80) and even below John's guaranteed offer. I can either make a counteroffer or sell to John, but since I still have several rounds left for negotiation, I'll try another offer with Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price a bit from my initial offer but still keep it above my minimum threshold.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer of $75 is still below both my minimum acceptable price and John's guaranteed offer of $80. Since I can always sell to John for $80, there's no reason to accept anything lower than that. Rather than continue negotiating with Bob who seems unwilling to meet my minimum price, I'll take the guaranteed $80 from John.
