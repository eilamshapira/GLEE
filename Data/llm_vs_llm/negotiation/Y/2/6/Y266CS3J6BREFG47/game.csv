,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $25000 is well above what I'm willing to pay for this product. I know the market value of similar products, and I actually have another seller (John) who's offering the same product for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer you $8000 for the product, which I believe is reasonable considering the market alternatives.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, and I understand you're looking for a fair price. However, I can't go that low. Considering the unique aspects of this product, I'm willing to come down a bit, but my bottom line is higher. How about:",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit in price, but $22000 is still much higher than what I can justify paying. The product is worth no more than $10000 to me, and as I mentioned, I have another seller offering it at exactly that price. If you'd like to continue our negotiation, I can increase my offer to $9000, which is almost what I'd pay elsewhere, but I'd prefer working with you if possible. However, if we can't get closer on price, I'll need to go with my alternative option.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have another offer for $10000. While I'm sure the product is worth more, I value your business. I'm willing to meet you closer to that, but I need to make a reasonable profit. My final offer is:",18000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still much higher than what makes financial sense for me. As I've mentioned, the product is worth no more than $10000 to me, which happens to be exactly what John is offering. In the interest of doing business with you instead, I can offer $9500 - which is extremely close to my alternative option. I hope we can reach an agreement, but I simply cannot justify paying more than what the product is worth to me.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate the back-and-forth. However, given your alternative offer and the value I place on the product, my absolute final offer is:",16000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation and bringing your price down to $16000. However, I need to be completely transparent - the product has a maximum value of $10000 to me, and I already have an offer at exactly that price from another seller. I would like to do business with you, but I cannot justify paying more than the product's value to me. My final offer is $10000, matching what I would pay elsewhere. If we can't agree at this price point, I'll unfortunately need to pursue the alternative option.",10000.0,Bob,8,
