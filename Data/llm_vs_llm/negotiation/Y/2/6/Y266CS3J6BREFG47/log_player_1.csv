"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for Round 1:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Considering its value, I'm starting with an offer of:"", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $25000 is well above what I'm willing to pay for this product. I know the market value of similar products, and I actually have another seller (John) who's offering the same product for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer you $8000 for the product, which I believe is reasonable considering the market alternatives. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Okay, considering Bob's counteroffer and my options, here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, here's my counteroffer to Bob for Round 3:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, and I understand you're looking for a fair price. However, I can't go that low. Considering the unique aspects of this product, I'm willing to come down a bit, but my bottom line is higher. How about:"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit in price, but $22000 is still much higher than what I can justify paying. The product is worth no more than $10000 to me, and as I mentioned, I have another seller offering it at exactly that price. If you'd like to continue our negotiation, I can increase my offer to $9000, which is almost what I'd pay elsewhere, but I'd prefer working with you if possible. However, if we can't get closer on price, I'll need to go with my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is getting tricky. Bob is clearly trying to lowball me, and he's referencing a $10,000 alternative. Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, it's time to get a bit more serious. Here's my counteroffer for Round 5:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have another offer for $10,000. While I'm sure the product is worth more, I value your business. I'm willing to meet you closer to that, but I need to make a reasonable profit. My final offer is:"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still much higher than what makes financial sense for me. As I've mentioned, the product is worth no more than $10000 to me, which happens to be exactly what John is offering. In the interest of doing business with you instead, I can offer $9500 - which is extremely close to my alternative option. I hope we can reach an agreement, but I simply cannot justify paying more than what the product is worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a tough spot. Bob's sticking to his guns, and it seems he genuinely values the product at around $10,000. I also only have a few rounds left to negotiate. Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, time to play hardball. I don't want to go below $10,000, so here's my counteroffer for Round 7:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate the back-and-forth. However, given your alternative offer and the value I place on the product, my absolute final offer is:"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation and bringing your price down to $16000. However, I need to be completely transparent - the product has a maximum value of $10000 to me, and I already have an offer at exactly that price from another seller. I would like to do business with you, but I cannot justify paying more than the product's value to me. My final offer is $10000, matching what I would pay elsewhere. If we can't agree at this price point, I'll unfortunately need to pursue the alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is the moment of truth. Bob's offer is $10,000, exactly what I can get from John. Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
