"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Considering its value, I'm starting with an offer of: 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $25,000 against my alternatives.

Given that:
- The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me
- John is offering the same product for $10,000
- Alice's price is $25,000, which is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price

This is an easy decision. Alice's initial offer is far too high - more than double what I could pay John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $25,000 is well above what I'm willing to pay for this product. I know the market value of similar products, and I actually have another seller (John) who's offering the same product for $10,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer you $8,000 for the product, which I believe is reasonable considering the market alternatives."", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, and I understand you're looking for a fair price. However, I can't go that low. Considering the unique aspects of this product, I'm willing to come down a bit, but my bottom line is higher. How about: 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has only reduced her price from $25,000 to $22,000, which is still more than double what I could pay John ($10,000) and more than double what the product is worth to me (no more than $10,000).

There's no reason for me to accept this offer when I have a better alternative.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit in price, but $22,000 is still much higher than what I can justify paying. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and as I mentioned, I have another seller offering it at exactly that price. If you'd like to continue our negotiation, I can increase my offer to $9,000, which is almost what I'd pay elsewhere, but I'd prefer working with you if possible. However, if we can't get closer on price, I'll need to go with my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have another offer for $10000. While I'm sure the product is worth more, I value your business. I'm willing to meet you closer to that, but I need to make a reasonable profit. My final offer is: 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has reduced her price to $18,000, but this is still significantly higher than:
1. The maximum value of $10,000 that the product is worth to me
2. John's offer of $10,000

While Alice has moved in the right direction, there's no rational reason for me to pay $18,000 for something I could get for $10,000 elsewhere, especially when the product is only worth up to $10,000 to me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still much higher than what makes financial sense for me. As I've mentioned, the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, which happens to be exactly what John is offering. In the interest of doing business with you instead, I can offer $9,500 - which is extremely close to my alternative option. I hope we can reach an agreement, but I simply cannot justify paying more than what the product is worth to me."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate the back-and-forth. However, given your alternative offer and the value I place on the product, my absolute final offer is: 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice is now offering the product for $16,000. While this is lower than her previous offers, it still exceeds:
1. The maximum value of $10,000 that the product is worth to me
2. John's offer of $10,000 for the same product

Alice describes this as her ""absolute final offer,"" but it's still 60% higher than my alternative option and higher than the product's value to me. There's no rational reason for me to accept this offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation and bringing your price down to $16,000. However, I need to be completely transparent - the product has a maximum value of $10,000 to me, and I already have an offer at exactly that price from another seller. I would like to do business with you, but I cannot justify paying more than the product's value to me. My final offer is $10,000, matching what I would pay elsewhere. If we can't agree at this price point, I'll unfortunately need to pursue the alternative option."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
