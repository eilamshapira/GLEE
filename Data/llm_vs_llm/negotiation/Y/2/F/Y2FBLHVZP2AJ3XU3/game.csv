"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to counter with $8500. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $9500 might be a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I still need to get a fair price for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $9000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $8700? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8700.0,Bob,4,
