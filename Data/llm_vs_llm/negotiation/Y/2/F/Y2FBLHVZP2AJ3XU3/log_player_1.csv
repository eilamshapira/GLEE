Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to counter with $8500. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's counteroffer of $8,500 is very close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($8,000), and selling to John would only get me $8,000, I think I can try to negotiate a bit more with Bob to see if I can get a better price.
