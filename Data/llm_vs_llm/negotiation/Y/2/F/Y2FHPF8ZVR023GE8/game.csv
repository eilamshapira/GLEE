,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer, but $25000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. However, $8000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway though. How about $18000? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my interest in doing business with you.",18000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a middle ground. I can offer the product for $15000. This price is fair and reflects the value of the product. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price Alice.  I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground, but $15000 is still too high for me.  How about we split the difference closer to my last offer, would $10000 work for you?",10000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10000 is the minimum I can accept from another buyer, and I need to consider that option. Let's try to find a better deal. How about $13000? This is a fair compromise and still below my initial offer.",13000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer, but I need to make a bit more room for negotiation. How about we settle at $12000? This is a good price that reflects the value of the product and shows my willingness to work with you.",12000.0,Alice,5,
