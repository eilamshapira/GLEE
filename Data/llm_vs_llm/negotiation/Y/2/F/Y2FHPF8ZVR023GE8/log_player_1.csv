Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer, but $25000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8000. What do you think?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a middle ground. I can offer the product for $15,000. This price is fair and reflects the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price Alice.  I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground, but $15000 is still too high for me.  How about we split the difference closer to my last offer, would $10000 work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

However, $10,000 is the minimum I can accept from another buyer, and I need to consider that option. Let's try to find a better deal. How about $13,000? This is a fair compromise and still below my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 13000}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer, but I need to make a bit more room for negotiation. How about we settle at $12,000? This is a good price that reflects the value of the product and shows my willingness to work with you."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
