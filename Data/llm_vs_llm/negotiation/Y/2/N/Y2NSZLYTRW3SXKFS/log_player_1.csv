Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 250}
```

My reasoning is as follows:

*   **Starting High:** I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and potentially capture a higher price if the product is valuable to him. $250 is a significant markup, but not so outrageous that it will immediately scare him away. It leaves room for negotiation.
*   **Flexibility:** I have a floor of $150 in mind. I can adjust the price downward in subsequent rounds if necessary, but it's always better to start high and negotiate down than to start low and have no room to move.
*   **Knowing My Bottom Line:** I am prepared to walk away if Bob's offers are too low because I have John waiting with $150. This gives me confidence in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Okay, this is where the negotiation begins. Bob's offer of $100 is unacceptable. My bottom line is $150, and I can get that from John right now.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I will prepare a counteroffer for the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob, considering his low initial bid:

```json
{""product_price"": 225}
```

Reasoning:

*   **Still Anchoring High:** Bob's $100 offer is quite low. I need to bring the price up significantly.
*   **Gradual Decrease:** Dropping from $250 directly to $150 would seem too drastic and signal desperation. A more gradual decrease might be perceived as more reasonable.
*   **Testing the Waters:** $225 allows me to see how serious Bob is. If he comes up significantly from $100, it suggests the product might have real value to him. If he barely moves, I know he's just looking for a bargain.
*   **Protecting My Option:** I keep John's $150 offer in mind. I won't go below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob is clearly trying to lowball me. His offer of $110 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.

```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $150 from John. Continuing to negotiate with Bob would likely be a waste of time."
