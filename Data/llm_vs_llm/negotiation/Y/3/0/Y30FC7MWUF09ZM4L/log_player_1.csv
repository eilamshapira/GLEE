Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to think about the optimal price to offer Bob. Since the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, that's the maximum he would be willing to pay. Since I have an alternative buyer (John) who will pay $10,000, I don't need to offer any discount to Bob.

If I offer the product at exactly $10,000, Bob should be indifferent between accepting and rejecting (as the product's value to him equals the price). However, in practice, people often need some small incentive to act.

Given these considerations, I'll offer the product at $10,000, which maximizes my revenue while still being acceptable to Bob based on his valuation.
