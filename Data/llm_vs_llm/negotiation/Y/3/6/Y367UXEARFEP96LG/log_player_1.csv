"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its features and value, I'm offering it for $250. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $250 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $120.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll counter with a new offer since $120 is below my minimum acceptable price ($150), but I want to try negotiating with Bob before selling to John.

{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand $250 might be high, but $120 is too low for the quality of this product. I can offer it to you for $200. This is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand $250 might be high, but $120 is too low for the quality of this product. I can offer it to you for $200. This is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $200 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $160.  Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $160. This is a better deal than selling to John for $150, and it's a reasonable compromise from both our initial positions."
