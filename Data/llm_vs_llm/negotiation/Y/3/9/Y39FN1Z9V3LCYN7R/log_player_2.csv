"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $25000. This product is highly valuable, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you. If you're interested, please let me know! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Looking at the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $25,000
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $12,000

Since Alice's price ($25,000) is significantly higher than both the product's value to me and John's alternative offer, the best decision is to buy from John.
