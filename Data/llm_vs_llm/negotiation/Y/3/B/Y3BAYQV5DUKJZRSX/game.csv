"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I believe $1500000 is on the higher end for this item. I know John is offering it at that price, but I was hoping to find a better deal. Would you consider $1100000 for the product? This would make it much more attractive for me to purchase from you rather than your competitor.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob! I appreciate your offer of $1100000. However, I believe the value of the product justifies a higher price. I would be willing to accept $1350000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's exclusive nature. Let me know your thoughts!",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on your price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $1350000 is certainly better than John's price, but I'm still hoping we can find more middle ground. Would you consider $1225000? This would be a win-win for both of us - you make the sale at a good price point, and I get a better deal than I would elsewhere.",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob! Thank you for your counteroffer of $1225000. I see we are getting closer! However, I still believe the product is worth more. I'm willing to adjust my offer to $1300000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still providing you with a great deal compared to John's offer. Let me know what you think!",1300000.0,Alice,5,
