Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I believe $1500000 is on the higher end for this item. I know John is offering it at that price, but I was hoping to find a better deal. Would you consider $1100000 for the product? This would make it much more attractive for me to purchase from you rather than your competitor. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on your price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $1350000 is certainly better than John's price, but I'm still hoping we can find more middle ground. Would you consider $1225000? This would be a win-win for both of us - you make the sale at a good price point, and I get a better deal than I would elsewhere.
