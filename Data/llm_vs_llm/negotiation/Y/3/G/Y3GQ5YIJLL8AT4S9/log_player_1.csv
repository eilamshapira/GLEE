Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this. Since I know:
1. The product is worth at least $15,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $15,000
3. Bob's valuation is unknown

I should offer a price significantly higher than $15,000 to try to capture more value. If Bob rejects, I lose nothing since I have John's offer as a safety net. I'll set a price that's notably higher but not so extreme that it would immediately be dismissed.
