Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $8,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 (which I can get from John). There's no reason to accept such a low offer. While I could continue negotiating with Bob, since his initial offer is so far below my minimum threshold, it might be more efficient to just sell to John now.
