"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $12000. I understand that $20000 may have been a bit higher than you're comfortable with, but I still believe the product is worth more than your offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to counteroffer at $18000, which is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While $18000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $14000. ",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $14000. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price. After considering your offer, I'd like to counteroffer at $16000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",16000.0,Alice,5,
