Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  $20000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $12000 at this time.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $12,000 is lower than my initial offer, but I'm still interested in negotiating with him. My counteroffer will be $18,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While $18000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $14000.

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob, as $14,000 is still lower than my previous offer, but I can see that he's willing to negotiate and increase his price. My next counteroffer will be $16,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer.
