"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","A $1,000,000 offer from Bob is quite good - it's significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk of losing this good offer, and it's already providing a substantial profit. I'll accept this offer.
