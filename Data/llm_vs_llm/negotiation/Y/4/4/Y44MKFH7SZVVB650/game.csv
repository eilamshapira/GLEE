"Alice, that's a very high price. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 for it. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market rate.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $17000.  This gives you a good deal and allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $17000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12500. This price is fair and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $12500 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $14750?  That's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",14750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14750 is still too high for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to pay $13500. This price is reasonable and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",13500.0,Bob,6,
