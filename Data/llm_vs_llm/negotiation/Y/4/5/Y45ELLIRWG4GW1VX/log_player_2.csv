"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to consider the values here:
- The product is worth up to $12,000 to me (Bob)
- Alice is offering it for $11,999
- John is offering it for $12,000

Alice's offer is $1 cheaper than John's offer. While the savings is minimal, it's still better financially to accept Alice's offer rather than pay more to John.
