"Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for sale. I think it's fantastic and worth a lot, but I'm willing to part with it for $200. What do you say?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $120. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob! While I appreciate the offer, $120 is considerably lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $170? I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $170 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $145. This is closer to my budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",145.0,Bob,4,
