"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for sale. I think it's fantastic and worth a lot, but I'm willing to part with it for $200. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer of $200 is above my budget of $150, I will reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is reasonable and within my budget. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a lower offer.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $120. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob! While I appreciate the offer, $120 is considerably lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $170? I believe that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's new offer of $170 is still above my budget of $150. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $150, I don't see a reason to accept Alice's offer. I'll reject it again and try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to meet Alice halfway between her previous offer and my previous counteroffer. Since Alice offered $170 and I previously offered $120, I'll split the difference and offer $145.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $170 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $145. This is closer to my budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 145}"
