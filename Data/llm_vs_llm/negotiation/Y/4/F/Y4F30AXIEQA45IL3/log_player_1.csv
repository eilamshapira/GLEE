Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $20000 is more than I can justify spending. I have another seller offering the same product for $15000, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $12000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $12,000 is the minimum value I have for the product, and selling it to John would also be for $12,000, I don't see a benefit in selling to John over accepting Bob's offer directly. However, I would like to try to negotiate a better price with Bob if possible. Given that Bob has already mentioned another seller offering the product for $15,000, and he prefers to do business with me, there might be some room for negotiation. But, considering Bob's offer is already at my minimum acceptable price, the risk of losing the sale if I counteroffer is significant.
