"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $20,000, I need to evaluate if this is a good deal for me. Since the product is only worth $15,000 to me, paying $20,000 would mean losing $5,000 in value. Additionally, I have the option to buy the same product from John for exactly $15,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

Alice's initial offer is above my maximum valuation, so it doesn't make sense to accept it. I should either make a counteroffer to try to get a better price from Alice or go with John's guaranteed option.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $20,000 is more than I can justify spending. I have another seller offering the same product for $15,000, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
