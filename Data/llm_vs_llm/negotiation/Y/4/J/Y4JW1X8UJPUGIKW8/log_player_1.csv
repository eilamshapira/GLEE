Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's quite a bit higher than I was looking to spend. I'm willing to pay $400000 for the product. If that works for you let me know. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I would like to sell the product for more! I am willing to let Bob buy the product for less, but not for as little as 400000!"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand that the initial price might be a bit high for you, but I believe the value of the product is worth more than your offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but that's still a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'll increase my offer to $500000. How does that sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000

I don't think Bob is willing to pay a reasonable price for the product. It's better to sell it to John for $1,000,000 instead of accepting Bob's offer of $500,000."
