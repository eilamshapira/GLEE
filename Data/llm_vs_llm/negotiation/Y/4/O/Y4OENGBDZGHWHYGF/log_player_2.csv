"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Here's my reasoning:

*   **Alice's offer:** $900,000.
*   **My value:** Up to $1,000,000.
*   **Alice's cost:** $800,000.
*   **John's offer:** $1,000,000.

Buying from Alice at $900,000 is better than buying from John at $1,000,000. Therefore, I should accept the offer.
