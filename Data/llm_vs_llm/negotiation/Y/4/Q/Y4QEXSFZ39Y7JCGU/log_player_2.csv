"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given the information, Alice is offering the product for $15,000, but it's only worth a maximum of $10,000 to me. John is offering the same product for $10,000, which is equal to the maximum value I place on it.

Alice's offer is $5,000 more than what the product is worth to me, and also $5,000 more than John's offer. There's no reason for me to accept this deal or make a counteroffer when I can get the same product at my maximum valuation from John.
