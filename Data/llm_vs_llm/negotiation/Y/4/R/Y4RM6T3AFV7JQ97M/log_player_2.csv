"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer ($1,500,000) is higher than both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000), the rational decision would be to buy from John. This way, I can get the product while saving $500,000 compared to Alice's offer.
