Send your offer to Bob.,"Based on the situation, I need to determine a strategic price for Bob.

I know that my product is worth at least $120 to me, which is guaranteed because John will pay $120 if Bob rejects my offer.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I need to balance between:
1) Setting a higher price to maximize my profit
2) Not setting it so high that Bob will definitely reject it

A reasonable approach is to set a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($120), giving me room for substantial profit while still potentially being acceptable to Bob.
