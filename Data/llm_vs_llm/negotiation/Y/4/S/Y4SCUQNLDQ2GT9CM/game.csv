"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think!",119.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product for $119, but that's very close to what I can get elsewhere. Given that this product is worth around $100 to you, I think a fairer price would be $110, which still gives you a good profit while offering me a better deal. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your point, but I still believe the product is worth more than $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial price.",114.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for moving on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $114.50 is better, I think we can find an even more mutually beneficial agreement. How about we meet in the middle again at $107.25? This still gives you a nice profit over your cost while providing me with meaningful savings compared to my other options.",107.25,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're a skilled negotiator. I appreciate your persistence, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Meeting in the middle again would put the price at $111.25, which is more in line with what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to feel confident that I'm getting a good deal.",111.25,Alice,5,
