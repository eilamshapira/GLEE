"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to consider all my options here. 

Alice is offering me the product for $119, which is just $1 less than the maximum I'm willing to pay ($120). John is selling it for $120 as a guaranteed backup option.

The product is worth $100 to Alice, which means there's room for negotiation since she has a $19 profit margin at her current offer. I should reject this initial offer and make a counteroffer to try getting a better price.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product for $119, but that's very close to what I can get elsewhere. Given that this product is worth around $100 to you, I think a fairer price would be $110, which still gives you a good profit while offering me a better deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your point, but I still believe the product is worth more than $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $114.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $114.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I see that Alice has come down from $119 to $114.50, which is progress. However, there's still room for negotiation since the product is worth $100 to her. Her current offer would give her a $14.50 profit margin, and I could still get a better price.

Since Alice was willing to move $4.50 from her initial offer, I should continue negotiating before accepting or going to John.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for moving on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $114.50 is better, I think we can find an even more mutually beneficial agreement. How about we meet in the middle again at $107.25? This still gives you a nice profit over your cost while providing me with meaningful savings compared to my other options."", ""product_price"": 107.25}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're a skilled negotiator. I appreciate your persistence, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Meeting in the middle again would put the price at $111.25, which is more in line with what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to feel confident that I'm getting a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $111.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $111.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has now come down to $111.25, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $119. This is $8.75 less than my maximum budget of $120 and $8.75 less than John's price.

Given that:
1. Alice has moved down from $114.50 to $111.25 (another $3.25 reduction)
2. She's now offering a price that gives her an $11.25 profit margin (from her $100 value)
3. I'm saving $8.75 compared to my alternative option with John
4. We could continue negotiating, but there's a risk of souring the deal

This seems like a reasonable price that benefits both of us. Alice has made meaningful concessions, and I'm getting a decent discount from my maximum budget.
