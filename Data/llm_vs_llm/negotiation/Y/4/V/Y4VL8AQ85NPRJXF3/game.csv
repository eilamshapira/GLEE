"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I agree that it's a great opportunity for both of us. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. I'd like to propose a price that I believe is more in line with the product's value.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a lower price point, but I'm afraid $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Considering the product's value and our previous discussions, I'd like to propose a price of $13500. I believe this price reflects the product's worth and is a fair compromise.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. However, I still think $13500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value and our previous discussions, I'd like to propose a price of $11500. I believe this price is a fair compromise and reflects the product's worth.",11500.0,Bob,4,
