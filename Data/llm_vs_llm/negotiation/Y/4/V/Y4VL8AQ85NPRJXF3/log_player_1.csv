Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I agree that it's a great opportunity for both of us. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. I'd like to propose a price that I believe is more in line with the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $10,000 because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'd like to proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually beneficial price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a lower price point, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Considering the product's value and our previous discussions, I'd like to propose a price of $13,500. I believe this price reflects the product's worth and is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 13500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. However, I still think $13500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value and our previous discussions, I'd like to propose a price of $11500. I believe this price is a fair compromise and reflects the product's worth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $11,500 because, although it's getting closer to my target, I still believe I can get a better price. Since Bob's offer is still below the price I'm willing to accept, and it's also below the price John is offering ($12,000), I'd like to proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually beneficial price that is higher than $12,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm glad to see that we're getting closer to a mutually acceptable price. Considering your latest offer of $11,500, I'd like to propose a price of $13,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your latest proposal."", ""product_price"": 13000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable price. I'm glad to see that we're making progress. Considering your latest offer of $13000, I'd like to propose a price of $12000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value, and I'm hoping we can meet at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

I accept Bob's offer of $12,000. Since this is the minimum price I was willing to accept, and it matches the offer from John, I don't see a need to continue negotiating. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal immediately, and I won't risk losing the sale if I were to reject it and try to negotiate further."
