"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $12,000
2. John's price is also $12,000
3. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
4. Both offers are at my maximum valuation

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($12,000), and this is at my maximum valuation, I can accept either offer. However, since Alice made the offer first, I might as well accept her offer as there's no financial advantage in rejecting it to buy from John.
