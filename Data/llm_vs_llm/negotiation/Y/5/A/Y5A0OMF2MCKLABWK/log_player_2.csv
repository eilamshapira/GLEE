"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer is $100, which is the same price as John's, and it's the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, there's no advantage in accepting Alice's offer immediately. I should try to negotiate for a better price by rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer. If negotiations fail, I can always fall back to either Alice's or John's $100 price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low that it would be considered unreasonable.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has significantly reduced the price from $100 to $75, which is a good offer considering my maximum value is $100 and John's fixed price is $100. While I could try to negotiate further, $75 is already a 25% savings from my maximum price, and there's a risk that Alice might increase the price if I continue negotiating. I'll accept this offer.
