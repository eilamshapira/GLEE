"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, Bob, I'm excited to be offering you this incredible product! Given its value to you, I think a fair starting point would be:

{""message"": ""Bob, considering the unique value this product brings to you, I'm offering it to you for a price of:"", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I see the value, but I need a lower price to make this work. How about we settle around... 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $1,000,000, I need to consider my options carefully. While $1,000,000 is more than my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I also need to leave room for further negotiation.

Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counter_offer"": 1300000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down, but I still believe the product's value to you is significant. How about this:

{""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob. However, considering the value this product offers you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is:"", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be frank, I have a budget in mind, and I need to stay closer to it.  Would you be willing to consider... 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob is still pushing for a lower price, but his offer is getting closer to a reasonable figure. I'm still confident I can get a bit more, but I need to be mindful of the remaining rounds. The risk of losing the deal altogether is increasing.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer, but I'll be more flexible this time.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counter_offer"": 1200000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, Bob, I see you're serious about getting a good deal. I'm also eager to finalize this, so I'll make a final adjustment:

{""message"": ""Alright Bob, I'm willing to be flexible to make this happen. My final offer is:"", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
