"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. It's a great product, and I think it's worth a bit more than $80. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $110 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm happy to go up to $90.  This is a fair price that's a good compromise for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit above $90, but I'm willing to come down to $100. This is the lowest I'm comfortable going, considering the product's value. Let me know if this works for you!",100.0,Alice,5,
