"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that price is much higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm looking to spend no more than $800000. Let's start the negotiation there.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that my initial price was higher than you're willing to pay. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer of $600000, I'd like to make a counteroffer that's more reasonable. I believe the product's value is still much higher, but I'm open to discussion.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your current price is still much higher than I'm looking to spend. I'm going to increase my offer, but it will still be significantly lower than your current asking price.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for increasing your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than your current offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us. Considering your latest offer of $650000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1800000. I'm open to further discussion, but I also have other options to consider.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
