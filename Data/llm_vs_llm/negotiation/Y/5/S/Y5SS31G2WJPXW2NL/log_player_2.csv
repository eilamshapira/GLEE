"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $1,200,000
2. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me (Bob)
3. John's price is also $1,200,000
4. All options lead to the same price: $1,200,000

Since all options result in the same price ($1,200,000), and this price equals both my maximum valuation and Alice's valuation, I can choose any option. There's no financial advantage to choosing one over the others.

I'll accept Alice's offer since it's straightforward and accomplishes the goal directly.
