"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I've found a similar product from another seller for $120, so I'd need a better price to make it worth my while. Would you consider selling it for $80? This would be a win for both of us - I'd save some money and you'd make a sale today.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While I understand you're looking for a better price, I should mention that my product is of premium quality. Since you mentioned finding a similar product for $120, I can offer you this one for $110, which gives you a good discount while ensuring you get a quality product. How does that sound?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that your product is premium quality. I'm still hoping we can meet a bit closer to the middle though. Would you consider $95? That would be a great deal for me and still a good sale for you, especially compared to me walking away and buying elsewhere.",95.0,Bob,4,
