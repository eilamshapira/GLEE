Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I've found a similar product from another seller for $120, so I'd need a better price to make it worth my while. Would you consider selling it for $80? This would be a win for both of us - I'd save some money and you'd make a sale today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob mentioned he found a similar product for $120, this indicates he values the product at least at that price point. While he's trying to negotiate down to $80, which is my minimum acceptable price, I can likely get a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price between $80 and $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While I understand you're looking for a better price, I should mention that my product is of premium quality. Since you mentioned finding a similar product for $120, I can offer you this one for $110, which gives you a good discount while ensuring you get a quality product. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that your product is premium quality. I'm still hoping we can meet a bit closer to the middle though. Would you consider $95? That would be a great deal for me and still a good sale for you, especially compared to me walking away and buying elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $95 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly better than my alternative of selling to John for $80, and Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate in good faith, moving up from his initial $80 offer. While I might be able to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk of Bob walking away, which would leave me with only the $80 option from John. A guaranteed $95 is a good outcome."
