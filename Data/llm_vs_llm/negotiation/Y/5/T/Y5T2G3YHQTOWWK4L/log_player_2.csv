"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to analyze this situation carefully. 

Alice is offering the product for $120, which is exactly the same price that John is offering and exactly my maximum valuation for the product. Since both options would cost me the same amount ($120), and I wouldn't save any money by buying from John instead of Alice, I should try to negotiate a better price with Alice first.

I should reject Alice's initial offer and make a counteroffer that's lower than $120. This gives me a chance to potentially save some money, while I still have the option to buy from John at $120 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't work out.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I've found a similar product from another seller for $120, so I'd need a better price to make it worth my while. Would you consider selling it for $80? This would be a win for both of us - I'd save some money and you'd make a sale today."", ""product_price"": 80}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While I understand you're looking for a better price, I should mention that my product is of premium quality. Since you mentioned finding a similar product for $120, I can offer you this one for $110, which gives you a good discount while ensuring you get a quality product. How does that sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has countered with $110, which is $10 less than both my maximum valuation and John's price. This is a better deal than buying from John, but I might still be able to negotiate an even better price. Since I have nothing to lose by making another counteroffer (I can always go back to either accepting Alice's $110 offer or buying from John at $120), I'll try to negotiate further.

I'm still hoping we can meet a bit closer to the middle though. Would you consider $95? That would be a great deal for me and still a good sale for you, especially compared to me walking away and buying elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 95}"
