Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my options carefully here. 

If I offer Bob a price that's too high (above $8,000), he'll reject it since the product is only worth $8,000 to him. If he rejects my offer, I can sell to John for $12,000, which is my minimum acceptable value anyway.

Since the product is worth no less than $12,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price (John), there's no reason for me to offer Bob a price below $12,000. Even if I offered exactly $8,000, I'd be getting $4,000 less than what I could get from John.

The rational decision is to offer Bob a price that ensures I get my minimum value:

{""product_price"": 12000}"
