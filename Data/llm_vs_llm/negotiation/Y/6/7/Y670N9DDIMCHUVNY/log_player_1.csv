Send your offer to Bob.,"Based on my understanding of the situation, I need to carefully consider my price. Since the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at exactly that price, there's no incentive for me to sell it to Bob for less than $1,000,000.

Although the product is only worth $800,000 to Bob, meaning he would likely reject any offer at or above that amount, I should still make an offer that maximizes my profit.

{""product_price"": 1000000}

My reasoning is simple: If Bob accepts, I get my minimum acceptable value. If Bob rejects (which is likely since my offer exceeds his valuation), I still sell to John for the same amount, so I'm not worse off."
