"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I find the price to be quite steep. I am looking to purchase the product at a more competitive rate. I am willing to offer $600000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $600000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand you're looking for a competitive rate, but I need to consider my bottom line as well. I can come down to $1700000, which represents a $300000 reduction from my initial offer. This product has substantial market value, and I believe this is a fair compromise. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price, $1700000 is still much higher than what I am looking to spend. I value the product at $800000 or less. Considering this, I am willing to increase my offer to $650000.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer, but $650000 is still far below the product's actual value. I appreciate your candor about how you value the product, but I need to be transparent that my absolute minimum price is $1500000, as I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay that amount. I was hoping we could find a mutually beneficial arrangement, but I need to ensure I'm making a sound business decision. Is there any way you could reconsider your budget? I'm willing to offer you $1550000, which is very close to my minimum acceptable price.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
