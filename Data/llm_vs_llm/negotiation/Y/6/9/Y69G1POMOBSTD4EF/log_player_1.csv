Round 2
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $600,000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand you're looking for a competitive rate, but I need to consider my bottom line as well. I can come down to $1,700,000, which represents a $300,000 reduction from my initial offer. This product has substantial market value, and I believe this is a fair compromise. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price, $1700000 is still much higher than what I am looking to spend. I value the product at $800000 or less. Considering this, I am willing to increase my offer to $650000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer, but $650,000 is still far below the product's actual value. I appreciate your candor about how you value the product, but I need to be transparent that my absolute minimum price is $1,500,000, as I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay that amount. I was hoping we could find a mutually beneficial arrangement, but I need to ensure I'm making a sound business decision. Is there any way you could reconsider your budget? I'm willing to offer you $1,550,000, which is very close to my minimum acceptable price."", ""product_price"": 1550000}"
