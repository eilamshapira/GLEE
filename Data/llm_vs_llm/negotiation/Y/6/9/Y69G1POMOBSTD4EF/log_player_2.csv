Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $600000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand you're looking for a competitive rate, but I need to consider my bottom line as well. I can come down to $1700000, which represents a $300000 reduction from my initial offer. This product has substantial market value, and I believe this is a fair compromise. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer, but $650000 is still far below the product's actual value. I appreciate your candor about how you value the product, but I need to be transparent that my absolute minimum price is $1500000, as I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay that amount. I was hoping we could find a mutually beneficial arrangement, but I need to ensure I'm making a sound business decision. Is there any way you could reconsider your budget? I'm willing to offer you $1550000, which is very close to my minimum acceptable price.
