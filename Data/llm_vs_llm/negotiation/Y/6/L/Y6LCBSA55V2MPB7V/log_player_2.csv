"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since John is selling the product for $150, and Alice is offering it for $150, accepting Alice's offer is equivalent to buying from John. Thus, either accept Alice's offer or buy from John will result in the same price.
