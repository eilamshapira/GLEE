"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'm in a strong position here since I have an outside option with John willing to pay $10,000, which is my minimum acceptable value. Since the product is only worth $8,000 to Bob, I should be careful not to price it too high initially.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I see that Bob has increased his offer to $8,200, which is above his valuation of $8,000. This suggests he might be willing to go higher, but I also need to be mindful that we're halfway through our negotiation rounds. I'll make a more substantial concession while still maintaining a good profit margin.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I notice Bob has actually decreased his offer from $8,200 to $8,100, which suggests he's not planning to increase much further. Since we only have a few rounds left and I have the guaranteed option of selling to John for $10,000, I'll make one final reasonable attempt with Bob before likely taking John's offer.
