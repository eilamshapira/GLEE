"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a fantastic product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for just $150. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer is the same as John's price, there's no benefit to rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John. However, I can try to negotiate with Alice by rejecting her offer.
