"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer ($180) is higher than both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120), it would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. I can get the same product from John for $120, which matches my maximum value.
