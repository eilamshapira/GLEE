"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision about buying the product.

The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me (Bob).
Alice is offering to sell it for $18,000.
John is offering to sell the same product for $10,000.

Since Alice's offer ($18,000) exceeds both the product's value to me and John's alternative price, the economically rational choice is to buy from John.
