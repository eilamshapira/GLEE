"Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product.  I'm confident you'll recognize its immense value. I'm asking for $2500000.",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I do recognize the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. I'd like to make a counteroffer.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $500000 is significantly below its true worth. This product offers substantial value, and I'm sure you understand that. I'm willing to come down to $2200000.",2200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you believe the product is worth more, Alice. However, my budget is limited. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. Let's discuss a price of $1100000.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing some movement, which is good.  While $1100000 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to consider an offer closer to that.  How about we settle at $1900000? This reflects the product's inherent value while acknowledging your budget constraints.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1900000 is still above my comfort zone. Considering the product's value and my budget, I'd like to propose a price of $1200000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your position.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1550000.  This is a very reasonable price for a product of this caliber.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to split the difference, but $1550000 is still higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm starting to consider other options, such as purchasing from John for $800000. To make a deal with you, I'd need to see a more significant reduction. I'm willing to offer $900000, which is my highest bid so far.",900000.0,Bob,8,
