"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's offer of $120 is higher than the product's worth to me ($80) and also higher than John's offer ($80), it doesn't make sense for me to accept it.

I have two remaining options: I can try to negotiate with Alice by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer, or I can simply buy from John immediately at $80.

Given that John's price equals my maximum value for the product, and there's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower price than $100 (since that's what the product is worth to her), the most rational decision is to buy from John.
