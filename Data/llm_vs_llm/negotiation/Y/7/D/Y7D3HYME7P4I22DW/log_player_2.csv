"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer since $160 is way above my maximum value of $80. It would make more sense to either negotiate for a lower price or buy from John if we can't reach a reasonable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 70}

I'll offer $70, which is slightly below John's price of $80. This gives some room for negotiation while still being a reasonable price considering the product is worth $120 to Alice. If Alice rejects this, I can always fall back on John's offer of $80."
