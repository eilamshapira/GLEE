Hello Bob! I have a great product to offer you today. I believe it would be very valuable for you. I'm willing to sell it for $200. What do you think?,200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice! Thank you for the offer, but $200 is out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can offer $50. Let me know if we can work something out.",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $50 is significantly below the product's value. Given the quality and worth of the product, I cannot go below $150. This is already a considerable reduction from my initial offer. Would you consider this price?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks, Alice, I understand that you are offering a quality product. However, my budget is quite limited. I'm willing to increase my offer to $70. I hope this can be acceptable.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you increasing your offer, Bob, but I need to be transparent - I have another buyer willing to pay $100 for this product. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Would you be able to offer $130? This is still a significant reduction from my previous offers.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I respect your situation and would like to make a fair deal. My budget can stretch up to $80, and thatâ€™s the best I can do. I hope you can accept this offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
