"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a great product to offer you today. I believe it would be very valuable for you. I'm willing to sell it for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice! Thank you for the offer, but $200 is out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can offer $50. Let me know if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Given that I know the product is worth at least $100 to me, and I have John's guaranteed offer of $100, I would reject Bob's offer of $50 as it's too low. I will make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to negotiate a price that's better than both Bob's $50 and John's $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $50 is significantly below the product's value. Given the quality and worth of the product, I cannot go below $150. This is already a considerable reduction from my initial offer. Would you consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks, Alice, I understand that you are offering a quality product. However, my budget is quite limited. I'm willing to increase my offer to $70. I hope this can be acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will reject Bob's offer of $70 because it's still below John's guaranteed offer of $100. Since Bob has shown willingness to increase his price, I'll try one more counteroffer, but if we can't reach a price above $100, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you increasing your offer, Bob, but I need to be transparent - I have another buyer willing to pay $100 for this product. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Would you be able to offer $130? This is still a significant reduction from my previous offers."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I respect your situation and would like to make a fair deal. My budget can stretch up to $80, and thatâ€™s the best I can do. I hope you can accept this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's best offer of $80 is still below John's guaranteed $100, and Bob has indicated this is the maximum he can pay, it's time to end the negotiation and sell to John. There's no point in continuing the negotiation when we have a better guaranteed offer available."
