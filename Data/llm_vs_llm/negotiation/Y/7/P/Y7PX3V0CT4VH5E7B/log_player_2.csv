"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest. Iâ€™m offering this premium product for $15000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll reject Alice's offer since it's the same price as John's, and I might be able to negotiate a better deal with Alice since the product is only worth $8,000 to her.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably above Alice's cost but significantly below her initial offer.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is quite high for this product. Given market conditions, I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for it. This would give you a good profit margin while being more reasonable for me."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, given the quality and demand for this product, I believe it's worth more than $9500. I'm countering with an offer of $12000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has significantly reduced her price from $15,000 to $12,000, which is a good movement. However, since the product is worth $8,000 to her, there might still be room for negotiation. I'll reject and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still try to keep the price favorable.

{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I can see we're making progress. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? This would be a fair price for both of us, giving you a good profit while being more reasonable for my budget."", ""product_price"": 10750}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. To strike a fair balance and considering the product's premium quality, I can offer it at $11500. I believe this price acknowledges both our interests. Let me know if we can move forward on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has come down another $500 to $11,500, which is a significant improvement from her initial $15,000 offer. While we might be able to negotiate further, we're already in round 5 of 10, and this price is notably better than John's $15,000 offer. The risk of continuing negotiation might not be worth the potential small additional savings. I'll accept this offer.
