You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given that my maximum willingness to pay is $120, and John is already offering it at that price, Alice's offer of $300 is much too high. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, as there's potential to get it for less than $120 from Alice.

Since her counteroffer of $250 is still significantly higher than my maximum of $120, and also higher than John's guaranteed price of $120, I should reject this offer and try another counteroffer.
