"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to consider my options carefully here. Alice has offered me the product for $120, which is less than my maximum budget of $150. This is also less than what John is offering ($150). 

My goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible. Alice's current offer would save me $30 compared to buying from John.

I could try to negotiate further by rejecting and making a counteroffer, but there's a risk that negotiations could break down, and I might end up paying more.

Given that $120 is already a good price (below my maximum value and below John's price), the most rational decision is to accept Alice's offer.
