"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know what you think!",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This price still allows for a significant profit for you, and it's a fair compromise. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit short of being comfortable with the price. I'd like to propose a price of $820000. I believe this is a reasonable step towards finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts!",820000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $820000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and I'll come down to $860000.  This is a fair price that gives you a good deal and allows me to make a profit.  What do you say?",860000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating. Splitting the difference is a good idea, but I was thinking of a slightly different midpoint. How about we meet at $840000? I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account both of our interests. Let me know what you think!",840000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's go with $850000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,7,
