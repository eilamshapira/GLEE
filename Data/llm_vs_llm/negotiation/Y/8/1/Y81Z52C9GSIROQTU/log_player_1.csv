I reject Bob's offer of $750,000 because it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. Since Bob is increasing his offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'd like to proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer to Bob, hoping we can meet at a mutually beneficial price."

I accept Bob's offer of $800,000. Since this is the minimum price I was willing to accept, and Bob has finally met it, I see no need to continue negotiating or consider selling to John for the same price. Accepting Bob's offer allows us to finalize the deal and move forward."
