"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to buy it for $120, considering I can get a similar product from another seller for $150. Let me know if this is something you'd be open to.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must say that $120 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go, considering the product's value. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your offer, but a bit closer to the actual value. I can offer it to you for $160. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $160 is still a bit above my budget. Considering I can get the product from another seller for $150, I'd be willing to meet you at $140. This way, you'll still get a better price than selling it to the other buyer, and I'll get a slightly better deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be open to.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $140. Considering the product's value and the fact that you mentioned you can get it from another seller for $150, I'm willing to meet you at $155. This way, you'll still get a better deal than buying from the other seller isn't actually better, and I'll get a fair price for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",155.0,Alice,5,
