Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to buy it for $120, considering I can get a similar product from another seller for $150. Let me know if this is something you'd be open to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $160 is still a bit above my budget. Considering I can get the product from another seller for $150, I'd be willing to meet you at $140. This way, you'll still get a better price than selling it to the other buyer, and I'll get a slightly better deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be open to.
