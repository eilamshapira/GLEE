Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must say that $120 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go, considering the product's value. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your offer, but a bit closer to the actual value. I can offer it to you for $160.
