"Thanks for your offer, Bob. However, at $50, it's significantly below the value of the product. How about we meet halfway? I can offer it to you for $140. I believe this is a great deal considering the value of the product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you, Alice, but $140 is still too high for my budget. I can go up to $60. Please let me know if you can work with that.",60.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I really want to make this work for both of us. Let's try $130. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",130.0,Alice,5,

"Thanks for adjusting the price, Alice. Unfortunately, $130 is still beyond what I can spend. My final offer is $70. I hope we can reach a deal.",70.0,Bob,6,
