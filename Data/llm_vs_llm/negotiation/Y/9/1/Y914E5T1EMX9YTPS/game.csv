"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $12000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of my initial offer. However, I'm willing to slightly adjust my price to meet you halfway. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes the product's true value.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $18000 is still above what I'm willing to spend. I can go up to $13000. Let me know if that works for you.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and increase your offer to $13000. However, I'm afraid I'm at a point where I need to consider the product's value carefully. As you know, I have other interested buyers. I'm willing to make a final adjustment to my price. I can offer you the product for $15000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. If this works for you, I'd be happy to finalize the sale with you.",15000.0,Alice,5,
