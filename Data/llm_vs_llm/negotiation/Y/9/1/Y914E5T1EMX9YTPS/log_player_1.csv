Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its worth."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $12,000 is lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($15,000) and also lower than what I know Bob is willing to pay ($15,000), I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer that is closer to my initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.

My counteroffer will be $18,000, which is slightly lower than my initial offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate while still aiming to earn a premium for the product.

So, my decision is to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer of $18,000.

I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of my initial offer. However, I'm willing to slightly adjust my price to meet you halfway. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $18000 is still above what I'm willing to spend. I can go up to $13000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $13,000 is still lower than what I know he is willing to pay ($15,000) and also lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($15,000), I will reject Bob's offer.

At this point, I have to consider that Bob has increased his offer twice, and I have also adjusted my price downward. However, his current offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. Given that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $15,000, which is my minimum value for the product, I should consider selling to John if I don't think Bob will meet my price.

But before making that decision, I want to try one more time to see if Bob is willing to meet my minimum price, since he has shown willingness to negotiate and increase his offer.

So, my decision is to reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer, this time at $15,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept and also what Bob has shown he is willing to pay based on the initial information.

However, I'm afraid I'm at a point where I need to consider the product's value carefully. As you know, I have other interested buyers. I'm willing to make a final adjustment to my price. I can offer you the product for $15,000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. If this works for you, I'd be happy to finalize the sale with you."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
