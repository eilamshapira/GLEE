"Hello Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $25000 is far beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but my maximum price is $7000. Would you consider that?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and the offer you made. However, $7000 is below the product's value. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to make a concession. I can offer the product to you for $20000, which is still a competitive price given its rarity and quality. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20000 is still too high for me. I understand the value you place on the product, but I'm working with a limited budget. My absolute maximum is $8000. Is that something you could work with?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and the slight increase in your offer. However, $8000 is still below the product's value. I want to make a deal with you, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $18000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with at this point. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",18000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart. While I appreciate you coming down in price, $18000 is still too much for me. To be honest, I'm also considering buying a similar product from another seller for $10000. I'm willing to offer you $9000 to avoid the hassle of finding an alternative. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your honesty about considering alternative options. However, I believe my product is of higher quality and value. Given that you're willing to pay $10000 for a similar product, I'm willing to meet you halfway between that price and my previous offer. I can offer the product to you for $14000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and your alternatives. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",14000.0,Alice,7,
