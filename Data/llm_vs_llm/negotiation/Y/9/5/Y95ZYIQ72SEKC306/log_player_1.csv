"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $25,000. I believe it's a fair price, but I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $25000 is far beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but my maximum price is $7000. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $7,000 is significantly lower than my initial price and the value I know the product holds (at least $15,000), I choose to reject his offer. I will proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer, aiming to find a price that is more acceptable to both of us. Selling to John for $15,000 is an option, but I want to explore the possibility of getting a better price from Bob first."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and the offer you made. However, $7,000 is below the product's value. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to make a concession. I can offer the product to you for $20,000, which is still a competitive price given its rarity and quality. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $20000 is still too high for me. I understand the value you place on the product, but I'm working with a limited budget. My absolute maximum is $8000. Is that something you could work with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's new offer of $8,000 is still significantly lower than my last offer and the value I know the product holds. Given that I have a guaranteed sale option with John for $15,000, I'm not inclined to accept such a low price. I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer, trying to find a middle ground that is closer to the product's actual value."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and the slight increase in your offer. However, $8,000 is still below the product's value. I want to make a deal with you, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $18,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with at this point. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still quite far apart. While I appreciate you coming down in price, $18000 is still too much for me. To be honest, I'm also considering buying a similar product from another seller for $10000. I'm willing to offer you $9000 to avoid the hassle of finding an alternative. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's new offer of $9,000 is still lower than what I'm willing to accept, especially considering the product's value. The mention of a similar product from another seller for $10,000 suggests that Bob is willing to pay more, but is trying to negotiate a better deal with me. Given that I have a guaranteed sale option with John for $15,000, I'm not inclined to accept such a low price. I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer, trying to find a middle ground that is closer to the product's actual value."

Round 7

Given that you're willing to pay $10,000 for a similar product, I'm willing to meet you halfway between that price and my previous offer. I can offer the product to you for $14,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and your alternatives. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
