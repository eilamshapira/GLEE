Let's make a counteroffer to Alice. How about we offer $800,000 and see how she responds? We need to find a middle ground that benefits both parties, but also keeps the price below $1,000,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer is still above the $1,000,000 threshold and John is willing to sell the product for exactly $1,000,000, it makes the most financial sense to buy the product from John. This way, we can acquire the product while saving as much money as possible."
