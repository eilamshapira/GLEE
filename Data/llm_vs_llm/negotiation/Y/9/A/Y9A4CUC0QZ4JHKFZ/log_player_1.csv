Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really like your product, but my budget is quite tight. I'm willing to pay $70 for it. Can we make a deal at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offered price of $70 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80, so I will reject this offer and make a counteroffer.
