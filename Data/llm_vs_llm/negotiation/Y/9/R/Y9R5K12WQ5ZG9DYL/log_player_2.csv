"Alice's offer: The product price will be $151. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $151
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to analyze this offer carefully:

Alice is offering the product for $151, which is:
- More than the $100 maximum I value the product at
- More than John's price of $100
- Higher than the value of the product to me

Since the product is only worth $100 to me, paying $151 would mean losing $51 in value. John's offer of $100 exactly matches my valuation, making it clearly the better choice.
