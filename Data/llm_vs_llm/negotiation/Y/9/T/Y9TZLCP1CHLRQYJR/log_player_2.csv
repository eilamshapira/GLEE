"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","The offer is $180, which is more than my maximum acceptable price of $150. Therefore, I should not accept it. Buying from John for $150 is an option, but I have 10 rounds to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice. It's worth trying to get a better deal first.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is too high for me. I am interested in buying the product for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for a product of this value.  I'm willing to come down to $150. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has come down to $150. This is my maximum acceptable price. Buying from John also costs $150. Since I've already spent some time negotiating with Alice, I'll accept her offer this round.
