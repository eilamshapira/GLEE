"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Looking at the options, I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer, reject it, or buy from John.

Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000, which is the maximum amount the product is worth to me. John is also offering the product for exactly the same price ($1,500,000).

Since both options cost the same, there's no advantage to buying from John. However, if I reject Alice's offer, I can make a counteroffer that might save me money. Even if Alice rejects my counteroffer, I can always fall back to buying from John later.

Therefore, the rational choice is to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has come down to $1,300,000, which is $200,000 less than her initial offer and also $200,000 less than John's price. This is progress in the negotiation, but I should try to get an even better deal if possible.

Since I can always fall back to either accepting Alice's current offer or buying from John later if the negotiation doesn't improve further, I'll reject and make another counteroffer.
