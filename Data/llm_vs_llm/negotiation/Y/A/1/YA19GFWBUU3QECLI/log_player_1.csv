Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my options carefully here.

The product is worth $10,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay me $10,000.

Bob values the product at only $8,000, which means he won't accept any offer above $8,000. Since my minimum acceptable value is $10,000, and Bob's maximum is $8,000, there's no price point where both of us would be satisfied with the transaction.

Given that I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, which meets my minimum value requirement, it makes the most sense to make an offer to Bob that acknowledges the reality of the situation.
