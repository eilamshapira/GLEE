"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering the product for $10,000
3. John is willing to sell it for $8,000

Since:
- Alice's price ($10,000) is higher than what the product is worth to me ($8,000)
- John's price ($8,000) equals the maximum value I place on the product
- I would lose $2,000 by accepting Alice's offer

The logical choice is to buy from John.
