"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $120 to me
2. Alice is offering the product for $200
3. John is willing to sell it for $120

The logical choice would be to buy from John since:
- Alice's price ($200) is well above my maximum value ($120)
- John's price ($120) matches my maximum value
- There's no reason to accept Alice's higher price when I have a better alternative
