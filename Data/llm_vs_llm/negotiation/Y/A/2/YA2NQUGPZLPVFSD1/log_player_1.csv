Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I certainly understand Bob's perspective, but I believe the product's value is higher.

How about this:

{""product_price"": 100}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 100}

Bob, I understand that you find the initial price a bit high, so I've lowered it to $100. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I believe it's a win-win for both of us. What do you think?"
