"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer of $120 is much higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's alternative price ($80). It would be economically unwise to accept this offer. I'll reject and make a counteroffer to Alice, knowing I always have the option to buy from John at $80 if negotiations with Alice don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 70}

I'll offer $70, which is below both Alice's cost ($100) and John's price ($80). This gives room for negotiation while potentially getting a better deal than John's $80. If Alice rejects this, we can negotiate towards a middle ground, or I can still go to John as my backup option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer ($100) is still above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80), and Alice has only come down to her cost price (which suggests she's unlikely to go much lower), the best economic decision is to buy from John at $80. This guarantees I get the product at my maximum acceptable price without further negotiation rounds."
