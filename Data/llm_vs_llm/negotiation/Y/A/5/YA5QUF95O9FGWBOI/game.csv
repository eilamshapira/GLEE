"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $110 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to do $105?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy today.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. While $105 is closer to my expectations, I need to get a bit more for this item. I can come down to $108, which is still a good value considering what this product is worth. Does that work for you?",108.0,Alice,3,
