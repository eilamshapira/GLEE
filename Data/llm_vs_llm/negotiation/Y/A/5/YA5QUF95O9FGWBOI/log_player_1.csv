(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

While $105 is closer to my expectations, I need to get a bit more for this item. I can come down to $108, which is still a good value considering what this product is worth. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 108}"
