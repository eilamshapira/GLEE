"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'd like to offer you this product which I'm confident will be of great value to you. My asking price is $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

I'm going to try to get a better price from Alice. $110 is too close to my maximum, and I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $110 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to do $105?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy today."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. While $105 is closer to my expectations, I need to get a bit more for this item. I can come down to $108, which is still a good value considering what this product is worth. Does that work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

$108 is still within my budget and a good deal, so I'll accept Alice's offer."
