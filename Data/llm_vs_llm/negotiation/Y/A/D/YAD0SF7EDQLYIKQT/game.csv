"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love. Given its exceptional quality and value, I'm pricing it at $150. I believe it's a fair price considering what it can do for you. Let me know if you're interested!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, though. Would you be willing to sell it for $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to make an offer. However, I must say that $75 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $140. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down to $140, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I think that would be a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, and I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $120. This price still represents a compromise on my part, but it's closer to what I'm looking for. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the new offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $120 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $100? This is the maximum I can go, and I think it's a fair price given the circumstances.",100.0,Bob,6,
