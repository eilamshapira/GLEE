Bob's offer:

You have three options:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the new offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $120 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $100? This is the maximum I can go, and I think it's a fair price given the circumstances.

Since Bob's offer of $100 is equal to what John is willing to pay, and further negotiations with Bob are unlikely to result in a higher price, I will accept Bob's offer."
