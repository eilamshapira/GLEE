You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's product is worth $12,000 to her and only $10,000 to me, I'll start with a low offer to leave room for negotiation, but not too low to be insulting.

{""product_price"": 8500}

This offer is significantly below both Alice's value and John's price, giving room for negotiation while still being a reasonable starting point. If Alice rejects this, we can gradually work towards a mutually acceptable price, keeping in mind that I can always fall back to John's $10,000 offer."
