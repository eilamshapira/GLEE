"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","$250 is well above the $150 value the product is worth to me, and even above Alice's value of the product. I can buy the product from John for exactly $150, which matches the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, I can try to negotiate with Alice first to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives Alice some profit but is still below John's price.
