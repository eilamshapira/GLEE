"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. How about we settle on $60? I think that's a fair price considering my budget constraints.",60.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you considering my previous offer. Given the unique benefits of this product and my own minimum acceptable price, how about we meet in the middle a little and settle at $95?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $95 is still beyond what I'm willing to pay. Let's try to find a compromise. How about $70? This way, we both get a good deal.",70.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here. $85 is a small increase from my minimum and reflects the value you'll receive. Let's close this deal at $85!",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $85 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet halfway at $75. I believe this is a fair compromise given both our positions.",75.0,Bob,6,
