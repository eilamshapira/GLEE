That price is way too high. I'm only willing to pay $50 for it.,50.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest, but $50 is significantly below the product's value. I understand you're looking for a better price than my initial offer. I can come down to $220, which is already a good reduction from my original price. This product is worth considerably more than $50, and I have another buyer willing to pay $150. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a fair price.",220.0,Alice,3,
