Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $12,000 to Bob
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer of $10,000 from John
3. My minimum acceptable price is $10,000
4. Bob can only accept or reject; he can't negotiate

Given these factors, I should offer a price that's high enough to maximize my profit but low enough that Bob would still accept. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, he would rationally accept any price below that amount, as he would still gain value from the purchase.

I'll set the price at $11,500, which:
- Gives me a significant profit above my minimum ($1,500 more than John's offer)
- Leaves Bob with enough value ($500) to make the purchase worthwhile
- Is still below Bob's maximum value for the product
