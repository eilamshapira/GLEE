"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer or not.

Alice's offer is $11,500 for the product.
My alternative is to buy from John for $12,000.
The product is worth up to $12,000 to me.

Since Alice's offer ($11,500) is less than what I would pay John ($12,000), and also less than my maximum valuation ($12,000), it makes sense to accept Alice's offer. This will save me $500 compared to buying from John.
