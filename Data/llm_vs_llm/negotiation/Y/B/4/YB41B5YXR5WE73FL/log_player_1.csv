Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price to offer Bob for my product. 

My considerations:
- The product is worth at least $8,000 to me
- I have a guaranteed backup buyer (John) at $8,000
- I don't know how much Bob values the product
- If I set the price too high, Bob might reject it
- If I set it too low, I might leave money on the table

Given that I have a guaranteed $8,000 from John, I should offer Bob a price higher than this amount. I'll make a reasonable markup while keeping it attractive enough that Bob might accept.
