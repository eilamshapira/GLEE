Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this offer:

1. I know the product is worth at least $8,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $8,000
3. Bob's valuation is unknown, but he might value it higher
4. Since I have nothing to lose (due to John's guaranteed offer), I can aim high

Given these factors, I'll propose a significantly higher price to Bob. If he accepts, I'll make a better profit. If he rejects, I still have my $8,000 from John.
