"Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  I believe that's a fair offer considering its value and the current market.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1000000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1300000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you consider $1150000? That's a significant move on my part, and I'm hoping we can find a compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I'm hoping it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer!  I appreciate the flexibility. How about we split the difference and settle at $1200000? That's my final offer.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
