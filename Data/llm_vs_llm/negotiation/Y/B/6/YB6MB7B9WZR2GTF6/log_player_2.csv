""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much room there is for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1000000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'll continue negotiating."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you consider $1,150,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I'm hoping we can find a compromise."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

I'm increasing my offer significantly but staying below my maximum budget and John's offer. This shows Alice I'm serious but also sets a firm limit."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I'm hoping it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Alice is getting very close to John's price, but I think there's still room to negotiate a slightly better deal.  I'll counteroffer once more."

}
``` 

I'm matching John's price now. This puts the ball in Alice's court and lets her know I have an alternative if she doesn't budge."
