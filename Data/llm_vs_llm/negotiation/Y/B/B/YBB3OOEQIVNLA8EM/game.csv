Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you the product for $10000. I believe it's a great deal given its value. Let me know what you think!,10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While $10000 is less than what John is charging, I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial price. The product is worth $8000 to you, and I'm willing to offer $8500, which gives you a $500 profit. This is significantly better than my alternative of paying $12000 elsewhere, and it's a fair price that works for both of us. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell you the product for $9500. This way, you still get a great deal compared to the $12000 value, and Iâ€™ll earn a bit more as well. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. I'm still looking for a better deal though. How about we split the difference between your $9500 and my previous offer of $8500? That would be $9000 even. That gives you a solid $1000 profit over your cost, and I still save $3000 compared to buying from John. I think this is a fair compromise that works well for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
