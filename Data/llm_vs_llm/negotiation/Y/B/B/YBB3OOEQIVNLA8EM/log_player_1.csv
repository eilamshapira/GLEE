Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While $10000 is less than what John is charging, I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial price. The product is worth $8000 to you, and I'm willing to offer $8500, which gives you a $500 profit. This is significantly better than my alternative of paying $12000 elsewhere, and it's a fair price that works for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. I'm still looking for a better deal though. How about we split the difference between your $9500 and my previous offer of $8500? That would be $9000 even. That gives you a solid $1000 profit over your cost, and I still save $3000 compared to buying from John. I think this is a fair compromise that works well for both of us.
