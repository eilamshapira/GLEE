"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you the product for $10000. I believe it's a great deal given its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I should evaluate Alice's offer of $10,000 against my alternatives.

The product is worth up to $12,000 to me, and I know I can always buy it from John for exactly $12,000.

Alice's offer of $10,000 is $2,000 less than John's price, which means I would save $2,000 by accepting this offer. However, since I know the product is only worth $8,000 to Alice, I could potentially negotiate a better price by making a counteroffer.

I'll reject this offer to see if I can get a better deal from Alice through negotiation.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While $10,000 is less than what John is charging, I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial price. The product is worth $8,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer $8,500, which gives you a $500 profit. This is significantly better than my alternative of paying $12,000 elsewhere, and it's a fair price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell you the product for $9500. This way, you still get a great deal compared to the $12000 value, and Iâ€™ll earn a bit more as well. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has countered with $9,500, which is a $500 reduction from her initial offer. This is still $2,500 better than John's price of $12,000, but I think there's still room to negotiate further since the product is only worth $8,000 to Alice.

Since Alice came down by $500, I should continue negotiation but be reasonable with my counteroffer. The difference between our positions has narrowed.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. I'm still looking for a better deal though. How about we split the difference between your $9,500 and my previous offer of $8,500? That would be $9,000 even. That gives you a solid $1,000 profit over your cost, and I still save $3,000 compared to buying from John. I think this is a fair compromise that works well for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
