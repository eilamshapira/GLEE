Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about the optimal price to offer Bob:

1. The product is worth $15,000 to Bob
2. My minimum acceptable price is $8,000
3. If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed $8,000 from John
4. Bob will likely reject if the price is too close to $15,000
5. I should offer a price that gives Bob some surplus but maximizes my profit

I'll offer a price of $12,500, which:
- Gives Bob a $2,500 surplus ($15,000 - $12,500)
- Gives me a $4,500 premium over my fallback option ($12,500 - $8,000)
- Is likely to be accepted as it splits the difference relatively fairly
