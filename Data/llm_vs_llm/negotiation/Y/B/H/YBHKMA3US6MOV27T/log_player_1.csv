"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a high initial offer to test Bob's willingness to pay.

{""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than John's guaranteed $1,000,000, and it represents a reasonable increase from my minimum acceptable price, I'll accept this offer.
