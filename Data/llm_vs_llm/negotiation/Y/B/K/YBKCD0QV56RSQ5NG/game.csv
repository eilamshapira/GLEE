"Hello Bob, I have a product that I'd like to offer you. I believe this product can provide significant value, and I'm offering it to you for $17500. This price reflects the quality and value of the product I'm selling. Would you be interested in making this purchase?",17500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I find the price a bit high. I'm looking to spend no more than $10000. Would you be willing to negotiate the price down to this amount?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $10000, I cannot accept that price as the product is worth at least $15000 to me. I already have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $15000 for it. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. My counteroffer is $15500. This is very close to my minimum acceptable price, but still provides you with value for your investment. Would this work for you?",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $15500 is still much higher than I'm willing to pay. I can increase my offer to $11000. This is still significantly lower than your asking price, but it's the highest I can go.",11000.0,Bob,4,
