Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $10,000, I cannot accept that price as the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. I already have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $15,000 for it. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. My counteroffer is $15,500. This is very close to my minimum acceptable price, but still provides you with value for your investment.
