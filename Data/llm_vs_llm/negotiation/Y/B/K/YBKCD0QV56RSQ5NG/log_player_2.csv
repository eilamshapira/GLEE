Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $10000, I cannot accept that price as the product is worth at least $15000 to me. I already have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $15000 for it. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. My counteroffer is $15500. This is very close to my minimum acceptable price, but still provides you with value for your investment. Would this work for you?

# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $15,500 is still much higher than I'm willing to pay. I can increase my offer to $11,000. This is still significantly lower than your asking price, but it's the highest I can go.
