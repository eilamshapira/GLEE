"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, $25000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm looking to spend no more than $10000. Would you be willing to sell the product for $5000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $5000 is unfortunately far too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $18000, as a starting point for further negotiation.  Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that we're still quite a bit apart on the price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $6000, but that's still much less than what you're asking. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're still apart on price. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers.  $12000 is my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to other options.  ",12000.0,Alice,5,
