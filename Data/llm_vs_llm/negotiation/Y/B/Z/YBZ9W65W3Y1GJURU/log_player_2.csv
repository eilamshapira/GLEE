Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, $25,000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm looking to spend no more than $10,000. Would you be willing to sell the product for $5,000?"

Alice, I understand that we're still quite a bit apart on the price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $6,000, but that's still much less than what you're asking. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?"
