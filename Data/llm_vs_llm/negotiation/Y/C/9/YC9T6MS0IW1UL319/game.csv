"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to close the deal quickly. However, I was hoping we could find a middle ground that reflects the product's true value. Considering your budget and my initial price, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to offer the product to you for $10500. I believe this price is more reasonable and takes into account the product's worth.",10500.0,Alice,3,
