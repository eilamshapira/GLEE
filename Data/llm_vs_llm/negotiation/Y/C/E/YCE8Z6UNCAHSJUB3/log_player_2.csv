"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $2,000,000 is way above my maximum value of $1,000,000. Since I can always buy from John for $1,000,000, there's no reason to accept any offer above that amount. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to be insulting.

{""product_price"": 500000}

This offer is 50% of John's price and gives room for negotiation while still potentially allowing me to save money compared to buying from John. If Alice's cost is significantly lower than $1,000,000, this could be an attractive offer while giving me substantial savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,800,000 is still significantly above John's price of $1,000,000. There's no reason to accept this offer when I have a guaranteed option to buy at $1,000,000. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a price point that works for both of us but is below John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still keep it well below John's price to try to find a middle ground.

{""product_price"": 700000}

This offer is a significant increase from my previous offer of $500,000, showing willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a good potential savings compared to John's price. It sends a signal that I'm willing to move up but also that I won't go anywhere near the $1,800,000 she suggested, as I have the $1,000,000 alternative from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offers are still far above John's price of $1,000,000. While she's slowly coming down (from $2M to $1.8M to $1.7M), she's still not close to a price that would be better than my alternative with John. Since I can always buy from John for $1,000,000, I'll continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more reasonable price point. If Alice doesn't make significant movement downward in the next rounds, I may need to consider taking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer again to show continued good faith in negotiations, but still maintain a clear advantage over John's price.

{""product_price"": 850000}

This offer is a significant increase from my previous offer of $700,000, demonstrating that I'm willing to continue moving up. However, it still leaves me with a $150,000 savings compared to John's price. It also signals to Alice that I'm not going to consider anything above $1,000,000 since that's my alternative option with John. If Alice doesn't come down to a price below $1,000,000 soon, I'll need to seriously consider taking John's offer rather than continuing negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'm choosing to buy from John for $1,000,000. Here's why:

1. Alice's offers have only come down slowly ($2M → $1.8M → $1.7M → $1.6M), and she's still $600,000 above John's price
2. We've gone through 7 rounds out of 10, and Alice hasn't shown any indication she'll drop below $1,000,000
3. The incremental decreases in Alice's offers (about $100,000 each time) suggest that even with the remaining rounds, she's unlikely to reach a price below John's $1,000,000
4. There's a risk in continuing negotiations that we might run out of rounds without reaching an agreement

Therefore, it's most rational to take the guaranteed option of buying from John for $1,000,000 rather than continue negotiations that show little promise of beating that price."
