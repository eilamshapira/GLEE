"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for Round 1:

```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $150. Here's my reasoning:

*   **Maximize Potential Profit:** I want to see how high Bob is willing to go. Starting higher allows me to gauge his interest and potential value he places on the product.
*   **Negotiation Room:** This price gives me ample room to negotiate downwards if needed. I can always reduce the price in later rounds.
*   **Protecting My Floor:** My minimum acceptable price is $80 (the John offer). $150 gives me a significant buffer to work with.
*   **Early Indication:** Bob's response to this initial offer will tell me a lot about his willingness to pay and his overall interest.

I'm looking forward to Bob's response."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $70 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80 (what John is offering). I will reject his offer and prepare a counteroffer in the next round. Selling to John is an option, but it makes sense to see if I can still get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob for Round 3:

```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob came in very low with his offer of $70. I'm not going to jump down to meet him in the middle immediately. Here's my strategy:

*   **Slightly Lower, but Still High:** I'm reducing the price by $10 from my initial offer. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate.
*   **Anchoring Effect:** By staying in a higher range, I'm still anchoring the negotiation toward a more profitable outcome for me.
*   **Information Gathering:** His response to this price will give me further insight into his willingness to pay. If he rejects this offer out of hand, it'll tell me he's likely not a serious buyer at a price I'm comfortable with.

I'm waiting to see what Bob does next."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is inching up, but $75 is still below my minimum of $80. I'm going to reject and continue negotiating. Selling to John is still an option, but I'm going to try one more counteroffer to Bob. There is still 6 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $75 is still too low. However, he *is* moving in the right direction, which is encouraging. Here's my reasoning for this round's counteroffer:

*   **Another Increment Down:** I'm reducing the price by another $10. This continues to show willingness to negotiate, without drastically undercutting my position.
*   **Still Above $100:** I'm keeping the price above $100 for now. This signals to Bob that I believe the item is worth more than his offers, and I'm not going to simply give it away.
*   **Evaluating Bob's Motivation:** How Bob responds to this offer will be critical. Is he really interested, or just trying to get a steal?

I am curious to see what Bob will offer next. I will have to start considering John's offer if Bob does not raise his price to at least $80 in the next round."
