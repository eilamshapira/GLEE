"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, and John is willing to sell it for $80, there's no way I would accept an offer of $150. I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to negotiate a better price. If we can't reach a reasonable agreement, I can always fall back on John's $80 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 70}

I'll offer $70 for the product. This is a reasonable counteroffer because:
1. It's below my maximum value of $80
2. It leaves some room for negotiation if Alice counteroffers
3. If Alice accepts, I'll save $10 compared to John's price
4. Even if Alice rejects, I can always go back to John's offer of $80"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll continue to reject Alice's offer because:
1. $140 is still significantly higher than my maximum value of $80
2. John's offer of $80 is still much better than Alice's current offer
3. I still have several rounds to negotiate, so I can try to get a better price from Alice
4. If negotiations don't improve, I can always fall back on John's $80 offer

I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 75}

I'll slightly increase my offer to $75 to show some flexibility in negotiation. This offer is strategic because:
1. It's still below my maximum value of $80
2. It shows willingness to move up from my previous offer of $70
3. It's still a good deal for me if accepted, saving $5 compared to John's price
4. It maintains room for further negotiation while demonstrating good faith
5. If Alice continues to be unreasonable, I can still go with John's offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John for $80 because:
1. Alice's price is still way above my maximum value of $80
2. Even though Alice has shown some willingness to lower the price (from $150 to $130), she's still far from a reasonable price
3. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and the gap between our positions is still too large
4. John's offer of $80 is guaranteed and matches my maximum value
5. Continuing to negotiate with Alice might waste more time without reaching an acceptable price

It's better to take the sure deal with John than continue this negotiation where Alice seems unlikely to come down to an acceptable price."
