"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1400000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1250000, which is still a fair price considering the potential I see. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1250000 is a respectable offer, the value this product brings is truly significant. I'm confident you'll see a substantial return on this investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1325000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
