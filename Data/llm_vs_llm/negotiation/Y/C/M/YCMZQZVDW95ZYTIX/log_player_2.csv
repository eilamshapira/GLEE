"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Okay, let's analyze this.

*   **My Value:** $100 (maximum I'm willing to pay)
*   **Alice's Offer:** $95
*   **John's Offer:** $100
*   **My Target:** Buy the product for as little as possible.

Since the price from Alice is less than John's price, I should not choose ""BuyFromJhon"". Also, the current price from Alice is less than my value of the product, therefore, it's a good deal for me.

**Decision: {""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}**"
