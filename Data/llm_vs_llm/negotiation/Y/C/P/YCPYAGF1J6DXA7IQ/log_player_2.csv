"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Knowing its value to you, I believe $900000 is a fair price for its acquisition. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given the information provided:

1. The product is worth $800,000 to you (maximum value)
2. John is willing to sell it to you for $800,000
3. Alice is offering it for $900,000

Alice's offer exceeds the maximum value of the product to you, and it's also $100,000 more than John's price. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer or make a counteroffer since you already have a better alternative with John.
