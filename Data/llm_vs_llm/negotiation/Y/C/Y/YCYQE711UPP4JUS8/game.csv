"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. I've done my research and I think that's a fair price. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, and understand your perspective on the value.  However, I'm confident this product offers significant untapped potential that justifies a higher price point. How about we meet in the middle at $12500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11000. I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
