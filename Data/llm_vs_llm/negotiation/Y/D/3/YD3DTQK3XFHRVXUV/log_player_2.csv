"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $120 is too high for me since the product is only worth $80 to me. I would lose value by accepting this offer. I can either make a counteroffer to Alice or buy from John for $80. Since I can always buy from John for $80, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate with Alice for a better price first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 70}

I'll offer $70 to Alice. This is below John's price of $80, giving me some room to negotiate upward if needed. Since the product is worth $120 to Alice, there's potential for us to find a mutually beneficial price between $70 and $80. If Alice rejects this offer, I can still either negotiate further or fall back on John's offer of $80."
