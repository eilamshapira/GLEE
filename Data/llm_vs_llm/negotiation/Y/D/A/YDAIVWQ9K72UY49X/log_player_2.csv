"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,200,000 (which is also the price John is offering). It would not be rational to accept this offer since it's $800,000 above my maximum value and John's price. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round, starting lower to leave room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 800000}

I'm starting with a relatively low offer of $800,000, which is significantly below John's price of $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate upward while still potentially getting a better deal than John's price. If Alice rejects this, I can gradually increase my offer in subsequent rounds while still maintaining a buffer below the $1,200,000 alternative from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,800,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000). While she did reduce her price from the initial $2,000,000, it's still not a reasonable offer from my perspective. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round. If we can't reach a reasonable agreement soon, I always have the option to buy from John at $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm increasing my offer to $1,000,000, which is $200,000 higher than my previous offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and move towards a middle ground, while still staying below John's price of $1,200,000. This gives me room for further negotiation if needed, while potentially securing a better deal than John's offer. If Alice continues to demand prices above $1,200,000, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I've decided to buy from John for $1,200,000. Here's why:

1. Alice's latest offer ($1,600,000) is still $400,000 above John's price and my maximum value
2. After several rounds of negotiation, Alice's price reductions have been relatively small (from $2M to $1.8M to $1.6M)
3. The pattern suggests Alice is unlikely to drop her price below $1,200,000 in the remaining rounds
4. Rather than waste more rounds on negotiations that seem unlikely to result in a better deal than John's offer, it's more practical to take the guaranteed price of $1,200,000 from John

While there are still rounds remaining for negotiation, the risk of missing out on John's offer while pursuing an unlikely better deal from Alice isn't worth it."
