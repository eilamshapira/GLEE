"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I think you'll love it. How about I offer it to you for $200?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $200 is way too high for me. The product is only worth about $80 to me, which is what another seller (John) is offering. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it if you're interested in making a deal today.",60.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good price. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $140 is still much higher than what I can justify. As I mentioned, I can get the same product from John for $80, which is actually the maximum I'm willing to pay. To make it worth switching from John to you, I could offer $70. What do you think?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have other options, but this product is really worth it. Let's try $130. That is a great deal for you, considering its high value and you won't find it anywhere else.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but I need to be clear: the product is only worth $80 to me maximum, and I already have an offer from John at exactly $80. If you want my business, you'll need to beat that price. I'm willing to pay $75, which saves me a bit of money and gives you a sale. Otherwise, I'll have to go with John's offer.",75.0,Bob,6,
