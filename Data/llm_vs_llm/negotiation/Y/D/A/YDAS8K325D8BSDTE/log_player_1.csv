"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I think you'll love it. How about I offer it to you for $200?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $200 is way too high for me. The product is only worth about $80 to me, which is what another seller (John) is offering. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it if you're interested in making a deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Okay, Bob's offer is $60, and I need to make a decision. My minimum is $120, so $60 is not acceptable. I also don't want to sell to John just yet, as I can potentially get more from Bob.

Therefore:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good price. How about we meet in the middle at $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $140 is still much higher than what I can justify. As I mentioned, I can get the same product from John for $80, which is actually the maximum I'm willing to pay. To make it worth switching from John to you, I could offer $70. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer is $70 now. This is still below my $120 threshold. I'm starting to think Bob might be lowballing me, and I only have 7 rounds left. While I'd prefer more, securing $120 is a good outcome.

I'll hold out one more round to see if Bob comes closer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have other options, but this product is really worth it. Let's try $130. That is a great deal for you, considering its high value and you won't find it anywhere else."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but I need to be clear: the product is only worth $80 to me maximum, and I already have an offer from John at exactly $80. If you want my business, you'll need to beat that price. I'm willing to pay $75, which saves me a bit of money and gives you a sale. Otherwise, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob is firm on his offer of $75, and is stating he can get the product elsewhere. He states the product is worth $80 at most. He wants to pay $75. I only have 5 rounds left. I need to make a decision here.

Given the low offers, I'm going to sell to John.
