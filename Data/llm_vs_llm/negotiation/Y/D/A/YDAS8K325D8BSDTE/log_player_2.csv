"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I think you'll love it. How about I offer it to you for $200? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's offer of $200 is significantly higher than the $80 that the product is worth to me, and higher than John's price of $80, I should not accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $200 is way too high for me. The product is only worth about $80 to me, which is what another seller (John) is offering. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it if you're interested in making a deal today."", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good price. How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's offer of $140 is still significantly higher than both the value of the product to me ($80) and John's price ($80). It doesn't make financial sense to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $140 is still much higher than what I can justify. As I mentioned, I can get the same product from John for $80, which is actually the maximum I'm willing to pay. To make it worth switching from John to you, I could offer $70. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have other options, but this product is really worth it. Let's try $130. That is a great deal for you, considering its high value and you won't find it anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's offer of $130 is still higher than both the value of the product to me ($80) and John's price ($80). It doesn't make financial sense to accept this offer when I have a better alternative.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but I need to be clear: the product is only worth $80 to me maximum, and I already have an offer from John at exactly $80. If you want my business, you'll need to beat that price. I'm willing to pay $75, which saves me a bit of money and gives you a sale. Otherwise, I'll have to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 75}"
