"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1000000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $700000 for it, reflecting a significant discount, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you, Bob, for your counteroffer. I understand that $1000000 might be out of your budget, but $700000 is lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I believe $900000 is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm happy to offer $800000, which is my absolute maximum. This would ensure a quick and efficient transaction for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
