"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start with a price that reflects its worth to me."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1000000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $700000 for it, reflecting a significant discount, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $700,000 because it's below the product's value to me and also below what I can get from John. I'll proceed to make a counteroffer to try and reach a mutually beneficial price. 

My counteroffer is $900,000. This price still reflects the high value I place on the product but shows willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you, Bob, for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,000,000 might be out of your budget, but $700,000 is lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I believe $900,000 is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm happy to offer $800000, which is my absolute maximum. This would ensure a quick and efficient transaction for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $800,000 matches the minimum value I have for the product and is also the same amount I could get from selling to John, it's a reasonable price. Accepting this offer ensures I get a fair deal without the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a lower price or no sale at all."
