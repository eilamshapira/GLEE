"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think $1400000 is a bit high for me. I'd like to counter with $1200000. What do you say?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make a profit. How about $1300000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I see where you're coming from, but $1300000 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we settle at $1250000? I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
