"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to consider my options carefully:

1. Accept Alice's offer at $200 - This exceeds the $120 maximum value the product has to me, so I would be overpaying.
2. Reject and make a counteroffer - This seems like the best option to potentially get a better price from Alice.
3. Buy from John for $120 - This is my fallback option that guarantees I get the product at exactly its maximum value to me.

Since Alice's initial offer of $200 is significantly above my maximum value of $120, I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives room for negotiation but is significantly lower than Alice's initial price.
