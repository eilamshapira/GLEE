"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I see the value in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000 for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a lower price point, $1000000 is actually the minimum value of this product to me. Given the product's quality and market potential, I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial offer. I can offer it to you for $1800000, which I believe represents excellent value considering what this product can deliver for you.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1800000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1400000. This offer represents a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for me.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
