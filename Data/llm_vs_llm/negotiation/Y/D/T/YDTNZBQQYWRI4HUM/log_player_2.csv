Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a lower price point, $1000000 is actually the minimum value of this product to me. Given the product's quality and market potential, I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial offer. I can offer it to you for $1800000, which I believe represents excellent value considering what this product can deliver for you.
