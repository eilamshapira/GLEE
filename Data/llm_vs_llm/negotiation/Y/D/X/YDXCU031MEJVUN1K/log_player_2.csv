"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $15000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer is exactly the same price as John's offer ($15,000), and this price is at my maximum value for the product, there's no advantage in continuing the negotiation with Alice. I could try to make a lower counteroffer, but if Alice rejects it, I risk wasting time and still ending up paying $15,000. Making a counteroffer might also cause Alice to walk away, leaving me with only John's option anyway.

Given these considerations, I'll choose to accept Alice's offer.
