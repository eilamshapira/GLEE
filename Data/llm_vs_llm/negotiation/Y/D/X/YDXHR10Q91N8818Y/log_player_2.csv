"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's initial offer of $100 is already below my maximum budget of $120, I'll consider it a good starting point. However, I'd like to try to negotiate a better price to save as much money as possible.

My decision for Round 1 is: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","For Round 2, I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer of $100, but still reasonable. I'll aim for a price that is significantly lower, but not so low that it's unlikely to be accepted.

My counteroffer is: {""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $90 is a compromise between her initial offer of $100 and my counteroffer of $80. It shows that she's willing to negotiate, but still wants to get a decent price for the product.

Considering that $90 is still below my maximum budget of $120, and it's a better offer than the initial $100, I'll think about accepting it. However, I'll also consider the fact that I have 8 more rounds to negotiate, and I might be able to get an even better deal.

For now, I'll choose to: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer to try to get the price down further. Maybe I can get Alice to meet me in the middle between $80 and $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","For Round 4, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous offer of $80, but still lower than Alice's current offer of $90. I'll aim for a price that is in the middle of the two offers, which is around $85.

My counteroffer is: {""product_price"": 85}"
