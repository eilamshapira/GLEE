"Hello Bob! I'm offering a high-quality product that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm selling it for $115. This is a fair price considering the market value, and it's a win-win for both of us. Are you interested?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product and see its value.  However, $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105, which is still a good price for you.  Let's see if we can make this work.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a better price, I need to consider my costs as well. I can come down to $112, which is still a good deal for the value you'll be getting. This represents a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from the transaction. What do you think?",112.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $112 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $108?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product and lets us both walk away satisfied.",108.0,Bob,4,
