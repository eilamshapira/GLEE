"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $600000 is lower than my initial price, it's not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for some flexibility. Let's find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
