Hi Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this product. I believe it's a fantastic fit for your needs. I'm offering it to you for $13000. What do you think?,13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $13000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7000 for the product. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your response! While I understand your budget constraints, I can’t go as low as $7000. How about I meet you halfway at $10500? I believe this is a fair price for the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10500 is still above what I'm comfortable spending. Could you consider coming down to $7500? I think that would be a fair compromise given my budget constraints.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your understanding and willingness to negotiate! While I can’t go down to $7500, I can offer you a price of $9500. This way, you’re getting a great deal, and I can still cover my costs. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your latest offer, but $9500 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $8000? This is the maximum I can go, and it's a fair price considering my budget. Let me know if this works for you.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest! While I understand your budget, I can’t quite let it go for $8000. I’d like to offer you a deal at $9000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it reflects the product's value. Let me know if this works for you!",9000.0,Alice,7,
