Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a reasonably high price to leave room for negotiation while still ensuring a good profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer ($60) is below my minimum acceptable value ($100), and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, there's no reason to accept Bob's low offer. While I could continue negotiating with Bob, his initial offer is so low that it suggests he might not be willing to meet my minimum price. The safe and profitable choice is to sell to John.
