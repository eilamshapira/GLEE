"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Based on market analysis and the product's value, I'm offering it to you for $18500. This is a competitive price given the product's specifications and benefits.",18500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I have a budget constraint. I can offer you $9000 for the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be transparent that $9000 is well below the product's value. I have another buyer willing to pay $15000, which represents the minimum value I can accept. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. My counteroffer is $15500, which is very close to my minimum acceptable price.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, $15500 is still too high for me. I can increase my offer to $9500. This is still a good deal for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but I need to be clear that $9500 is still significantly below what I can accept. The product costs me $15000, which is my absolute bottom line - I simply cannot sell below this price without taking a loss. I have another buyer ready at this price. My final offer to you is $15000, the same price I would get elsewhere. I'd prefer to work with you, but I need to be business-minded about this transaction.",15000.0,Alice,5,
