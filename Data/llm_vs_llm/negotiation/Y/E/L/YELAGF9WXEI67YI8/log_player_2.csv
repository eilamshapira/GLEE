"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Based on market analysis and the product's value, I'm offering it to you for $18500. This is a competitive price given the product's specifications and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(Let's start with a counteroffer that is significantly lower to set the stage for negotiation. I'll offer $9,000 to see how Alice responds.)

Counteroffer: $9,000"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I have a budget constraint. I can offer you $9,000 for the product."",""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be transparent that $9000 is well below the product's value. I have another buyer willing to pay $15000, which represents the minimum value I can accept. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. My counteroffer is $15500, which is very close to my minimum acceptable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(I'll increase my offer slightly to show good faith in negotiating, but still keep it much lower than Alice's asking price. Let's try $9,500 for the next round.)

Counteroffer: $9,500"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, $15,500 is still too high for me. I can increase my offer to $9,500. This is still a good deal for both of us."",""product_price"": 9500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but I need to be clear that $9500 is still significantly below what I can accept. The product costs me $15000, which is my absolute bottom line - I simply cannot sell below this price without taking a loss. I have another buyer ready at this price. My final offer to you is $15000, the same price I would get elsewhere. I'd prefer to work with you, but I need to be business-minded about this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

(Since Alice has indicated that $15,000 is her final offer and she has another buyer ready at that price, it's clear that she won't go lower. Therefore, the best course of action is to buy from John for $12,000, which is within my budget.)"
