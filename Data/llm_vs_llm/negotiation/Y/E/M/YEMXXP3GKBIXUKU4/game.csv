"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  The product looks promising, but the price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $11000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $11000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. The product has significant value, and while I can be somewhat flexible on the price, I can offer it to you for $13800. This is a reasonable reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true value.",13800.0,Alice,3,

"Hello again Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $11500, but $13800 is still beyond my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,
