"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $14,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  The product looks promising, but the price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, so I'll reject it and make a new counteroffer in the next round. Since I can still get $12,000 from John, there's no reason to accept an offer below that amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $11,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. The product has significant value, and while I can be somewhat flexible on the price, I can offer it to you for $13,800. This is a reasonable reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 13800}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello again Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $11500, but $13800 is still beyond my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer of $11,500 is still below John's guaranteed offer of $12,000, and Bob has only increased his offer by a small amount ($500), it seems unlikely that we'll reach a mutually beneficial price point. Rather than continuing negotiations that might not lead anywhere, I'll take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
