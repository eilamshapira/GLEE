"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $14500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is quite close to my maximum budget and leaves little room for negotiation.  I'll try to bring the price down with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  The product looks promising, but the price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $11000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. The product has significant value, and while I can be somewhat flexible on the price, I can offer it to you for $13800. This is a reasonable reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice lowered her price, it's still too high. I'll continue negotiating to try and reach a more agreeable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello again Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $11,500, but $13,800 is still beyond my budget."",

}
