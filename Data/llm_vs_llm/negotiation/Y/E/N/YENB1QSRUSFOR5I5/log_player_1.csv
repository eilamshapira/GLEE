Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","I'll counter Bob's offer since $1,000,000 is still quite a bit below what the product is worth to him, and significantly better than selling to John.
