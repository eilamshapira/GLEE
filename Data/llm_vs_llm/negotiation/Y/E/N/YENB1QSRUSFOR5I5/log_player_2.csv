While $1,300,000 is lower than my maximum budget, I believe there's room for negotiation to get the price closer to Alice's perceived value of $800,000."

This offer represents a significant saving for me while still being a good deal above Alice's perceived value."

Alice is coming down, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to push a little further."

This counteroffer shows I'm willing to meet Alice closer to the middle ground, but I'm still aiming for a price significantly below her initial offer."
