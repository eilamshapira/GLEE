"Alice, I appreciate the unique value of your product. However, I'm looking to make a more cost-effective investment. I'd like to propose purchasing the product for $1200000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects both the value of the product and our mutual benefits.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your desire for a cost-effective investment, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1200000 is below my bottom line. Let's meet in the middle. How about $1400000? This represents a significant reduction from my initial price and still allows me to realize a fair return on this invaluable asset.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I understand the value you see in the product, and I also want to ensure this is a worthwhile investment. Could we consider a price of $1300000? This is a competitive offer that I think represents a good compromise for us both.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer! $1300000 is a step in the right direction. However, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. My absolute lowest I can go right now is $1375000. I'm confident you'll see the return on this investment quickly.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
