I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
``` 

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, but I still need to get a better price than his last offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."
