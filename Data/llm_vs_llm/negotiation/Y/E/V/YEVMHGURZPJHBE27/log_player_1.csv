"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer of $100 is reasonable, as it's significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $80. While I could try to negotiate for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that prolonged negotiation might lead to Bob losing interest. Since $100 gives me a good profit margin, I'll accept this offer.
