"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $115 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to pay $105 for it.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit low considering the value of the product. I can come down to $110, which I believe is a fair middle ground that works for both of us. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
