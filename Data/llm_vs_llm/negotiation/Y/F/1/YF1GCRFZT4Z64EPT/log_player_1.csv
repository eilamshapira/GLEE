Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $115. This is a fair price considering its market value and quality. Would you like to purchase it?"", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $115 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to pay $105 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. While $105 is better than selling to John, I believe there's still room for negotiation since the product is worth $120 to Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit low considering the value of the product. I can come down to $110, which I believe is a fair middle ground that works for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks Alice, I understand. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to offer $107.

I'll accept Bob's offer of $107. This is a reasonable compromise that gives me $7 more than John's offer, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether."
