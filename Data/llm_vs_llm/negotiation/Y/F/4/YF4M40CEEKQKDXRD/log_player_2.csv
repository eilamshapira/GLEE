"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($15,000), and it's the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, I might as well buy from John since he's a guaranteed seller. There's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer in this case."
