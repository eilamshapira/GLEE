"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $12,000
2. John is also selling it for $12,000
3. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
4. Both offers are at my maximum value

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($12,000), and this is exactly at my maximum value point, there's no advantage to choosing one over the other. However, since Alice made the first offer, it would be reasonable to just accept her offer rather than go through the trouble of rejecting and buying from John.
