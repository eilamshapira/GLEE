"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer at $115
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John at $120

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and:
- The product is worth no more than $120 to me
- Alice's offer ($115) is less than John's price ($120)
- Alice's offer is within my maximum value ($120)

The best decision would be to accept Alice's offer as it saves me $5 compared to buying from John.
