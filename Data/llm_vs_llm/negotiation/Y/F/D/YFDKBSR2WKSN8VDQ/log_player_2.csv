"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Considering its unique qualities and the potential it holds, I'm offering it to you for $2500000. I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","The price that Alice is offering ($2,500,000) is significantly higher than the product's worth to me (no more than $1,000,000) and also higher than John's guaranteed price of $1,000,000. There's no reason to accept this offer or continue negotiating when I can get the same product at a much lower price from John.
