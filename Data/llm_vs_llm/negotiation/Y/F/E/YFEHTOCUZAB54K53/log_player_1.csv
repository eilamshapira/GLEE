"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Okay, I have to decide quickly. Selling for $100 is less than my minimum of $120. I also know John is waiting with an offer of $120.

Given the options, I will **reject** Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I am not willing to lose money.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 160}"

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Okay, let's analyze this: Bob is offering $110, which is still less than my minimum value of $120. John is offering $120.

I need to decide if it's worth the risk to continue negotiating with Bob, risking a lower price (or potentially no sale) versus taking the guaranteed $120 from John.

Since I'm only on round 4, I'll **reject** Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here's my next counteroffer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 140}"

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Okay, this is getting closer. Bob is offering $115 now, still less than my target of $120. But the rounds are ticking by.

John is still offering $120. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the rounds.

I'll **reject** Bob's offer. I still have time to get the $120 from John, or to try for a better deal with Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, let's try again.

{""product_price"": 130}"

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $118.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Alright, now we're getting down to the wire. Bob is offering $118. That's almost there.

But John is still offering $120. This is the turning point where I need to balance the risk of getting slightly less from Bob with the risk of *potentially* getting nothing if the negotiations with Bob fail.

I'm going to **reject** Bob's offer and try for a slightly better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, this is the second to last round. Here we go:
