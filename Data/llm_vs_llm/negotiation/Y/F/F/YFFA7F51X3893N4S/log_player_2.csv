"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $110. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me evaluate this offer:

The product is worth at most $120 to me, and I can buy it from John for $120 as my backup option.
Alice is offering the product for $110, which is $10 less than John's price.
The product is worth $80 to Alice, so she's making a $30 profit at $110.

Since Alice's offer ($110) is less than my maximum value ($120) and less than my alternative option (John's price of $120), it makes financial sense to accept Alice's offer.
