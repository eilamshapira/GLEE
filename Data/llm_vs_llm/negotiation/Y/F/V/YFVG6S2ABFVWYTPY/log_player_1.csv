Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us. My counteroffer will be $1,100,000. This price is still below Bob's initial valuation of $1,200,000 but higher than his counteroffer of $1,050,000, giving us room for further negotiation if needed."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $1100000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000, considering the product's value and what I've seen in the market. Would you be open to discussing this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Since Bob has come back with the same offer of $1,050,000, which is close to my previous counteroffer of $1,100,000, and considering that selling to John for $1,000,000 is the alternative, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best option to maximize my earnings. It's a reasonable price that acknowledges the product's value and Bob's willingness to pay a premium for it."
