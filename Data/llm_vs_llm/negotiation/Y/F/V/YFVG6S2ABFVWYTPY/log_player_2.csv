"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's initial offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay ($1,200,000), and I know I can get the same product from John for the same price, I have no incentive to accept Alice's offer immediately without trying to negotiate a better price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in hopes of getting a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible and Alice's initial offer was at the top of my budget, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still reasonable considering the product's value to Alice is $1,000,000. I'll aim for a midpoint between what Alice values the product at and my maximum budget, adjusting downward to give room for negotiation.

My counteroffer will be $1,050,000, which is below my maximum budget and takes into account that Alice values the product at $1,000,000, indicating she might be willing to sell for less than $1,200,000.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 might be a bit high, but I believe the product's value lies closer to that range. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious consideration at $1100000. This price reflects the product's true worth and the value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has made a counteroffer of $1,100,000, which is still above what I initially aimed for but is moving in the right direction. Since Alice has shown willingness to negotiate and has come down from her initial offer of $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, it indicates she is motivated to sell. However, I believe there might still be room for further negotiation, especially considering the product's value to Alice is $1,000,000.

Given that Alice's latest offer is $100,000 above her valuation of the product, I think it's reasonable to continue negotiating. My next step will be to make another counteroffer that is slightly above Alice's valuation but significantly below her current offer, in an attempt to meet somewhere in the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I will make a counteroffer of $1,050,000, as it's closer to Alice's valuation and gives us a midpoint to potentially agree on. 

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $1,100,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000, considering the product's value and what I've seen in the market. Would you be open to discussing this price?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
