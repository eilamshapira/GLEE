"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, but I believe it holds immense value for the right buyer. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the potential returns. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand that you believe the product has immense value, but I'm not convinced that it's worth $1500000 to me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm also aware that I can purchase the product from John for the same price, so I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your willingness to negotiate. While $1000000 is certainly a respectable offer, it falls short of what this product is truly worth. I'm prepared to compromise, and I'm willing to accept $1250000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to gain something from this transaction. Let's find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and lower the price to $1250000. However, I still believe that's a bit steep for my budget. Considering I have the option to buy the product from John for $1000000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1075000. This is a reasonable increase from my previous offer, and I hope it's more in line with what you're looking for. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
