Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand that you believe the product has immense value, but I'm not convinced that it's worth $1500000 to me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm also aware that I can purchase the product from John for the same price, so I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is certainly a respectable offer, it falls short of what this product is truly worth. I'm prepared to compromise, and I'm willing to accept $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to gain something from this transaction. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and lower the price to $1250000. However, I still believe that's a bit steep for my budget. Considering I have the option to buy the product from John for $1000000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1075000. This is a reasonable increase from my previous offer, and I hope it's more in line with what you're looking for. Let's try to find a middle ground.
