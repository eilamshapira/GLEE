"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, but I believe it holds immense value for the right buyer.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your willingness to negotiate. While $1000000 is certainly a respectable offer, it falls short of what this product is truly worth. I'm prepared to compromise, and I'm willing to accept $1250000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to gain something from this transaction. Let's find common ground.

This is a reasonable increase from my previous offer, and I hope it's more in line with what you're looking for. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1075000}"
