"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer, considering the product is worth $10,000 to Bob and I can always fall back on John's $8,000 offer.

{""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","I will reject Bob's offer of $7,000 as it's below even my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 (and below John's guaranteed offer).

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

In my opinion, Bob's offer of $7,000 is too low, considering that I have a guaranteed offer of $8,000 from John. I'll continue negotiating with Bob in the next round with a new counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer, but still maintain a price well above my $8,000 minimum since I know the product is worth $10,000 to Bob.

{""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer of $7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and below John's guaranteed offer. At this point, since Bob has only increased his offer by a small amount ($500) and is still below my minimum, I will reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will continue negotiating with Bob in the next round with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offers have been gradually increasing but still remain below $8,000, I'll lower my price further but still maintain a good margin above my minimum, considering the product's value to Bob.

{""product_price"": 8800}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer of $8,000 is exactly the same as John's guaranteed offer. Since we still have 4 rounds remaining and Bob has shown a pattern of gradually increasing his offers, I believe there's still room to negotiate for a better price. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob has now reached the $8,000 mark, showing he's willing to meet my minimum price, I'll lower my previous offer but still maintain a reasonable premium above $8,000, as I know the product is worth $10,000 to him.

{""product_price"": 8500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer of $8,200 is better than John's guaranteed $8,000, and with only two rounds remaining after this one, it might be wise to accept this offer rather than risk losing the deal. The difference from John's offer is small ($200), but it's still better, and Bob's incremental increases suggest we might not get much higher.
