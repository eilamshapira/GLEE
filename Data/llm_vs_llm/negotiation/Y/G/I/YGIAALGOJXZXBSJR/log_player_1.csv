Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this amazing product. Given its value, I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $9500 is quite steep for this product. I'd be willing to pay $8500, which I believe is a fair price that would still give you a good profit margin. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Considering Bob's counteroffer and my minimum acceptable price, I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer.
