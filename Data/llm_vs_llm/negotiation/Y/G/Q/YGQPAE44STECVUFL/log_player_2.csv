"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","The offer from Alice is $200, which is more than the product's worth to me (no more than $150) and more than John's guaranteed price of $150. Since I can get the product for $150 from John, and that's also the maximum value of the product to me, there's no reason to accept Alice's higher offer.
