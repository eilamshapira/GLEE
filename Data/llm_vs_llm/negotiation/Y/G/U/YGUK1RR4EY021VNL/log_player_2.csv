"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Okay, here's my decision-making process and my choice:

I know the product is worth no more than $15,000 to me. Alice is offering it at $15,000. Since I don't want to pay more than $15,000, and I have the option to buy from John for $15,000, the best option is to buy from John and stop the negotiation process.

Therefore, my answer is:

```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```"
