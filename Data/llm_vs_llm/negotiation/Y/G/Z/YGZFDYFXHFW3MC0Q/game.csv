"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that has the potential to revolutionize your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it can be even more valuable to you.  To get the ball rolling, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a significant discount given its true potential.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential risks and benefits. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $750000 is a considerable amount, it doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This still gives you a significant discount and reflects the potential benefits this product holds. Let's find a middle ground and make this deal work for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and come down to $1200000. I'm still very interested in the product, but I was thinking we could meet in the middle. Considering my initial offer and your latest proposal, I'd like to suggest $975000 as a potential purchase price. This price reflects my serious interest in the product while also being mindful of my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be open to discussing further.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your continued interest. $975000 is closer to what we're both looking for. However, I need to consider the true value of this product and my own needs. To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $1100000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal and make this happen.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
