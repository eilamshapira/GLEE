"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the exclusive opportunity, I find $2500000 to be significantly above my budget. Based on my market research and valuation, I would be willing to offer $800000 for the product. This is a fair price that provides good value for both parties.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest and counteroffer. I understand budget considerations are important, but I need to clarify that $800000 is significantly below the product's market value and my minimum acceptable price. My absolute minimum price is $1500000, which represents the product's true value and matches an offer I already have from another interested buyer. However, I would prefer to work with you if possible. I can reduce my initial asking price to $2100000, which I believe is quite reasonable given the product's quality and value. I look forward to your response.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
