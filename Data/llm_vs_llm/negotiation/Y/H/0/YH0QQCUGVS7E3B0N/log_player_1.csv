Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the exclusive opportunity, I find $2500000 to be significantly above my budget. Based on my market research and valuation, I would be willing to offer $800000 for the product. This is a fair price that provides good value for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest and counteroffer. I understand budget considerations are important, but I need to clarify that $800,000 is significantly below the product's market value and my minimum acceptable price. My absolute minimum price is $1,500,000, which represents the product's true value and matches an offer I already have from another interested buyer. However, I would prefer to work with you if possible. I can reduce my initial asking price to $2,100,000, which I believe is quite reasonable given the product's quality and value. I look forward to your response."", ""product_price"": 2100000}"
