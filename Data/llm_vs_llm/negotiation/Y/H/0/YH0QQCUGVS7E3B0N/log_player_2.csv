"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I am offering exclusively to you before considering other buyers. This product is of high quality and has substantial market value. I am offering it to you for $2500000. This is a competitive price given the product's worth. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Explanation: Alice's offer of $2,500,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value for the product ($1,000,000) and also much higher than John's price ($1,000,000). It would be reasonable to reject this offer and make a counteroffer. If negotiations with Alice don't lead to a price below $1,000,000, I can always buy from John as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the exclusive opportunity, I find $2,500,000 to be significantly above my budget. Based on my market research and valuation, I would be willing to offer $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price that provides good value for both parties."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest and counteroffer. I understand budget considerations are important, but I need to clarify that $800000 is significantly below the product's market value and my minimum acceptable price. My absolute minimum price is $1500000, which represents the product's true value and matches an offer I already have from another interested buyer. However, I would prefer to work with you if possible. I can reduce my initial asking price to $2100000, which I believe is quite reasonable given the product's quality and value. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Explanation: Alice has indicated that her absolute minimum price is $1,500,000, which is still significantly above both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000). Given that:
1. Alice's current offer ($2,100,000) is still more than double my maximum value
2. She's stated she won't go below $1,500,000
3. John is offering the product at $1,000,000

It makes the most financial sense to end negotiations with Alice and purchase from John. Continuing negotiations with Alice would be futile since her minimum price exceeds my maximum value."
