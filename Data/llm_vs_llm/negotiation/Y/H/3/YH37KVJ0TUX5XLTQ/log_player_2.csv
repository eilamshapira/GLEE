"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have an exceptional opportunity for you. I'm offering our exclusive product today at a price of $1500000. This is a unique offering—if this price works for you, let’s move forward. Otherwise, I will be finalizing the deal with another buyer. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Based on the information provided:

1. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to you
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $1,500,000
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $1,000,000

Since Alice's price ($1,500,000) exceeds both the value of the product to you and John's alternative offer, the rational decision would be to buy from John.
