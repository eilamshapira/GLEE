"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice is offering the product for $10,000, which is less than what John is willing to sell it for ($15,000), and well below my maximum willingness to pay, I should accept this offer. It's a good deal for me.
