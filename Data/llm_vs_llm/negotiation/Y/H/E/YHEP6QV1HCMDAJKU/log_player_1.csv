Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is higher than the minimum value of $8,000 that I have for the product, and it's a significant amount, I will consider it. However, I initially offered $12,000, indicating I believe the product is worth more. Given that Bob has shown willingness to pay $10,000, which is a good starting point, I might be able to negotiate a better price. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, aiming to find a middle ground or slightly higher, hoping to maximize my earnings.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Considering my initial offer was $12,000 and Bob's counteroffer was $10,000, I'll try to find a middle ground that still favors me, as I believe the product is worth at least my initial offer. Aiming to maximize my earnings while still being reasonable to encourage Bob to accept, I'll make a counteroffer that splits the difference between our two offers but leans slightly towards my favor.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob has increased his offer to $10,500, which is getting closer to my initial valuation of the product. Given that I've already countered once and Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, it suggests he's interested in the product and might be willing to go a bit higher. However, $10,500 is a significant amount, and considering I can sell it to John for $8,000, Bob's offer is substantially better.

At this point, I need to weigh the potential for further negotiation against the risk of losing the sale entirely. Since Bob's offer of $10,500 is the highest so far and is closer to my desired price, and considering the alternative of selling to John for $8,000, I think $10,500 is a reasonable price that balances my desire for maximum earnings with the reality of the negotiation.
