"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think about this:
1. Alice's offer is $135
2. The product is worth no more than $150 to me
3. John's price is $150
4. I still have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Alice
5. Since Alice's cost is $100, there's room for negotiation

Alice's offer of $135 is better than John's $150, but I believe I can negotiate for a better price. Since I have multiple rounds left and know Alice's cost basis, I should try to get a lower price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's cost is $100 and her initial offer was $135, I'll try to meet somewhere in the middle. I'll offer $115, which gives Alice a reasonable profit while saving me money.

{""product_price"": 115}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze:
1. Alice came down from $135 to $130, showing willingness to negotiate
2. We still have 7 more rounds
3. My previous offer of $115 was rejected
4. The gap between our positions has narrowed ($130 vs $115)
5. $130 is still better than John's $150

Since Alice showed movement in my direction and we still have several rounds left, I'll try one more counteroffer. The negotiation is progressing favorably.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down $5 from her initial offer, I'll move up $5 from my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a good deal.

{""product_price"": 120}"
