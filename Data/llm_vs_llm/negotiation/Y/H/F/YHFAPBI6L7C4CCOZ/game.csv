"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $11500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth, and it allows you to gain significant value from the purchase as well.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, given that the product is worth $10000 to you, I'm willing to pay $10500. This price reflects a fair value for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to consider the true value of this product. While it's worth $10000 to me, I know its market value is higher. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer to $11000. This still gives you a good margin considering the product is worth $12000 to you. This represents a fair compromise where we both benefit from the transaction.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $10750. We're getting closer to an agreement. Given that this product is worth $12000 to you, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10875. This is a very reasonable price that gives you significant value while also respecting the product's worth to me. I hope we can close this deal and both walk away satisfied.",10875.0,Alice,5,
