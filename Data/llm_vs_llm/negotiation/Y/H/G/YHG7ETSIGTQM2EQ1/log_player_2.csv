"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Alice's offer: $1,100,000
2. John's price: $1,200,000
3. My maximum value: $1,200,000

Alice's offer is $100,000 less than John's price and it's within my maximum value. Since my goal is to save money while getting the product, I should accept Alice's offer as it gives me the best deal available.
