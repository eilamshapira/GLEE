"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1900000 is significantly above my budget. I can offer $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice, but $1750000 is still well above what I can justify spending. I could increase my offer to $1100000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. This represents the real value I see in this product. Would you consider this price?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your revised offer. However, I still believe the value of the product warrants a higher price. How about I meet you halfway at $1600000? I think this is closer to its market value and could be a beneficial investment for you. Let me know your thoughts!",1600000.0,Alice,5,
