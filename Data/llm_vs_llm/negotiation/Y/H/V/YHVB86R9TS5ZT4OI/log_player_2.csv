"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to present you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe could be highly valuable for you. I'm offering it at a price of $1900000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,200,000, and it's also higher than John's price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer. If we can't reach a reasonable agreement, I can always buy from John at $1,200,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your response! While I understand your budget constraints, my product has significant worth. How about I offer it to you for $1750000? I believe this could still be a great deal for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,750,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000). While she has reduced the price, it's still not competitive. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, as there's still room for negotiation. If we can't reach a reasonable price, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice, but $1,750,000 is still well above what I can justify spending. I could increase my offer to $1,100,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. This represents the real value I see in this product. Would you consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your revised offer. However, I still believe the value of the product warrants a higher price. How about I meet you halfway at $1600000? I think this is closer to its market value and could be a beneficial investment for you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, it's clear that Alice's valuation of the product is significantly higher than mine. Even after several rounds of negotiation, her latest offer of $1,600,000 is still well above both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000). Since Alice seems unlikely to come down to a price below John's offer, the most rational decision is to buy from John at $1,200,000. This guarantees I get the product at my maximum acceptable price without further negotiation time."
