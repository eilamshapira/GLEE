Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to set a price that is high enough to maximize my profit, but not so high that Bob would reject the offer. Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, and my reservation price is $800,000, I should aim for a price that gives Bob enough incentive to accept while capturing most of the surplus.

If I set the price too close to $1,200,000, Bob might reject it. If Bob rejects, I'll only get $800,000 from John. I should offer a price that makes Bob feel he's getting some value while maximizing my return.

A reasonable approach would be to set the price at $1,000,000. This gives Bob a $200,000 surplus (since it's worth $1,200,000 to him) while giving me a $200,000 premium over my reservation price. This seems like a fair split of the $400,000 total surplus.
