"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: $1,000,000
2. Buy from John: $1,200,000

The product is worth up to $1,200,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is $200,000 less than what John is offering. Since Alice's offer is both below my maximum value and lower than the alternative option, it makes financial sense to accept Alice's offer.
