"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is above my maximum budget. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves me room to negotiate further if needed while staying well below my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, given your interest in the product, I'm willing to lower my offer. How about $1600000? This price reflects the product's high quality and value while considering your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{

Alice is coming down, but the price is still above what I'm willing to pay. I'll counter-offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, $1,400,000 is the highest I can go.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

This offer shows Alice I'm serious while staying below my maximum and leaving a small amount of wiggle room."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I really want to make this deal happen, so I'm willing to lower my offer to $1450000. This is a great value for the product, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice is getting closer, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter-offer once more to try to secure a slightly better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting close.  How about we split the difference and call it a deal at $1,425,000?"",
""product_price"": 1425000
}
```

This counteroffer shows Alice I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price below her last offer.  It's getting close to a point where I might accept her previous offer to avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
