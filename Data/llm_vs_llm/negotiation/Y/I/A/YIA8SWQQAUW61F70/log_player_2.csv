"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it to you for $11500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to consider if Alice's offer is reasonable given that the product is worth at most $10,000 to me, and I can always buy it from John for $10,000.

Alice is offering the product for $11,500, which is $1,500 more than what I value it at and also $1,500 more than John's price. There's no reason for me to accept this offer since I have a guaranteed option to buy it for less.

In this case, I should either reject and negotiate with Alice if I think I can get a better price than John's, or just buy from John directly. Since John's price matches my maximum valuation, and Alice's initial offer is significantly higher, the most sensible choice is:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}"
