"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me right now.  Would you be willing to consider $600000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $600000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $1050000, which is still a competitive price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
