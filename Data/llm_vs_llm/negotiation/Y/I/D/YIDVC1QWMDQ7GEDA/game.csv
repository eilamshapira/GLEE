"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12500?  I believe this price still represents a great value for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
