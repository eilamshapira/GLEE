"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product for $12000. I know it's a significant investment, but I believe you'll find it incredibly valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $8,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering it for $12,000
3. John is offering the same product for $8,000

Since:
- Alice's offer ($12,000) is higher than the product's worth to me ($8,000)
- John's offer ($8,000) matches exactly what the product is worth to me
- I can save $4,000 by buying from John
- There's no reason to pay more than what the product is worth to me

The logical choice is to buy from John.
