"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I believe you'll find valuable. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Looking at the situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $150
2. I value the product at no more than $100
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $100

Since Alice's price ($150) is higher than my maximum valuation ($100) and higher than John's price ($100), it makes financial sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John instead.
