# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to offer you this product at a competitive price. I believe it will be a great fit for your needs.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Since Alice's starting price is my maximum budget, there's room for negotiation to try and get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see what happens."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your concern about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll get. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:

While $13,500 is better, I'm willing to see if I can negotiate a little further down. There's still some buffer between this offer and John's price."
