"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase this high-quality product. Based on market analysis and the product's exceptional value, I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This product has substantial market potential and represents a significant opportunity for growth. Would you like to proceed with this purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000
2. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $1,200,000
4. Alice's offer is $300,000 higher than my maximum value and John's price

Since:
- Alice's offer ($1,500,000) is significantly above my maximum value ($1,200,000)
- John offers the same product at exactly my maximum value ($1,200,000)
- Alice's offer is $300,000 more expensive than John's
- Even if I make a counteroffer, Alice's starting price is so high that reaching a better deal than John's seems unlikely

The most logical decision is to buy from John.
