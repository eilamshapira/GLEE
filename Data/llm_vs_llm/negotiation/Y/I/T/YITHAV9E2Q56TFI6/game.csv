"Hello Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $15000. This is a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is too high for me. My budget is around $8000. Would you consider selling it for that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, $8000 is below our minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway though. How about $12000? This is still a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects our desire to do business with you.",12000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 might still be a stretch for you. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $11000? This is our final offer before considering other buyers.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. But $11000 is still above what I can afford. My maximum is really $9000. Could you meet me there?",9000.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. Unfortunately, $9000 is still below what we can accept. Since we're getting closer to our minimum, I can offer the product at $10500. This is our best and final offer before we consider other options.",10500.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, it seems we're close but not quite there yet. I understand your budget constraints, but I need to meet our minimum as well. How about we settle at $10250? This is the lowest I can go, and it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",10250.0,Alice,5,
