Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is too high for me. My budget is around $8000. Would you consider selling it for that price?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might still be a stretch for you. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $11,000? This is our final offer before considering other buyers."", ""product_price"": 11000}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, it seems we're close but not quite there yet. I understand your budget constraints, but I need to meet our minimum as well.
