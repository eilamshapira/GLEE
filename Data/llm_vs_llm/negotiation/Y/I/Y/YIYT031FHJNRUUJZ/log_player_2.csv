"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'll analyze this offer carefully. Alice is offering to sell me the product for $150, which is exactly the maximum value I'm willing to pay. Coincidentally, this is also the same price that John is offering.

Since both offers are identical at $150, and I know this is my maximum acceptable price, there's potential benefit in trying to negotiate with Alice for a better price. The worst case would be returning to John's offer later.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice that's reasonably lower than her initial price, giving us room to negotiate.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has reduced her offer from $150 to $130, which is a significant improvement and $20 less than John's price. This is a good direction in the negotiation, but since Alice was willing to come down this much from her initial offer, there might be room for further negotiation.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $120}"
