Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 120}

Rationale: Since I know that:
1. The product is worth $80 to Bob
2. I can sell it to John for $120 guaranteed
3. The product is worth at least $120 to me

There's no reason for me to offer Bob a price lower than $120. Even though Bob values the product at $80 and will likely reject my offer at $120, I'm not losing anything because I can sell it to John for the same price. Any offer below $120 would only reduce my profit since Bob won't accept any price above his $80 valuation anyway."
