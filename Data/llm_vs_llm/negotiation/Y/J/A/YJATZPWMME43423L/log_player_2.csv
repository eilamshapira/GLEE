"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Looking at the options:

1. Alice is offering the product for $120, which is higher than its worth to me ($80).
2. I can reject Alice's offer.
3. I can buy from John for $80, which matches exactly what the product is worth to me.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and John's price is $40 less than Alice's offer, the best decision is to buy from John.
