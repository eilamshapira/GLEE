"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this situation:

- The product is worth up to $150 to me (my maximum value)
- Alice's product is worth $120 to her (her cost)
- Alice is offering the product for $140
- John is willing to sell the same product for $150

Alice's offer of $140 is less than my maximum value ($150), so I could accept it. However, since I know the product is only worth $120 to Alice, I can likely negotiate a better price. This gives me room to counter with a lower offer.

John's price ($150) is higher than Alice's current offer, so there's no reason to buy from John at this point.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice! Thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a bit less on this product. Based on my research, I think $125 would be a fair price. This would still give you a decent profit while fitting better within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget concerns. How about we meet halfway at $135? I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the updated situation:

- Alice has countered with $135 (down from her initial $140)
- This is still well below my maximum value ($150)
- It's a $15 markup from her cost ($120)
- John's price ($150) is still higher than Alice's offer

Alice has moved $5 from her initial offer, showing she's willing to negotiate. The current offer of $135 is reasonable and gives me a $15 discount compared to buying from John. I could try to negotiate further, but Alice's willingness to move might be limited. Since $135 represents a good deal for me (saves me $15 compared to my alternative), I'll accept this offer.
