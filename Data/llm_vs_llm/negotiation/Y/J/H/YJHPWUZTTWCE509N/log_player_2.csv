"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer compared to my other options. Alice is offering the product for $12,000, but it's only worth $10,000 to me at most. If I accept this offer, I'd be paying $2,000 more than the product's value to me.

John is offering the same product for $10,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since Alice's offer exceeds my valuation and is higher than John's alternative offer, I'll decline Alice's offer and go with the guaranteed option.
