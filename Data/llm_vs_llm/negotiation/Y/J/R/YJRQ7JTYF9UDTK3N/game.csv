"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a fair offer.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to get a fair price for the product. Let's try to find a middle ground.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $180 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle, but I can't go any higher than $150. If you're open to that, let's close this deal.  If not, I'm going to have to look at other options.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to my limit, but I still think we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $160 for the product. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer. I'm still not comfortable with $160.  How about we split the difference and go with $155? This feels like a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize this deal.",155.0,Bob,6,
