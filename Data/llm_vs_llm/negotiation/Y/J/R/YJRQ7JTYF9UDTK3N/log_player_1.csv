"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to get a fair price for the product. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $180 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle, but I can't go any higher than $150. If you're open to that, let's close this deal.  If not, I'm going to have to look at other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer, as $150 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I believe I can get a better deal. I'll try to meet Bob closer to the middle of our previous offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to my limit, but I still think we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $160 for the product. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're getting closer. I'm still not comfortable with $160.  How about we split the difference and go with $155? This feels like a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

$155 is a reasonable price, and I've been negotiating for several rounds. Considering my minimum acceptable price is $120, accepting $155 seems like a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by pushing for a higher price."
