"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep, but I believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $10500 for it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9500.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid to $9500. I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, but I still need to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my last offer and your new offer. Let's try $10000.",10000.0,Alice,5,
