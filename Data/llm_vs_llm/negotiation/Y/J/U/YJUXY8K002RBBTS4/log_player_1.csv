"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us, but is closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $10,500 for it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9500.  Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer, trying to meet Bob halfway between my last offer and his new offer. Since he's willing to go up to $9,500, I'll try to find a compromise that's closer to my target but still reasonable for him. 

(I'll send a new counteroffer in the next round)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid to $9,500. I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, but I still need to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my last offer and your new offer. Let's try $10,000."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $10000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $9750.  If you're willing to accept that, we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $9,750 is getting very close to my target, and considering we're halfway through the negotiation rounds, I think it's a reasonable price to accept. It's higher than the $8,000 I could get from John, and I've had a good negotiation process with Bob. Accepting this offer seems like the best choice at this point."
