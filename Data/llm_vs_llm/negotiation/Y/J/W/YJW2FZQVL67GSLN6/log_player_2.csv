"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering an exclusive, high-quality product at a price of $1200000. I'd love to know if you're interested in this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's price ($1,200,000), and this is just the first round of negotiation, it would be wise to reject this offer and make a counteroffer. There's potential to get a better deal from Alice through negotiation, while John's price will always be available as a fallback option.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower to leave room for negotiation while still being reasonable.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, your price matches what I can get elsewhere. To make this deal worthwhile for me, I would be willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This would give you an immediate sale without having to look for other buyers."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for considering the offer. Given the value and rarity of this product, I'm setting the price at $1100000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, and I hope we can close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced the price by $100,000 from her initial offer, which shows she's willing to negotiate. Since $1,100,000 is $100,000 less than both the initial offer and John's price, this is a meaningful improvement. However, since she came down significantly from her first offer, there might still be room for further negotiation. Let's reject and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down $100,000 from her initial offer to $1,100,000, I'll raise my previous offer of $900,000, but still try to get a better deal than her current offer.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. You've shown flexibility, and I'd like to meet you partway. I can offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and would allow us to close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
