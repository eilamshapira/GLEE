"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $12000 is above my budget for this product. I should mention that I can get the same product from John for $10000. Since the product is worth $10000 to you as well, I'd like to offer $9000. This gives you a reasonable profit while allowing me to save compared to my alternative option. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
