"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product here that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to analyze this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $12,000, but it's worth at most $10,000 to me, and I know I can buy it from John for $10,000.

Since Alice's offer exceeds both my maximum valuation and John's alternative price, it doesn't make sense to accept it.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $12,000 is above my budget for this product. I should mention that I can get the same product from John for $10,000. Since the product is worth $10,000 to you as well, I'd like to offer $9,000. This gives you a reasonable profit while allowing me to save compared to my alternative option. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
