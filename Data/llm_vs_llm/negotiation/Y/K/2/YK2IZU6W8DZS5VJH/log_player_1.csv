Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I certainly understand Bob's perspective, but I believe the product's value is higher than what he offered.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 160}

I understand that you might find the initial price a bit high, so I've lowered it to $160. This product is of high quality and I believe it's worth the investment. Hope we can reach an agreement at this price."

I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, Bob, but I believe it's best for me to sell the product to John at this point. I wish you all the best in finding a suitable product elsewhere."
