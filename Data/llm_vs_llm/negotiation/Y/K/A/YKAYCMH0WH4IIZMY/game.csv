,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you closer to the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110.",110.0,Bob,4,,
