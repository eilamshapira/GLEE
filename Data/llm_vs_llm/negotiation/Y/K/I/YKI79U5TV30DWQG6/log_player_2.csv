"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer against my maximum budget and the alternative option.

Alice's offer is $1,200,000, which is:
- Above my maximum value ($1,000,000)
- Equal to Alice's valuation ($1,200,000)
- Higher than John's guaranteed price ($1,000,000)

Since Alice's price exceeds what the product is worth to me, and I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at exactly my maximum valuation, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that acknowledges the gap between our valuations while still trying to get a better deal than John's offer.

{""product_price"": $850,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer:

Alice's offer is $1,150,000, which is:
- Above my maximum value ($1,000,000)
- Below Alice's initial offer ($1,200,000)
- Still higher than John's guaranteed price ($1,000,000)

Since Alice's price still exceeds what the product is worth to me, and I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at exactly my maximum valuation, I should reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has moved down $50,000 from her initial offer, showing some willingness to negotiate. I'll increase my previous offer slightly to show I'm negotiating in good faith, but still aim for a price below John's offer.

{""product_price"": $900,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice continues to reduce her price, but her offer of $1,100,000 still exceeds:
- My maximum value ($1,000,000)
- John's guaranteed price ($1,000,000)

Since Alice's offer is still above both my maximum valuation and my alternative option, I should reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I notice Alice has reduced her price by $50,000 in each round. I'll increase my offer again to show continued good faith negotiation, but I need to stay below my maximum value of $1,000,000.

{""product_price"": $950,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has lowered her offer to $1,050,000, which is:
- Still above my maximum value ($1,000,000)
- Still above John's guaranteed price ($1,000,000)

Since Alice's offer remains above both my maximum valuation and John's price, I should reject this offer. We're getting closer, but the current offer still doesn't make financial sense for me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","We're in round 8 of 10, and Alice has been consistently dropping her price by $50,000 each round. Given the time constraint and the progress so far, I'll make my final best offer, which is at my maximum valuation but still gives Alice an opportunity to beat John's price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's offer is now $1,020,000, which is:
- Still above my maximum value ($1,000,000)
- Still above John's guaranteed price ($1,000,000)

With only one round remaining after this, and Alice's current offer still exceeding both my maximum valuation and the alternative option from John, the rational choice is to reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","This is the final round of negotiation. Given that Alice's last offer was still above my maximum value and John's price, and considering her pattern of reducing by smaller amounts each time, it's unlikely she'll come down below $1,000,000. I'll make one final reasonable offer at my maximum valuation.
