Hi Bob! I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. How about we start with an offer of $250?,250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $250 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate you're interested! How about we meet in the middle? I could offer it to you for $200.",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for trying to meet in the middle, but $200 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer, how about $60? I think that's a fair price for the product.",60.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand, Bob. $60 is a bit too low for me. How about $180? That's my final offer.",180.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $180 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and your last offer, so how about $120?",120.0,Bob,6,
