Send your offer to Bob.,"Based on the information I have, I'll make an initial offer to Bob. I know the product is worth at least $80 to me, and I have the option to sell to John for $80 as a guaranteed backup.

I'll start with a somewhat higher price to leave room for negotiation while aiming for a good profit.
