"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to make a decision based on the prices offered and the value of the product to me.

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me.
Alice is offering to sell it for $20,000.
John is offering to sell it for $12,000.

Since Alice's price ($20,000) is higher than both the product's value to me ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000), the logical choice is to buy from John.
