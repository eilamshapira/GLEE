Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price to offer Bob for the product.

The product is worth $12,000 to Bob (his maximum valuation).
The product is worth at least $12,000 to me.
If Bob rejects my offer, I can sell it to John for $12,000.

Since I already have a guaranteed fallback option of $12,000 from John, there's no reason for me to offer Bob a price lower than $12,000. And since Bob values the product at exactly $12,000, offering anything higher would lead to rejection.

Therefore, the optimal offer is $12,000, which is exactly what the product is worth to Bob.
