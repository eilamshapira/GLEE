"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Looking at your options:

1) Alice's offer: $12,000
2) Reject Alice's offer
3) Buy from John for $12,000

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to you. Alice is offering it at $12,000, which is the maximum value you'd place on it. John is also selling it at $12,000.

Since the price is identical between Alice and John, and all options lead to you paying $12,000, there's no financial advantage to choosing one seller over another. In this case, you might as well accept Alice's offer since she made the initial approach.
