"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: Pay $100
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John: Pay $120

Since:
- The product is worth no more than $120 to me
- Alice's offer ($100) is less than John's price ($120)
- Alice's offer ($100) is below my maximum value ($120)

The best decision is to accept Alice's offer at $100, as it will save me $20 compared to buying from John, and it's within my acceptable price range.
