"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a slightly lower price.  Would you be interested in purchasing it for $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Reason: The offer price of $85 is higher than my maximum budget of $80. I can buy the same product from John for $80, so I will reject Alice's offer."
