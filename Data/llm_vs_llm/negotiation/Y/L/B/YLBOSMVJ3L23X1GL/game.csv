"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, I am considering my budgetary constraints. I would be willing to purchase the product for $800000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 falls significantly short of my valuation for this product. It wouldn't be fair to me to accept such a low price.  However, I'm willing to be flexible to make this deal work. Could you consider $1100000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my constraints and the alternative options available to me, I can raise my offer to $900000. I believe this reflects a fair middle ground. Let me know if this would be acceptable to you.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I see we are getting closer.  To be frank, accepting anything under $1000000 would be difficult for me. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations, and I want you to feel confident in your investment as well.  How about we settle at $1000000 even? This demonstrates my commitment to finding common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
