Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm sure you'll find our asking price of $1,250,000 quite reasonable."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**New Offer to Bob:**

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. While I appreciate your offer, I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit too low for us. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle and set the price at $1,100,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, given your evaluation, I'm willing to lower our asking price to $1,100,000. This reflects a significant reduction from our initial offer and, I believe, meets you halfway. Please consider this new proposal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Explanation:**

You are asking Bob to pay $100,000 more then he thinks the product is worth. If Bob accepts the offer you will get $100,000 more then you can get from selling to John. Bob may reject your offer which is fine since you know you can get your asking price of $1,200,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $980000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than the price you can get from John. It's better to sell to John since you can get a higher price and there is no uncertainty about the sale. It's unlikely that Bob will buy the product for a price higher then $1,000,000 which is the price he values the product."
