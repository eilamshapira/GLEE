"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: Alice's offer of $150 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $80. It's also notably higher than John's guaranteed price of $80. Since I have the option to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price with Alice, I'll reject this initial high offer. If negotiations don't progress favorably, I can always fall back on John's offer of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 70}

Reasoning: I'll start with a counteroffer of $70, which is below my maximum value of $80 and John's price. This gives me room to negotiate upward if necessary. Since Alice's initial offer was very high at $150, I'm starting low to try to meet somewhere in the middle, but still keeping my offer reasonable given that I know the product is worth $150 to Alice. If Alice rejects this offer, I can gradually increase my price in subsequent rounds while still maintaining the option to go to John's $80 offer as a backup."
