"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product that I believe will bring immense value to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to let it go for a price that I think is fair and reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer was $1,100,000 and I want to save as much money as possible, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower. Considering the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, I'll aim for a price that is closer to that value but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value more accurately."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad we can continue the discussion. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a price that's closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to meet you halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to her is $800,000. I'll reject this offer and try to bring the price down further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's latest offer was $1,050,000 and she mentioned meeting me halfway, I'll try to meet her halfway from my previous counteroffer of $900,000. A midpoint between $900,000 and $1,050,000 would be $975,000. However, I want to try to bring the price down further, so I'll offer a bit less than that.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and our previous discussions."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I'm glad we're making progress in our negotiation. I'm willing to make another adjustment to the price, but I still believe the product's value warrants a higher price point. I'm thinking of a price that's slightly above your current offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,020,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. However, I notice that she's slowly coming down from her initial offer, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to try to reach a mutually beneficial price. Since she mentioned that the price is slightly above my current offer of $950,000, I'll try to split the difference between her new offer and my previous one.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To split the difference between Alice's new offer of $1,020,000 and my previous offer of $950,000, I'll calculate the midpoint: ($1,020,000 + $950,000) / 2 = $985,000. However, since I'm trying to bring the price down, I'll offer a bit less than that.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. I appreciate the progress we're making. Considering your latest offer and my previous one, I'd like to propose a price of $980,000.

Alice's offer:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like, but we're getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with. Considering that the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, I'm willing to continue negotiating to try to reach a price that's closer to that value. However, I also need to keep in mind that I have a limited number of rounds left and that buying from John is still an option.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's latest offer was $1,000,000, and I'm trying to bring the price down, I'll try to meet her halfway between her offer and the product's value to her, which is $800,000. A midpoint between $1,000,000 and $800,000 would be $900,000. However, I've already offered $950,000 and $980,000 in previous rounds, so I'll try to offer a price that's slightly higher than the midpoint, but still lower than my previous offers.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product, but I need to feel confident that the price is fair. Considering our previous discussions, I'd like to propose a price of $990,000, and then revisit the $980,000 I previously offered, but then also consider $985,000 and then $982,500 and then $990,000 - $7,500 = $982,500.
