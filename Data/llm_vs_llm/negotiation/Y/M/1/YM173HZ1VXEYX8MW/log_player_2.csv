"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and Alice's initial offer is $1,500,000, which is much higher than my maximum budget, I will reject Alice's offer. I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is reasonable and closer to my maximum budget. Since I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, I'll make an offer that is significantly lower, but still shows that I'm interested in buying the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,400,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $800,000. While it's a slight improvement from her initial offer, it's still not a price I'm willing to pay.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and consider making another counteroffer. However, I'll also keep in mind that I have the option to buy the product from John for $800,000, which is my maximum budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer that is still within my budget, but slightly higher than my previous offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and compromise, but still not willing to exceed my maximum budget.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,300,000 is still significantly higher than my maximum budget of $800,000. While she's gradually decreasing the price, it's not coming down quickly enough to meet my budget.

At this point, I'm starting to think that Alice may not be willing to sell the product to me at a price I'm comfortable with. Given that I have the option to buy the product from John for $800,000, which is my maximum budget, I'm inclined to explore that option further.
