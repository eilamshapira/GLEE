Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 25000}

I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while still maintaining the potential for a good profit. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob and that's my minimum acceptable price (as I can sell it to John for that amount), starting high gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $12,000 because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 (which I can get from John). Since Bob has shown interest but offered below my minimum, I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round, lowering my initial price but still keeping it above $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 19000}

I'm lowering my price significantly from my initial offer of $25,000 to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but still maintaining a price well above my minimum of $15,000. Since Bob's previous offer was $12,000, this new offer of $19,000 signals that while I'm willing to come down in price, I won't go below a certain threshold. This leaves room for further negotiation while ensuring I can still make a good profit if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll take John's guaranteed offer of $15,000. Bob's latest offer of $14,000 is still below what I can get from John, and given the pattern of negotiation (Bob's increments are relatively small, moving from $12,000 to only $14,000), it seems unlikely that Bob will exceed or even match John's offer of $15,000 in subsequent rounds. It's more prudent to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John rather than continue negotiating with Bob for a potentially lower amount."
