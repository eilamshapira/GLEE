# Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(Let's start negotiating, Alice's initial offer is way too high and way above my budget.)
Counteroffer: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I'm looking to spend no more than $600,000. Would you be willing to sell the product for this price?"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.
