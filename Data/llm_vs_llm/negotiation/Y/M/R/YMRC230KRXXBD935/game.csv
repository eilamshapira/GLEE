"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product available that could potentially add great value to your portfolio. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1500000. Let me know if you're interested!",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand budget constraints can be a challenge. However, the product's value is substantial, and $800000 doesn't quite reflect that. I can offer a more competitive price of $1350000. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1350000 is still above my limit.  I'm willing to go up to $950000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
