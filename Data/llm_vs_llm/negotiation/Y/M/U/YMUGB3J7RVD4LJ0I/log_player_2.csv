"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11000. It's a great deal and worth every penny! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer of $11,000 is above my budget of $10,000, I will reject the offer. I'd like to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's initial offer, but still shows that I'm interested in the product.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I think the product is great, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know if that's something you'd be open to."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's new offer of $10,000 is exactly at my budget, and I also have the option to buy the product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in continuing to negotiate with Alice. I might as well just accept Alice's offer or buy from John. However, since I've already invested time in negotiating with Alice, I'll accept her offer.
