"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to analyze the options to maximize my savings.

Alice's offer: $11,500
John's offer: $12,000
Product worth to me: up to $12,000

Alice's offer saves me $500 compared to John's price. Since the product is worth up to $12,000 to me, and Alice's price is below that threshold, accepting her offer is the most economical choice.
