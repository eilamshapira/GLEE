"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to consider my options carefully. Alice's offer is $150, which is the maximum price I would pay for the product, but it's not a good deal for me. I could get the same product from John for $120, which would save me $30. Given that I have the option to make a counteroffer to Alice, I should try negotiating for a better price before potentially falling back to John's offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's below John's price but still might be acceptable to Alice.
