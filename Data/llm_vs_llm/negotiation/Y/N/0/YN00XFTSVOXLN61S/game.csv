"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I have to be honest that $150 is significantly above what I'm looking to spend. I've seen similar products for much less, and I actually have another seller offering it for $80. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can offer $60 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without the hassle of finding another buyer.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your honest feedback and for making an offer. I understand that $150 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product has a higher value than $60. Considering your mention of a similar product for $80, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product for $120, which is a significant discount from my initial price. This price reflects the product's quality and uniqueness.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice. However, $120 is still well above what I can justify spending, especially since I can purchase the same product from another seller for $80. That said, I value establishing a business relationship with you and would prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer $70, which is slightly below the alternative I have, but would give you a sale today rather than losing the business entirely.",70.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to establish a business relationship and your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. You mentioned that you can purchase the product from another seller for $80, and I'm willing to consider that as a benchmark. I can offer the product to you for $90, which is slightly above the alternative you have, but I believe the value I can provide, including any potential future business, justifies this price. I'm trying to meet you in the middle while also ensuring I get a fair price for the product.",90.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for coming down to $90, Alice. I can see we're getting closer to an agreement. However, I need to be transparent that the product is only worth $80 to me at most, which is exactly the price John is offering. While I'd prefer to do business with you, I can't justify paying more than the product's value to me. I can offer $75, which gives you a quick sale today and saves me a bit compared to my alternative option. If this doesn't work for you, I understand, but I'll need to go with John's offer.",75.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your transparency about the product's value to you. I understand that you have an alternative option at $80, and I'm willing to consider that. Given that you've expressed a preference to do business with me, I'm willing to make a concession. I can offer the product to you for $85, which is slightly above your maximum value but still below my initial price. This price reflects a compromise, taking into account your needs and my own requirements. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can establish a positive business relationship.",85.0,Alice,7,
