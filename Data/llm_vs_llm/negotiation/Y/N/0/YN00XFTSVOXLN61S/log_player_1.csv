"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I have to be honest that $150 is significantly above what I'm looking to spend. I've seen similar products for much less, and I actually have another seller offering it for $80. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can offer $60 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without the hassle of finding another buyer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $60 because it's significantly lower than my initial offer and below my minimum acceptable price. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price. I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your honest feedback and for making an offer. I understand that $150 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product has a higher value than $60. Considering your mention of a similar product for $80, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product for $120, which is a significant discount from my initial price. This price reflects the product's quality and uniqueness."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice. However, $120 is still well above what I can justify spending, especially since I can purchase the same product from another seller for $80. That said, I value establishing a business relationship with you and would prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer $70, which is slightly below the alternative I have, but would give you a sale today rather than losing the business entirely. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $70 because it's still below my acceptable price range. Although Bob is willing to establish a business relationship, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Since Bob mentioned an alternative price of $80, I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer that takes into account Bob's alternative option."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to establish a business relationship and your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. You mentioned that you can purchase the product from another seller for $80, and I'm willing to consider that as a benchmark. I can offer the product to you for $90, which is slightly above the alternative you have, but I believe the value I can provide, including any potential future business, justifies this price. I'm trying to meet you in the middle while also ensuring I get a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for coming down to $90, Alice. I can see we're getting closer to an agreement. However, I need to be transparent that the product is only worth $80 to me at most, which is exactly the price John is offering. While I'd prefer to do business with you, I can't justify paying more than the product's value to me. I can offer $75, which gives you a quick sale today and saves me a bit compared to my alternative option. If this doesn't work for you, I understand, but I'll need to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $75 because it's still below the price I'm willing to accept. Although Bob is trying to justify his offer by mentioning the alternative price of $80, I believe I can get a better deal. Since Bob mentioned that the product is only worth $80 to him, I'll try to meet him at that price in the next round, as it's closer to my target and ensures I don't lose the sale to John, who is offering $100, a price I know I can get if the negotiation with Bob doesn't succeed."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your transparency about the product's value to you. I understand that you have an alternative option at $80, and I'm willing to consider that. Given that you've expressed a preference to do business with me, I'm willing to make a concession. I can offer the product to you for $85, which is slightly above your maximum value but still below my initial price. This price reflects a compromise, taking into account your needs and my own requirements. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can establish a positive business relationship."", ""product_price"": 85}"
