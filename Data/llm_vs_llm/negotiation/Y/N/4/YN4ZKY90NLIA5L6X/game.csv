"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product but $25000 is way out of my budget. I'm looking to spend no more than $12000 and would like to start the negotiation at $6000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
"Bob, your offer is much too low. I appreciate your interest, but the product is valued far more highly. I'm prepared to entertain a counteroffer more in line with its true worth.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget concerns, but this is a premium product with a value well above your initial bid. To meet partway, I'm willing to lower my price to $14000. Let me know if that works for you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
