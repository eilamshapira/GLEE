"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1400000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'd be happy to purchase it for $1000000. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $1000000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to offer it to you for $1300000, which is still a competitive price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1300000 is closer, I'm still a bit stretched.  I'm willing to go up to $1150000. This is my final offer. ",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price. However, considering the product's value, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'd like to make one more compromise. I'd be willing to sell the product to you for $1250000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1250000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is the price I'm comfortable with. Let me know if you are willing to accept this.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
