"Hello Bob, I hope you're doing well. I'd like to offer you a product that I believe would be a valuable asset for you. This product has been thoroughly vetted and has substantial worth in the market. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. I look forward to your response.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your proposal, I've been comparing prices in the market and I believe $1200000 is on the higher end for this product. I have another offer from John for exactly the same price, so there's no advantage for me to accept your current offer. I would be interested in purchasing the product from you, but I'm looking for a better value. Would you consider $900000? This would make your offer more attractive than my alternative option and allow us to close this deal quickly.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for the best value, but I should clarify something - I don't believe John is offering you an identical product, as I haven't made this specific product available to other sellers. My product has unique qualities and proven value that justify its price point. That said, I'm willing to work with you on the price. I can offer it for $1050000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of what you're getting. This is considerably more advantageous than alternatives when you consider the quality and specifics of this particular product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
