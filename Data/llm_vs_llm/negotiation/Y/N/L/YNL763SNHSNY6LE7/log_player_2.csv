"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I hope you're doing well. I'd like to offer you a product that I believe would be a valuable asset for you. This product has been thoroughly vetted and has substantial worth in the market. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Looking at Alice's offer, she is proposing to sell the product for $1,200,000. This is exactly the same price that John is offering, and it's also the maximum amount the product is worth to me.

Since Alice's price doesn't provide any savings compared to John's offer, and I won't get a better deal by accepting it immediately, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. This gives me a chance to negotiate a lower price with Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your proposal, I've been comparing prices in the market and I believe $1,200,000 is on the higher end for this product. I have another offer from John for exactly the same price, so there's no advantage for me to accept your current offer. I would be interested in purchasing the product from you, but I'm looking for a better value. Would you consider $900,000? This would make your offer more attractive than my alternative option and allow us to close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for the best value, but I should clarify something - I don't believe John is offering you an identical product, as I haven't made this specific product available to other sellers. My product has unique qualities and proven value that justify its price point. That said, I'm willing to work with you on the price. I can offer it for $1050000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of what you're getting. This is considerably more advantageous than alternatives when you consider the quality and specifics of this particular product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer to $1,050,000, which is $150,000 less than both her original price and John's price. This represents a 12.5% discount from the maximum amount I'm willing to pay.

While I could potentially negotiate further, Alice has already made a substantial concession, and the current offer provides me with a meaningful savings compared to my alternative option with John. Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and this offer already accomplishes that, I'll accept Alice's offer.
