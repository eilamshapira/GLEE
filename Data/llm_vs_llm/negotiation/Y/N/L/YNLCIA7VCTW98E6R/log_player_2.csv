"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited you're interested in the product! It's truly a valuable item. I'm offering it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer ($140) is higher than both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100), it wouldn't make sense to accept it. While I could buy from John immediately, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first to potentially get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's below my maximum value but leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $140 is quite high for this product. I know similar products are available for much less. I can offer you $80 for it."", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but the product's quality and features justify a higher price. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's new offer ($120) is still above both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100), it's still not acceptable. However, Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing the price significantly. I'll continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has moved down from $140 to $120, showing willingness to negotiate. I'll increase my previous offer but still stay below my maximum value and John's price.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I can actually get this product elsewhere for $100. To make it worth buying from you, I would need a better price. I can offer $90."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have other options. This product truly offers unique value that you won't find elsewhere. I'm willing to go down to $110. This is the lowest I can go while still making it worthwhile for me. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's offer ($110) is still above John's price ($100), and since the product is worth exactly $100 to me, there's no reason to pay more than that. At this point, since Alice is insisting on staying above $100 and stating this is her lowest offer, it makes more sense to buy from John rather than continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}"
