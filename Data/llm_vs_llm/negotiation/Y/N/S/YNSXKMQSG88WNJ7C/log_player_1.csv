Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1,150,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","I'll analyze this situation:

- The product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me
- Bob values it at $1,200,000
- Bob has offered $1,075,000
- John will buy it for $1,000,000

Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is better than John's guarantee of $1,000,000, but I believe there's room to negotiate a higher price with Bob since the product is worth $1,200,000 to him. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","I'll analyze this situation:

- The product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me
- Bob values it at $1,200,000
- Bob has offered $1,100,000, which is $25,000 higher than his previous offer
- John will buy it for $1,000,000

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly better than John's guarantee of $1,000,000. Though I could try to negotiate further, Bob seems willing to make reasonable concessions, and we're now at a price point that represents a fair split of the surplus value between us. Bob gets $100,000 in value (the difference between his valuation and the price), and I get $100,000 above my minimum acceptable value.

I'll accept this offer.
