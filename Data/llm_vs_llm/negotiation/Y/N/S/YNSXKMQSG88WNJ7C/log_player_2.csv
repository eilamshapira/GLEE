"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is less than my maximum budget of $1,200,000, I am willing to consider it. However, I also believe that Alice's minimum price of $1,000,000 leaves room for negotiation. Therefore, I will reject Alice's initial offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of getting a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable considering her minimum price. Since Alice's minimum price is $1,000,000, I'll aim for a midpoint between that and her initial offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has lowered her price to $1,125,000, which is a better offer than before. However, I still believe I can get a better deal. Since Alice has already come down by $25,000 from her initial offer, and then another $25,000 from her second offer, I think she may be willing to negotiate further.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, trying to meet somewhere in the middle between Alice's last offer and her minimum price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's last offer was $1,125,000, and her minimum price is $1,000,000, I'll aim for a price that's slightly higher than the midpoint between these two numbers. The midpoint would be $1,062,500, so I'll add a bit to that to make a reasonable counteroffer.
