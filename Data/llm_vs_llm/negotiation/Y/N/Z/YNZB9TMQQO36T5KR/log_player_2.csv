"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Looking at the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer at $950,000
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John for $800,000

Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and John is offering it at exactly $800,000, Alice's offer of $950,000 is clearly not a good deal. I would be paying $150,000 more than the product's worth to me.

The most rational choice is to buy from John at the fair value.
