,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, that's a great starting point but a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in this product but I'm capped at $800000. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob! However, $800000 is significantly below the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1400000? I believe it's a fair price considering the unique benefits it offers.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a valuable product, but $1400000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000 to make this deal happen.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints. However, I can't sell the product for $1000000. How about we settle on $1250000? I think this could be a win-win for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm very interested in this product, but $1250000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000.  If we can agree on this, we can close the deal.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued interest, Bob! While I understand your position, $1100000 is still below my acceptable range. How about we try $1200000? I believe this is a fair compromise and will make the deal happen.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but I'm stuck at my maximum budget. I'm willing to go up to $1150000, but that's my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'm going to have to explore other options.",1150000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I can see you're really committed to this deal, which I appreciate! However, I can't go lower than $1175000. This price reflects the product's value while still being close to your budget. Let me know if this works for you!",1175000.0,Alice,9,
