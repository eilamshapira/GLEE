"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers and propose $775000. I believe this is a fair price that considers both our positions.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. However, I need to insist on a slightly higher price to ensure that this deal makes sense for me as well. Let's settle for $820000. This price is quite close to your last offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",820000.0,Alice,5,
