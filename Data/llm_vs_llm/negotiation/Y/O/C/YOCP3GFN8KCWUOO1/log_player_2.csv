"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer of $15,000 is higher than my maximum valuation of $10,000, and John is offering the product for $10,000, it makes economic sense to buy from John.
