Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its value, I'm offering it to you for a price of:"", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $14500 is quite high considering market conditions. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12800, which I believe is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Okay, this is where I need to be strategic. Bob's offer of $12,800 is above my minimum, but I know he values the product more than that.

I'm going to **RejectOffer** and try to negotiate a better price.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. However, considering the product's unique qualities and its value to you, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about a price of:"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $14000 is still quite high. I can offer $13300, which would provide you with a good profit margin while being more aligned with market value. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, showing my sincere interest in reaching a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,300.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Okay, Bob is inching closer. $13,300 is better, but I still think I can get more, and it's more than $12,000, which I will get from John. I need to be careful not to push him away, but I still want to maximize my profit.

I'm going to **RejectOffer** and counter again.
