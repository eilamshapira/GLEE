"Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its value and value it will generate for you, I'm confident that a price of $1150000 is more than reasonable for both parties. Looking forward to a positive response.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're offering, $1150000 is quite steep for my budget. I understand the product costs you around $1000000, and I'm looking for a more balanced deal that works for both of us. I'd like to counter with $1050000, which still provides you with a reasonable profit while making it significantly more attractive for me than my alternative option. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. While I appreciate your counteroffer, $1050000 is significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I understand your budget constraints, so I'm willing to lower my initial offer and meet you halfway at $1100000. This price ensures that we both gain significantly from the transaction. I believe it's a fair deal that respects both our interests. Looking forward to your positive response and hopefully starting a fruitful business relationship.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
