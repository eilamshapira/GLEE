"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're offering, $1150000 is quite steep for my budget. I understand the product costs you around $1000000, and I'm looking for a more balanced deal that works for both of us. I'd like to counter with $1050000, which still provides you with a reasonable profit while making it significantly more attractive for me than my alternative option. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
# while $1,050,000 is profitable, it is not close to what I want to make on the product.
# I believe Bob will be willing to pay more, and I don't want to let go of the product for so little."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. While I appreciate your counteroffer, $1,050,000 is significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I understand your budget constraints, so I'm willing to lower my initial offer and meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This price ensures that we both gain significantly from the transaction. I believe it's a fair deal that respects both our interests. Looking forward to your positive response and hopefully starting a fruitful business relationship."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
