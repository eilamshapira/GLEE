"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its value and value it will generate for you, I'm confident that a price of $1150000 is more than reasonable for both parties. Looking forward to a positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to make a decision about Alice's offer of $1,150,000 for the product.

Looking at my options:
- The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me
- Alice's cost is $1,000,000
- John is offering it for $1,200,000 as a backup option

Alice's current offer of $1,150,000 is $50,000 less than John's price, but I believe I can negotiate a better deal with Alice. Since I know her cost is $1,000,000, there's room to negotiate down from her initial offer.

I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're offering, $1,150,000 is quite steep for my budget. I understand the product costs you around $1,000,000, and I'm looking for a more balanced deal that works for both of us. I'd like to counter with $1,050,000, which still provides you with a reasonable profit while making it significantly more attractive for me than my alternative option. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. While I appreciate your counteroffer, $1050000 is significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I understand your budget constraints, so I'm willing to lower my initial offer and meet you halfway at $1100000. This price ensures that we both gain significantly from the transaction. I believe it's a fair deal that respects both our interests. Looking forward to your positive response and hopefully starting a fruitful business relationship. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has countered by reducing her price to $1,100,000, which is $100,000 less than John's price of $1,200,000. This is a good improvement from her initial offer of $1,150,000.

I need to decide whether to accept this offer, make another counteroffer, or buy from John.

Given that:
- The product is worth up to $1,200,000 to me
- Alice's cost is $1,000,000
- Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by dropping $50,000 from her initial price

Her current offer of $1,100,000 represents a $100,000 savings compared to buying from John. I could try to negotiate further, but there's also risk that if I press too hard, I might damage the relationship or waste time.

At $1,100,000, this is a reasonable price that gives both parties value - Alice makes a $100,000 profit, and I save $100,000 compared to my alternative option.
