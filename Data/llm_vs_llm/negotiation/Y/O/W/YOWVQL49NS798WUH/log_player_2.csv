"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer my premium product at $200. Let me know if that's acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'll analyze the situation:
1. The product is worth $80 to me (my maximum value)
2. Alice's offer of $200 is way above my maximum value
3. John is offering the product at $80, which matches my maximum value
4. Alice's initial offer is more than double what John is asking

Since Alice's price is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's alternative offer, there's no reason to accept it. While I could make a counteroffer, given the large gap between Alice's initial offer ($200) and my maximum value ($80), it might be more efficient to simply take John's guaranteed offer.
