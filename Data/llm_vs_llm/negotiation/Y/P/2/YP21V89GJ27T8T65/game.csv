"Thank you Alice, but I think the product is only worth $700000 to me. How about you sell it to me for that price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you see the value in the product, but I'm afraid $700000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. How about we meet in the middle, but a bit closer to my initial offer, considering the product's unique value?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I believe the product's value is still lower than your current offer. Let's meet in the middle, but this time closer to my previous offer. How about we settle for $900000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet in the middle. Your offer of $900000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I still believe the product's value exceeds that. I'm willing to make another concession, hoping we can finalize the sale. How about $1050000? This is as low as I'm comfortable going, considering the product's unique qualities and value.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
