Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you Alice, but I think the product is only worth $700000 to me. How about you sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. Since he's interested in the product but thinks it's worth $700,000, I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my initial offer, but still closer to my initial offer to maximize my earnings.

My counteroffer: $1,200,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still believe in the product's high value."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I believe the product's value is still lower than your current offer. Let's meet in the middle, but this time closer to my previous offer. How about we settle for $900000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since he's willing to increase his offer to $900,000, it shows he's serious about purchasing the product. I'll try to slightly decrease my price to encourage a sale, but I still want to earn a premium for the product.

My counteroffer: $1,050,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still reflecting the product's high value to me."
