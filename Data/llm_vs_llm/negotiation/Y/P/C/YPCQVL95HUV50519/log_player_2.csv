# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer this to you. Given its value, the price is: 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
