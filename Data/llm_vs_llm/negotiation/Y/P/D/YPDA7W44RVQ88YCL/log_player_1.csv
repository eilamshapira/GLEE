Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm offering a higher price to Bob knowing that I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $12,000. Since the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, he will likely reject this offer as it's significantly above his valuation. This is fine because I can then sell to John for $12,000, which is actually better than selling to Bob at any price he would accept (since he won't pay more than $10,000). This way, I ensure I get the maximum value possible ($12,000) from selling the product."
