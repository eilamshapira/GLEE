"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $2300000 is significantly above my budget. I value the product, but I can't justify that price. My maximum budget is $1200000, considering I have an alternative option. I'm willing to offer $900000. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand you value the product highly. However, $1900000 is still well above my budget. I am willing to increase my offer slightly, but I'm also aware of my alternative option to buy a similar product for $1200000. I can offer $1100000. This is my best offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
