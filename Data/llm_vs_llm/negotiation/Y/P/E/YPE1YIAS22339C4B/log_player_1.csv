Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make an offer to Bob that maximizes my profit, keeping in mind that I have an alternative buyer (John) willing to pay $1,500,000.

Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, he won't accept any offer above this amount. However, I need to get at least $1,500,000 for the product (my minimum acceptable value).

Given these constraints, Bob won't be able to meet my minimum price requirements, so my best option is to make an offer that acknowledges this reality while maintaining a professional relationship.

{""message"": ""Bob, I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. After careful consideration of market conditions and the product's value, I'm offering it at $1,500,000. I understand this might be higher than your initial valuation, but this represents the minimum value I can accept based on other market opportunities. I wanted to give you the first opportunity to consider this offer before finalizing arrangements with other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
