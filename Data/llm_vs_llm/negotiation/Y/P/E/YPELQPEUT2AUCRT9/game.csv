"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, the price is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1200000 for the product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your perspective on the price. While $2300000 represents my initial assessment of the product's value, I'm willing to be flexible to find a solution that works for both of us. Would you consider $1900000? I believe this reflects a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1900000 is still a bit high for me. I can stretch my budget to $1300000. Is that something you might consider?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on finding a suitable price.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1600000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the true value of the product.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
