"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2500000. This product has tremendous potential and represents a significant opportunity. What do you think?",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but my budget is more limited. I can offer $800000 for it. Let me know if we can work something out.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $800000 is significantly below the product's market value. The product has proven performance and substantial ROI potential. I can come down to $2100000, which represents a $400000 reduction from my initial offer. This is quite competitive considering the product's capabilities and value proposition.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, I need to work within my budget constraints. How about $900000 for the product? I believe this could be a fair compromise given the other options available to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but we're still quite far apart on price. I need to consider that I have another buyer, John, willing to pay $1500000 for this product. Given that solid alternative, I can offer you the product for $1800000, which is still a significant reduction from my initial price and represents excellent value given the product's capabilities and market position. This offer acknowledges your budget concerns while respecting the product's true worth.",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand the presence of another buyer, but I also have to make the best financial decision for my situation. I'm willing to stretch a bit further and offer $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering alternative options available to me.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $1200000, which shows you're serious about this transaction. However, I must point out that I already have John willing to pay $1500000 for the product. At this point, I'm willing to offer you a slightly better deal at $1600000, which is $900000 less than my initial offer. This represents significant value and acknowledges our ongoing negotiation, while still respecting that I have a solid alternative offer. If we can't find middle ground closer to my reserve price, I'll need to proceed with John's offer.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
