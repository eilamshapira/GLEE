Round 5

# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but we're still quite far apart on price. I need to consider that I have another buyer, John, willing to pay $1500000 for this product. Given that solid alternative, I can offer you the product for $1800000, which is still a significant reduction from my initial price and represents excellent value given the product's capabilities and market position.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $1200000, which shows you're serious about this transaction.

This represents significant value and acknowledges our ongoing negotiation, while still respecting that I have a solid alternative offer.
