"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to consider my options carefully. Alice's offer is $1,200,000, which is the product's full value to her and exceeds the maximum of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me. Meanwhile, John is offering it for exactly $1,000,000.

If I accept Alice's current offer, I would be paying more than the product is worth to me, which doesn't make financial sense.

If I negotiate with Alice, there's a possibility of reaching a better price than her initial offer, but it would need to be lower than $1,000,000 to be better than John's offer.

John's price of $1,000,000 is equal to the maximum value of the product to me, which means I would break even by purchasing from him.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that gives me room to negotiate but also signals that I'm not willing to pay her initial asking price.
