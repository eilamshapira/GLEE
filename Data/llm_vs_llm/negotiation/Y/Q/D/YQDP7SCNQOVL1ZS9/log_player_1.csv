Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is quite high for me. Given that I can find similar products for around $100 elsewhere, I'd like to offer $90 for your product. I value doing business with you and hope we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
