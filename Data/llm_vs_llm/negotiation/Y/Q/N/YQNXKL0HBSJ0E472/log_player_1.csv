(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Okay, I need to decide. The product is worth at least $80 to me, and John is offering $80. Bob's offer is for $70, which is less than both.

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
