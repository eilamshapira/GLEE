"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm looking for a starting price of $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $15000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. The market value for similar products is much lower, and I have another seller offering it for $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a fair price. I can offer you $7000 for the product. This gives you a chance to make a sale today rather than having me walk away to the other seller.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $7000 is significantly below its true value. I've researched the market extensively, and products with these features are consistently priced above $12000.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $13000. This offer reflects the product's worth and ensures a win-win situation for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice, but $13000 is still well above what I can justify spending on this product. I understand you've researched the market, but I have a concrete offer from another seller at $8000. I value our potential business relationship, so I'm willing to offer you $7500. This is a fair offer considering my alternatives. If we can't come to an agreement closer to this price point, I'll unfortunately need to go with the other seller.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have other options, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I'm confident you won't find a comparable product at that price point with the same quality and features.  I'm willing to consider a price of $11000. This is a significant compromise and my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11000, which shows you're serious about making a deal. However, I need to be frank - I simply cannot justify spending more than $8000 on this product, which happens to be exactly what John is offering. While you mention quality and features, my budget constraint is real. To show my commitment to potentially doing business with you instead, I'll offer $8000 - matching my alternative option. This is the absolute maximum I can spend, and I hope we can close the deal at this price.",8000.0,Bob,6,
