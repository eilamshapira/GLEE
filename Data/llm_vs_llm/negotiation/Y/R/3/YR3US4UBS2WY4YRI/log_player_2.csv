"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer is the same as John's price ($1,200,000), and knowing that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, it makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer. There's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice, while I still have John's offer as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1050000}

I'm offering $1,050,000, which is a reasonable counteroffer because:
1. It's $50,000 above Alice's cost ($1,000,000), giving her a modest profit
2. It's significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer and John's price ($1,200,000)
3. It leaves room for further negotiation if needed
4. It would save me $150,000 compared to buying from John
5. It's a fair starting point that shows I'm serious about making a deal while also looking for a better price"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer of $1,100,000 because:
1. It's a significant reduction from the initial offer and John's price ($100,000 less)
2. It's a reasonable compromise between my counteroffer ($1,050,000) and her initial price ($1,200,000)
3. While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice might increase her price again or end negotiations
4. It gives Alice a reasonable profit ($100,000) while still giving me a good deal
5. Further negotiation might not yield significantly better results and could risk losing this favorable offer"
