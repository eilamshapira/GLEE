"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking for something a tad more budget-friendly. How about I take it off your hands for $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13500, which is still a great price considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,
