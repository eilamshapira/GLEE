"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I've done my research and I believe it's worth a premium price. I'm willing to let it go for $110, which is a great deal considering its value.",110.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to counter with $90. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not quite comfortable with $90. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. I can let the product go for $100, which is a fair price considering its value.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $100 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $95? I think that's a fair compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I still think the product is worth more than $95. How about we meet at $97.50? I think that's a fair price considering the value you'll be getting from the product.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I'm almost there, but can we meet at $96? I think that's a reasonable final offer from my side.",96.0,Bob,6,
