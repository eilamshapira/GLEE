Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll send my initial offer to Bob.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","I'll consider my options. Bob's offer of $100 is higher than the minimum value of $80 to me, and also higher than John's standing offer of $80. This seems like a good deal, especially since there's no guarantee Bob will increase his offer in subsequent rounds.
