,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1450000 is simply too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. This price reflects its value to me, and allows for a good profit margin for you as well. Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest. However, given the product's significance, I can't go down to $1000000. Considering the value it brings to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1100000.  This price represents a fair compromise and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your continued interest. I understand your position, but I believe the value is higher than $1100000. Given that, I am willing to go down to $1150000. This is my final offer, and I believe it is a fair price for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
