"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for Round 1:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm delighted to be offering you this incredible product. Given its exceptional value, I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1,450,000."", ""product_price"": 1450000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but $1450000 is simply too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. This price reflects its value to me, and allows for a good profit margin for you as well. Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","This is a tricky situation. Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I was hoping for. However, it's still above my minimum price.

Here's my analysis:

*   **Profit:** Accepting Bob's offer yields a profit of $1,000,000 - $800,000 = $200,000.
*   **Risk of Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer further, or the deal falling through entirely.
*   **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to John guarantees $800,000, which is a loss compared to Bob's offer.

Considering all of this, I will reject the offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob for Round 3:

{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest. However, given the product's significance, I can't go down to $1,000,000. Considering the value it brings to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1100000.  This price represents a fair compromise and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Okay, Bob is inching up his offer, but it's still below my counteroffer.

Here's my updated analysis:

*   **Profit:** Accepting Bob's offer now yields a profit of $1,100,000 - $800,000 = $300,000.
*   **Risk of Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate still carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer, or the deal falling through. It is worth remembering that I still have more rounds to negotiate.
*   **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to John guarantees $800,000.

I believe there is still room for improvement with Bob's offer, considering the product is worth $1,500,000 to him. I will reject his offer and try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer to Bob for Round 5:

{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for your continued interest. I understand your position, but I believe the value is higher than $1,100,000. Given that, I am willing to go down to $1,150,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
