"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer at $100
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John at $80

Since:
- The product is worth no more than $80 to me (Bob)
- John is offering the product at $80
- Alice is offering the product at $100

The logical choice would be to buy from John at $80, as it:
- Saves me $20 compared to Alice's offer
- Matches my maximum valuation of the product
- Is the most economically beneficial option
