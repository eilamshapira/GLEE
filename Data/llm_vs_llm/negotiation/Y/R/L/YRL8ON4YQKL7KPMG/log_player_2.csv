"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $12,000
2. Jhon is willing to sell it for $15,000
3. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me
4. My goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible

Alice's offer of $12,000 is $3,000 less than Jhon's price and less than the maximum value to me. This is a good offer, and there's no guarantee I could negotiate it significantly lower. Since my goal is to save money, and this offer already saves me $3,000 compared to buying from Jhon, I should accept it.
