Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{
  ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe you'd be very interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for a price of $1,200,000."",
  ""product_price"": 1200000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, your asking price is quite high and matches what I can get elsewhere. I'd like to explore a more competitive price. Would you consider $800000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Okay, considering my options and the value of the product to me is $800,000, I will evaluate Bob's offer.

Here's my decision:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```"
