"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe you'd be very interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for a price of $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's price ($1,200,000), and this is also my maximum valuation of the product, I should try to negotiate with Alice to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a significantly lower initial counteroffer to leave room for negotiation, but with a polite and reasonable message.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, your asking price is quite high and matches what I can get elsewhere. I'd like to explore a more competitive price. Would you consider $800,000 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
