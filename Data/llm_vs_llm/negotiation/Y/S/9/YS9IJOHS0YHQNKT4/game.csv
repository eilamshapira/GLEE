"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given the market considerations and my budget constraints, I'm prepared to offer $1100000. I believe this is a fair starting point that reflects both the product's value and my position. Let's see if we can work this out.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1100000 is too low for me to consider. Considering the product's potential and my own investment, I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I can't go that low. I'll offer it to you for $1700000. This is my best price, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value we both see in the product.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
