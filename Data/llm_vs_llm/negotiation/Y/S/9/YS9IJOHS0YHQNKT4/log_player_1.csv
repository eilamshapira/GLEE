"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the product. Given its unique value and the opportunity this presents, I'm offering it to you for $1,800,000. This is a significant investment, but I believe it reflects the true worth and potential of what I'm offering."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given the market considerations and my budget constraints, I'm prepared to offer $1100000. I believe this is a fair starting point that reflects both the product's value and my position. Let's see if we can work this out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is a tough situation. Bob's offer is significantly below what I need. However, I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000. I'm going to try one more round with Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is too low for me to consider. Considering the product's potential and my own investment, I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I can't go that low. I'll offer it to you for $1,700,000. This is my best price, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value we both see in the product."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
