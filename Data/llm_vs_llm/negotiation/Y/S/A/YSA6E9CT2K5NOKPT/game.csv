"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling me this product, but I've done my research and $2500000 is significantly above market value. I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $1500000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1250000 for the product, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still providing you with a sale. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, my minimum price is significantly higher. Considering the product's unique qualities, I can lower the price to $2300000. I'm confident that even at this price, the product will be a valuable asset for you.",2300000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice, but $2300000 is still significantly above what I'm prepared to pay. As I mentioned, I have John's offer at $1500000, which is my maximum budget for this product. I understand you believe the product has unique qualities, but I need to be practical about my spending. I can increase my offer to $1400000, which is very close to my maximum budget but would still give me a small savings compared to John's offer. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.",1400000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I need to find a price that reflects the true value of the product. Considering the time and effort I've invested in this, I can come down to $2000000. I believe this is a fair price that still offers you a significant benefit.",2000000.0,Alice,5,,

"Thanks for continuing to work with me on this, Alice. I can see you're coming down from your initial price, which I appreciate. However, $2000000 is still significantly above what makes financial sense for me. I need to be clear that I have a firm offer from John at $1500000, which is actually my absolute maximum budget for this product. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I would need to pay less than that. I can offer you $1450000, which is extremely close to my ceiling. This gives you a sale today, and gives me a small savings compared to my alternative. I really can't go any higher than this, as it wouldn't make financial sense for me.",1450000.0,Bob,6,,
