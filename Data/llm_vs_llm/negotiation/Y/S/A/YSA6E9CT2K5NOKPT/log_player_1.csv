"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to potentially offer you this unique product. Considering its value, I'm willing to sell it to you for a price of $2,500,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling me this product, but I've done my research and $2500000 is significantly above market value. I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $1500000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1250000 for the product, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still providing you with a sale. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Okay, Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum. I need to consider my options carefully. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I also need to prioritize getting a fair price. Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000. I'm only in round 2, so I have plenty of time to negotiate. I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counter_offer"": 2300000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, my minimum price is significantly higher. Considering the product's unique qualities, I can lower the price to $2,300,000. I'm confident that even at this price, the product will be a valuable asset for you."", ""product_price"": 2300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice, but $2300000 is still significantly above what I'm prepared to pay. As I mentioned, I have John's offer at $1500000, which is my maximum budget for this product. I understand you believe the product has unique qualities, but I need to be practical about my spending. I can increase my offer to $1400000, which is very close to my maximum budget but would still give me a small savings compared to John's offer. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob is still below my minimum, but closer. $1,400,000 is tempting, but I can't accept it. I also don't know how many rounds are left. Let's see if I can get closer to my target price. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer, but I'll also start moving closer to the $1.5M mark to make sure I don't lose the deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counter_offer"": 2000000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I need to find a price that reflects the true value of the product. Considering the time and effort I've invested in this, I can come down to $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that still offers you a significant benefit."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for continuing to work with me on this, Alice. I can see you're coming down from your initial price, which I appreciate. However, $2000000 is still significantly above what makes financial sense for me. I need to be clear that I have a firm offer from John at $1500000, which is actually my absolute maximum budget for this product. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I would need to pay less than that. I can offer you $1450000, which is extremely close to my ceiling. This gives you a sale today, and gives me a small savings compared to my alternative. I really can't go any higher than this, as it wouldn't make financial sense for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is a tough spot. Bob's offering $1,450,000 and is saying he won't go any higher. He is also saying that his alternative is an offer of $1,500,000. My minimum acceptable price is $1,500,000. If I reject, I risk losing the deal entirely and getting nothing, or getting Bob to say ""I'm going with John"".

It seems unlikely that I will be able to get a price above $1,500,000 since he is willing to pay that to John. I should sell to John to get $1,500,000.
