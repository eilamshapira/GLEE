"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to potentially offer you this unique product. Considering its value, I'm willing to sell it to you for a price of $2500000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to consider my options carefully. Alice's offer is $2,500,000, which is $1,000,000 more than what the product is worth to me ($1,500,000). It's also $1,000,000 more than John's offer. Since I can always buy from John for $1,500,000, I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling me this product, but I've done my research and $2,500,000 is significantly above market value. I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $1,500,000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still providing you with a sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, my minimum price is significantly higher. Considering the product's unique qualities, I can lower the price to $2300000. I'm confident that even at this price, the product will be a valuable asset for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has lowered her price to $2,300,000, which is still $800,000 more than what the product is worth to me ($1,500,000) and $800,000 more than John's offer. There's no advantage to accepting this offer, so I'll reject it and make another counteroffer.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice, but $2,300,000 is still significantly above what I'm prepared to pay. As I mentioned, I have John's offer at $1,500,000, which is my maximum budget for this product. I understand you believe the product has unique qualities, but I need to be practical about my spending. I can increase my offer to $1,400,000, which is very close to my maximum budget but would still give me a small savings compared to John's offer. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I need to find a price that reflects the true value of the product. Considering the time and effort I've invested in this, I can come down to $2000000. I believe this is a fair price that still offers you a significant benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

There's no reason for me to accept this offer when I can get the same product for less from John.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for continuing to work with me on this, Alice. I can see you're coming down from your initial price, which I appreciate. However, $2,000,000 is still significantly above what makes financial sense for me. I need to be clear that I have a firm offer from John at $1,500,000, which is actually my absolute maximum budget for this product. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I would need to pay less than that. I can offer you $1,450,000, which is extremely close to my ceiling. This gives you a sale today, and gives me a small savings compared to my alternative. I really can't go any higher than this, as it wouldn't make financial sense for me."", ""product_price"": 1450000}"
