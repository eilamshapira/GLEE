,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and lower the price, but I need to get closer to my original price. Let me know if this new offer works for you.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $160 is still above what I'm willing to spend. How about we meet in the middle? I can go up to $110. Let me know if that's acceptable to you.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short of what I'm looking for. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to make a small concession. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $115. Let me know if this works for you.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I think we're getting close to a deal. I appreciate your last offer, but I'm still a bit shy of what I'm looking for. Considering John is willing to pay $120, I'll need to get at least that much to make it worth my while to sell to you. Let's see if we can meet at $125.",125.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand where you're coming from, but $125 is still a bit more than I want to spend. Since John is offering the product for $120, I'm willing to match that price. How about $120? Let me know if that works for you.",120.0,Bob,8,
