Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll prepare an offer for Bob. Since the product is worth $120 to Bob and $80 to me, I should offer a price that gives Bob some value while maximizing my profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","I'll reject Bob's offer since it's only $10 above my minimum threshold and I believe I can negotiate a better price. The product is worth $120 to Bob, so there's still room for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 100}"
