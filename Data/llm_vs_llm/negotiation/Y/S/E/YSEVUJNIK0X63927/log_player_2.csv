"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given the information provided, I need to evaluate my options:

1. Accept Alice's offer and pay $110
2. Reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer
3. Buy from John for $120

The product is worth no more than $120 to me, but I want to save as much money as possible. Alice's cost is $80, which gives room for negotiation. John's price of $120 is my fallback option and represents the maximum I'd be willing to pay.

Since Alice's offer of $110 is already better than John's price of $120, and there's potential to negotiate an even better price (considering Alice's cost is $80), I should reject this offer and continue negotiating.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but still advantageous to me, considering Alice's cost is $80 and the product is worth up to $120 to me.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has come down from her initial offer of $110 to $100, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is a good sign, as her cost is $80, so she's still making a $20 profit. The current offer of $100 is significantly better than John's price of $120, saving me $20.

I could try another counteroffer, but there's a risk that Alice might not be willing to go much lower, and the negotiation could stall. Since $100 is a reasonable price (it's less than what I'm willing to pay and gives Alice a fair profit margin), I'll accept this offer.
