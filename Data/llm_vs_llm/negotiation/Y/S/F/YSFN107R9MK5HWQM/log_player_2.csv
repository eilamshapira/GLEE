"Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and Alice's offer is $250, which is more than twice my maximum budget, I will definitely not accept her offer.

Given that I have the option to buy the product from John for $120, which is within my budget, I don't need to consider rejecting Alice's offer and then trying to negotiate or wait for a better offer from her.

Therefore, my decision is to buy the product from John for $120.
