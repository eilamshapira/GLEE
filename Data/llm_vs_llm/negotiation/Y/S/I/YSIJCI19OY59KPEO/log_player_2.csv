Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm willing to pay up to $1,500,000, I'll offer a price that is lower than that, to leave room for further negotiation.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","In Round 2, I offered $1,000,000, which was rejected by Alice. In Round 3, Alice came back with a price of $1,900,000. To try to meet in the middle, I'll increase my offer from $1,000,000 to $1,200,000, but still keep it below my maximum budget of $1,500,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","In Round 4, I offered $1,200,000, and Alice rejected it. In Round 5, Alice offered $1,700,000. To try to narrow the gap, I'll increase my offer from $1,200,000 to $1,400,000. This is still below my maximum budget of $1,500,000, but it shows that I'm willing to compromise and move closer to Alice's price.

At this point, I have to consider that buying from John for $1,500,000 might be a better option than continuing to negotiate with Alice. However, I'll try one more time to see if I can get Alice to come down in price.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","In Round 7, Alice offered $1,600,000, which is very close to my maximum budget of $1,500,000. To try to get Alice to meet me at my target price, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous offer, but still below $1,600,000. I'll offer $1,450,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $1,400,000 and Alice's offer of $1,600,000, but still leaves some room for further negotiation if needed, and also shows that I am willing to pay a bit more to get the deal done with Alice.

At this point, I have to consider that buying from John for $1,500,000 is a better option than accepting Alice's offer. Since we are running out of negotiation rounds, I think it's time to stop negotiating with Alice and buy the product from John, who is offering it to me at a price that is within my budget.
