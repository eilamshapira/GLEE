"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","The offer of $2,300,000 from Alice is significantly higher than my maximum valuation of $800,000. It also exceeds the guaranteed alternative option from John. Since I can buy the same product from John for $800,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's much higher offer or even continue negotiating.
