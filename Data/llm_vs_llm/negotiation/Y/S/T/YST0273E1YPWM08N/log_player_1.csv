"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I need to make a strategic opening offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I have the safety net of John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I don't go below my minimum threshold.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer of $800,000 is below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000, I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still well above my minimum. I need to make progress in the negotiation while maintaining profitability.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob is now offering exactly $1,000,000, which matches John's guaranteed offer. Since both options would yield the same amount, and there's still potential to negotiate for a higher price with Bob, I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I see Bob has moved up to $1,000,000, which is promising. Since he's shown willingness to increase his offer substantially, I'll lower my asking price but still aim for a better deal than John's guaranteed $1,000,000.
