"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I reject Alice's offer of $1,800,000 because it's significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's alternative offer ($1,200,000). In fact, accepting this offer would mean a loss of at least $600,000 compared to my maximum value. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better price, but I always have the option to fall back on John's offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 800000}

I'll offer $800,000 to Alice. This is significantly lower than both John's price and my maximum value, which gives me room to negotiate upward if necessary. If Alice rejects this offer, I can gradually increase my offer in subsequent rounds while still maintaining a better price than John's $1,200,000 alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I reject Alice's offer of $1,500,000 because it's still higher than both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's alternative offer ($1,200,000). While Alice has reduced the price from her initial offer, it's still not competitive with John's price. I'll continue negotiating with another counteroffer in the next round, as there's still room for Alice to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm offering $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer of $800,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate in good faith and move towards a middle ground. This price is still below both my maximum value and John's alternative offer, giving me room to negotiate further if needed. However, it's also a substantial enough offer that Alice might seriously consider it, given that she has already shown willingness to reduce her price from $1,800,000 to $1,500,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I reject Alice's offer of $1,300,000. While Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's still above John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000. Since John's offer is a better deal and is below my maximum value, there's no reason to accept a higher price from Alice. I'll make another counteroffer, but if Alice doesn't come down further, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm offering $1,100,000, which is another increase from my previous offer of $1,000,000. This continues to show my willingness to negotiate and meet Alice partway. It's slightly below John's price of $1,200,000, which gives Alice an incentive to accept if she wants to make the sale, as she's seen my offers steadily increasing and might realize I have an alternative option at $1,200,000. If she rejects this offer, I still have the option to either negotiate further or take John's offer."
