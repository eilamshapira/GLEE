"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2000000. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm open to negotiations.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product has potential, $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $500000. What do you think?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to make an offer. However, $500000 is significantly lower than I'm willing to consider. Given the product's exceptional value, I'm willing to compromise and lower my initial price to $1800000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further negotiations.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me partway there. However, there's still a significant gap between our valuations.  To be frank, $1800000 is not a price point I'm comfortable with. Could you consider something closer to $600000?  I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial solution. However, $600000 is still below my expectations. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll lower my price to $1600000, which I believe is a significant compromise. I'm open to further discussions, but I'm getting closer to exploring other options.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're exploring other options, and I respect that.  While your latest offer is a step in the right direction, we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700000, but that's about as high as I can go.  Let me know if this works for you, as I need to start considering my alternatives seriously.",700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your candor about considering alternatives. I'm also weighing my options, and I must say that $700000 is still not sufficient for me to part with the product. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll lower my price to $1500000, which I believe is a significant compromise. If we can't meet in the middle, I may need to explore other opportunities that better align with the product's value.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this negotiation has been a long road, and I understand your position.  However, the truth is that your price expectations are far higher than what I believe the market will bear.  My final offer is $750000. Take it or leave it, as I'm very close to finalizing a deal with John.",750000.0,Bob,8,
