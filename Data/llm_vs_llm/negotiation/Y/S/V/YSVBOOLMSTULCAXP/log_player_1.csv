Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Could you consider something closer to $600000?  I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm willing to increase my offer to $700000, but that's about as high as I can go.  Let me know if this works for you, as I need to start considering my alternatives seriously.

I'm also weighing my options, and I must say that $700,000 is still not sufficient for me to part with the product.
