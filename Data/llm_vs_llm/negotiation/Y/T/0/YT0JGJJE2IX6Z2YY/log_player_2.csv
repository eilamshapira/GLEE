"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for a price of $1500000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer is the same as John's price, there's no benefit to rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John.
