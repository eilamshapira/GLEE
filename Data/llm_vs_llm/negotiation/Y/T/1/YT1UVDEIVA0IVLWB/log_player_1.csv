Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but the price you're asking is beyond my budget. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I can only go up to $1000000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as his offer of $1,000,000 is lower than my initial expectation and the product's value to me. I'll try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. 

My counteroffer: $2,000,000. This price is still below my initial offer but higher than Bob's counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate while also ensuring I get a fair price for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that my initial price may have been out of your budget, but I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'd like to propose a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, $2000000 is still quite high for me. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $1250000, which is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. Please let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Since Bob's highest offer is $1,250,000, which is lower than the $1,500,000 that John is willing to pay, it makes more sense to sell the product to John. This ensures I get a higher price for the product without having to continue negotiating with Bob."
