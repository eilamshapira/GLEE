Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a reasonable price to offer Bob. Since I know the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me (and I have John as a guaranteed buyer at this price), I should offer Bob a price higher than this.

Bob's maximum valuation is unknown to me. If I price too high, I risk Bob rejecting the offer. If I price too low, I leave money on the table. Since I have a guaranteed fallback option with John, I can afford to be somewhat aggressive in my pricing.

I'll offer Bob a price of $1,650,000, which represents a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value but might still be attractive if the product is worth more to Bob.
