"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I find the price a bit high. I'm willing to pay $65 for the product. Would you consider this price?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand you're looking for a better price, but $65 is too low for this product. The quality and value it provides are worth more. I could come down to $85, which is already below my initial offer and represents good value. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $85 is still higher than I'm looking to pay. I can increase my offer to $70. How about that?",70.0,Bob,4,
