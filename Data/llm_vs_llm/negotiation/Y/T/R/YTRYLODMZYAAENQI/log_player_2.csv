"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this valuable product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $150
2. Alice's offer is $120, which is $30 less than John's price
3. This is the first round, and I have room to negotiate for an even better price
4. Since Alice's initial offer is already good (below my maximum), but there might be room for negotiation, I should try to get an even better deal

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer of $120 is already reasonable, I should make a counteroffer that isn't too aggressive but still tries to get a better deal. I'll propose a price that's about 20% lower than her initial offer.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. Your product seems interesting, but I was hoping to spend a bit less. Would you consider selling it for $95? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $95 is a fair price, the product's value is a bit higher for me. Could we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this new situation:

1. Alice has come down from $120 to $105, which is a significant reduction
2. This is $45 less than John's price of $150
3. Alice seems reasonable and willing to negotiate, showing flexibility
4. The price is moving in a good direction
5. However, $105 is a very fair price, and pushing too hard might risk losing this good deal

Given that:
- The current offer is very reasonable
- We've already achieved a good discount from the initial price
- There's a risk of losing this good deal if we push too hard
- The price is significantly better than John's alternative
