Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this. Since the product is worth $150 to me and only $80 to Bob, I know he won't pay more than $80. However, I have John's guaranteed offer of $150. There's no reason for me to sell to Bob for less than $150, as that would mean losing money compared to selling to John.

I'll start with a high offer to Bob, knowing I can always fall back on John's offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","This is an easy decision. Bob's offer of $60 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and even below his own maximum value of $80. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, which is my minimum acceptable price, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Bob.
