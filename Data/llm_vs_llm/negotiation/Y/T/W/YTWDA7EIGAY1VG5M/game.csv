"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $200 is out of my budget. I'm ready to buy the product, but my offer is $100. I believe this is a fair starting point given my constraints. Let me know if we can work with that.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $100, but that's actually below what the product is worth to me. I understand $200 might be high for your budget, so I'm willing to come down to $175. This is still a good value considering what this product offers.",175.0,Alice,3,
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust, but $175 is still a bit beyond my budget. How about we settle at $140? That fits my budget and hopefully acknowledges the product's quality as well.",140.0,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility. I understand the value you see, but given my budget constraints and alternative options available, I'm revising my offer to $145. This is the best I can doâ€”please let me know if we can agree on this price.",145.0,Bob,4,
