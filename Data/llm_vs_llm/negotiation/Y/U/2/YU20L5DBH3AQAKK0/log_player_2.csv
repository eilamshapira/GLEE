"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional quality and the value it can bring to you, I'm confident that you'll find our price of $18000 quite reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $18,000, which is significantly above my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $12,000

Alice's offer of $18,000 is way too high compared to both my maximum value and John's alternative offer. There's no reason to accept this offer or even try to negotiate when I can get the product at my maximum acceptable price from John right away.
