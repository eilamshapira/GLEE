"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, Bob, let's get down to business. I understand you're interested in acquiring this valuable asset.

Here's my initial offer:

```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I believe this is a fair starting point considering its unique qualities and potential returns. Let me know your thoughts."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Okay, Bob's offer of $500,000 is far below its true value. I'm not willing to part with it for that price.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $500,000 is simply not feasible. This product offers significant value.

Let's try to find some middle ground. My counteroffer is:

```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial price, but I need to ensure I'm receiving adequate compensation for its worth."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob is still significantly undervaluing the product. $600,000 is not a price I can accept.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, Bob, we're clearly far apart. I'm willing to negotiate, but we need to move closer to a realistic number.

My counteroffer:

```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. This is a considerable drop from my initial offer, showing my commitment to reaching an agreement."

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Bob, we're heading towards a stalemate. I'm trying to be reasonable. This is a valuable asset.

Counteroffer:

```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

This is another significant reduction on my part. Please consider the value and potential this product offers. Let's try to get closer to a fair price."
