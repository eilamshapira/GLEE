"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. I'm thinking more in the range of $800000. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to go up to $1000000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I must consider the product's true value. Given the significant difference between my initial offer and your counteroffer, I'm willing to make a concession. I can offer the product to you for $1800000, which is still below my initial price but closer to what I believe it's worth.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
