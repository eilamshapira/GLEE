"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1400000 is a bit higher than I was anticipating. Would you consider $1100000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a price that's closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I'd like to propose a price of $1250000, which I believe is a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
