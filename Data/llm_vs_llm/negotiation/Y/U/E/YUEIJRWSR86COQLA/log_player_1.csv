Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm glad you're interested in the product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to sell it to you for a price that reflects its worth.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1400000 is a bit higher than I was anticipating. Would you consider $1100000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a price that's closer to my initial offer.
