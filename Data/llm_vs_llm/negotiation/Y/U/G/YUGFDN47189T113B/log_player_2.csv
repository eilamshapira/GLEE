"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11000. It's a great deal considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it extremely beneficial. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice is offering the product for $11,000, which is:
1. More than what it's worth to me ($10,000)
2. More than John's offer ($10,000)

The logical choice is to buy from John for $10,000. This way I save $1,000 compared to Alice's offer and get the same product.
