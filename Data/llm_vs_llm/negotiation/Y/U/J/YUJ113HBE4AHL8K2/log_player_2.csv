"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great fit for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $15000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000), there's no reason to accept this offer. While I could reject and make a counteroffer, I know that Alice values the product at $10,000, and their initial offer of $15,000 suggests they're starting with a very high price. Given these factors and that John's price matches my maximum value, it would be most rational to buy from John.
