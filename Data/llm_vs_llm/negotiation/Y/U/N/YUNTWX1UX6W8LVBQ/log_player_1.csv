Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high price to have room for negotiation while ensuring I get more than my minimum value of $150.

{""product_price"": 300}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer ($100) is below my minimum acceptable value ($150), and it's actually lower than John's guaranteed offer, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer. I still have several rounds to negotiate with Bob, and if we can't reach a better agreement, I can always sell to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial price somewhat but still maintain a price well above my minimum value to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 250}"

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob has actually lowered his offer from $100 to $90, which is moving in the wrong direction and is still well below my minimum value of $150. Since Bob seems to be negotiating in bad faith and John's offer of $150 is guaranteed, I'll take the safe option and sell to John.
