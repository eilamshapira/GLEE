"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is lower than the product's worth to me and also lower than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

My counteroffer is: $900,000

So, the response is not one of the three options you listed, but rather a counteroffer. However, to fit the format you requested:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

My counteroffer is: $850,000

So, I'll reject Bob's offer and send a new counteroffer.

Considering I only have a few rounds left, I might not be able to get a significantly better offer from Bob. Since $750,000 is close to $800,000, but still lower, I'll try to meet in the middle.

My next step is to reject Bob's offer and send a new counteroffer.
