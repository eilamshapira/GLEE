Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, Bob, I'm ready to talk business. Here's my initial offer for the product:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm prepared to offer you the product for the price of $900,000. I know its value to you, and I'm confident this is a fair price given its unique qualities."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $900000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Considering my minimum acceptable price is $800,000 and Bob's offer is below that, I must reject. I'll try for a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is too low. The true value of this product is undeniable. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $850,000?"", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800000.  This is my final offer, and if we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to look elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","This is a critical decision. Bob's final offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price. Selling to John would net me the same amount, but I've already spent time negotiating with Bob. Therefore, I will accept.
