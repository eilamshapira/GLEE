Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product's uniqueness, but I'm looking to spend no more than $8000. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I still have a better alternative with John's offer of $12,000, so I will try to negotiate a better price with Bob. 

My next offer will be:
