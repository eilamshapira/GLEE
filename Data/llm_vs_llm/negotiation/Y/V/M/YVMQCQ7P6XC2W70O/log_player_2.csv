"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is higher than our maximum budget and what John offers. We should try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We start with a significantly lower offer than Alice's, but one that is still potentially profitable for her.  This gives us room to negotiate upwards if needed while aiming for a price well below our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is moving in the right direction, but $900,000 is still closer to John's price than our initial offer.  We have time to negotiate further and see if we can get closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We split the difference between our last offer and Alice's current offer. This shows willingness to compromise but keeps us moving towards a significantly lower price."
