"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.  If he rejects, I'll adjust based on his counteroffer, always keeping in mind the $1,000,000 safety net with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer to try and bridge the gap, but I'm prepared to move on to John if Bob isn't willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway, offering a price that's still above my minimum but significantly lower than my initial offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there. I'm going to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob before I go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a price that's right in the middle between his last offer and my minimum. This shows further flexibility and a strong desire to reach an agreement, but it's still a decent price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $50,000 below my minimum, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation. It's time to cut my losses and secure the deal.  I'll accept his offer."
