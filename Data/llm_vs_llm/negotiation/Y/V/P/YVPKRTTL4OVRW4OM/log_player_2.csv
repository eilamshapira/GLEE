"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I should buy the product for as little as possible, but my absolute maximum is $15,000. Since Alice's offer is exactly $15,000, I can choose to accept it. However, I could also try to negotiate. Since I can buy the product from John for $15,000, I should definitely not pay more than that. The risk of rejecting is that Alice might not be willing to lower the price. 

Here's my reasoning:

*   **Buying from Alice at $15,000:** This guarantees I get the product, but at my maximum acceptable price.
*   **Rejecting and Counteroffering:** There's a chance Alice will accept a lower counteroffer, saving me money. However, Alice might not lower her price and I might end up paying more.
*   **Buying from John:** This guarantees the product at $15,000.

Since I can get the product for $15,000 from John if Alice doesn't accept a lower price, I'll risk a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, I want to try to get a better price. Since I can get it for $15,000 from John, and my goal is to save money, I'll make a counteroffer slightly lower than Alice's current offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Okay, Alice has lowered the price, which is good. Now, I have to decide whether to accept this lower price or try for a better one.

*   **Buying from Alice at $14,800:** This is better than my original options.
*   **Rejecting and Counteroffering:** I could try again for a lower price. However, Alice might not lower the price again, and I might end up paying more or running out of negotiation time.
*   **Buying from John:** This is still an option, but less attractive now that Alice's offer is lower.

Since the price is getting closer to what I'm willing to pay and I can get the product cheaper than buying it from John, I will reject and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, Alice has lowered the price again. I will make another counteroffer, I will lower the price more aggressively.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Okay, the price is getting closer to my target.

Here's the situation:

*   **Buying from Alice at $14,600:** This is a good deal, lower than John's price.
*   **Rejecting and Counteroffering:** Risky, as Alice might not budge further, and I could end up worse off.
*   **Buying from John:** Still an option, but less appealing with Alice's lower offer.

I could try one more round, but Alice might not lower the price again. Since the price is reasonable now, I will accept.
