You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer is $120, which is the same price as John's offer, and it's also the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, I should reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price with Alice. The product is worth $100 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $100 to Alice and $120 to me, I'll start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation. I'll offer a price that's slightly above Alice's cost but significantly below my maximum price.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has lowered her price to $115, which is better than both her initial offer and John's price ($120). However, since there's still room for negotiation (as the product is worth $100 to Alice), I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get an even better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still try to get a better deal than $115. Since Alice came down from $120 to $115, I'll show willingness to negotiate by increasing my offer from $105.
