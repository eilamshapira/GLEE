"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm offering this top-quality product at $12000—which reflects its true value. Let me know if you'd like to proceed at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer is $12,000, which is the same price as John's, and Alice seems open to negotiation, it makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer. There's potential to get a better price from Alice since the product is worth $8,000 to her.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's above Alice's cost ($8,000) but significantly below her initial asking price.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $12,000 is quite high for my budget. Given market conditions, I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This represents a fair price that would be beneficial for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. Considering the product's quality and its market value, I believe a price of $11000 reflects a fair balance for both sides. Let’s aim to close the deal at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her price by $1,000, showing she's willing to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still quite high, and we can likely get a better price since we know her cost is $8,000. Since we have several rounds left and John's offer of $12,000 remains as a backup, it's worth continuing to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still maintain room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for lowering the price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still higher than what I was hoping to pay. I can increase my offer to $10,000, which would provide you with a solid profit margin while being more aligned with my budget. Would you consider this fair price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
