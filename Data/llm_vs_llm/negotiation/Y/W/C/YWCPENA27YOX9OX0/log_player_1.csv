Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that reflects its worth. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its potential."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is the minimum value I have for the product, and selling it to John would also be for $1,000,000, I don't see a benefit in accepting Bob's offer over selling to John immediately or trying to negotiate a better price with Bob. However, given that Bob is willing to engage in negotiations and his initial valuation of the product is $1,500,000, there's potential to reach a higher price through further negotiation.

Therefore, I choose to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to find a middle ground that is more favorable to me than $1,000,000 but still attractive to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that the initial price might have been a bit steep, but I believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. However, I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest, $1100000 is the highest I can go. If that's agreeable to you, I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's latest offer of $1,100,000 is higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($1,000,000) and higher than what John is offering. Given that Bob has stated $1,100,000 is the highest he can go, further negotiation might not yield a significantly better offer. Additionally, accepting this offer allows me to conclude the sale without the risk of Bob walking away or me having to sell to John for less.

Therefore, I choose to accept Bob's offer of $1,100,000, as it represents a good compromise and ensures the sale of the product at a price above my minimum acceptable value.
