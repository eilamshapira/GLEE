"Bob, this product is truly exceptional and a rare find. Given its unique qualities and the value it brings, I'm offering it to you for $11500. I believe this is a fair price considering its lasting impact and the investment it represents.",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be a good addition to what I'm doing, but not at that price.  I could go as high as $6000, but I'd need you to come down significantly.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $6000 is far below my minimum acceptable price. This product holds significant value beyond what you're offering. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $11000. This is the lowest I can go at this moment.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little, but that's still much higher than I'm comfortable with. It seems like we have very different ideas about the value here. I could maybe stretch to $6500, but that's absolutely my limit.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we are still quite far apart, but I'm willing to continue negotiating. My absolute lowest price is $10500. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to close this deal with you. If you cannot meet me at this price, I'm afraid we won't be able to come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your lowest price, but I have to be honest, the gap between our valuations is still too large.  I'm willing to move up to $7000, but if we can't find an agreement there, I'll have to explore other options.",7000.0,Bob,6,
