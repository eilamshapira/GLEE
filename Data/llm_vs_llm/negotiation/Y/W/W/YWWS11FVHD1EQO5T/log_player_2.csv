Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $6000 is far below my minimum acceptable price. This product holds significant value beyond what you're offering. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $11000. This is the lowest I can go at this moment.
