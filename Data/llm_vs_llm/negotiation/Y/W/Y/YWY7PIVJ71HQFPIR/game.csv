"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $6000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the lowest I can go is $13000 given the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you!",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $13000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I can offer $7000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle. However, I need to maintain a minimum value for the product. I can go down to $12500, which is the lowest I can offer. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to lower the price. However, $12500 is still significantly above my budget. Given that I've already offered $7000 and you've only come down by $1500 from your original price, I'm willing to make a small increase in my offer. I can offer $7500 for the product. If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to consider other options.",7500.0,Bob,6,
