Send your offer to Bob.,"I want to start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

{""product_price"": 11,500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,500 is better than John's $10,000, and Bob likely won't go much higher given his rejection of my initial price, I'll accept his offer. This gives me a decent profit above my minimum value.
