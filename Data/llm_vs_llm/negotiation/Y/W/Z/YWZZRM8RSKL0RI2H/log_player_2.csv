"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can do better than $11,500.  While you're willing to pay up to $12,000, you should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first. There's room for both of you to find a price that's more favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $10,500, which is closer to Alice's value of $10,000. This gives Alice a reasonable profit while still saving me a significant amount compared to the initial offer and John's price."
