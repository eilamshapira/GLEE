"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to make a decision based on the offers available.

Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is exactly the maximum I'm willing to pay. 

John (mentioned as Jhon in the options) is also offering the product for $1,200,000.

Since both offers are for the same price, and my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, there's no financial advantage to choosing one seller over the other. In this case, I might as well accept Alice's offer since she's the one directly negotiating with me.
