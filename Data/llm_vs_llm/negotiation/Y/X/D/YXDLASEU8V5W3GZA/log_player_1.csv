Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was hoping to spend less on the product. How about I offer you $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to counteroffer since $10,000 is lower than my initial offer, but still higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept from John. My counteroffer will be $11,500."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend less, but I believe the product's value is higher than $10,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down in price, Alice. I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle, but I would like to go lower than that. Can we settle at $11000?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $11,500, and it's still significantly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept from John ($8,000), I think it's a good deal and I'm willing to accept it to finalize the sale."
