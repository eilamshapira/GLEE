"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a great product to offer you today. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $50 for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. The initial offer of $180 might have been too high, but $50 is far too low considering the product's value. Let me propose a more moderate price.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $50 is too low for this quality product. I can offer it to you for $150. This is a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $50 is too low for this quality product. I can offer it to you for $150. This is a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a budget in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

The offer of $100 matches John's guaranteed offer, and continuing the negotiation might risk losing both opportunities. Since Bob has come up to a fair price that meets my minimum threshold, I'll accept his offer."
