"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $12,000
2. John's price is also $12,000
3. The product is worth $12,000 to me (maximum I'm willing to pay)

Since Alice's offer is exactly $12,000, which is:
- Equal to my maximum valuation
- Equal to John's price

There's no advantage in choosing one option over another as all options will cost me $12,000. In this case, I'll accept Alice's offer since there's no economic difference.
