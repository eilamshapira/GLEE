Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product I think you'll be very interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Considering my minimum value for the product is $8,000, accepting Bob's current offer would only give me the minimum profit. I should try to get more. Therefore:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While $8,000 is a starting point, I know this product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9000 is still a bit high for me. Could we settle at $8500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","This is a tough call. I've gotten Bob to increase his offer, and $8,500 is more than my minimum. However, I could potentially squeeze out a bit more. But the risk of losing the sale altogether is increasing with each rejection. Selling to John guarantees $8,000, but I know the product could be worth more to Bob.

I'll take one more shot at negotiation, but if he doesn't budge, I'll sell to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. How about we split the difference one last time? I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,750."", ""product_price"": 8750}"
