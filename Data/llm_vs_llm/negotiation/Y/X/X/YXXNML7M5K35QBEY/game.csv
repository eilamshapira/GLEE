"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be out of your budget, but I can try to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $140. It's a great deal considering the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down, Alice.  While I appreciate the offer, $140 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $105?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",105.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm trying to be flexible, so I'll meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $122.50. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, considering the product's value.",122.5,Alice,5,
