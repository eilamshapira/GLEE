Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $80 to Bob
2. I know I can get $80 from John if Bob rejects
3. Since Bob values it at $80, he won't pay more than that
4. If I offer $80 to Bob, he would be indifferent between buying and not buying
5. Given Bob is likely to reject when indifferent, I should offer slightly less
