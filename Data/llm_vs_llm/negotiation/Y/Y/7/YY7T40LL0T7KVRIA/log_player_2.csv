"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll analyze this situation.

Alice is offering the product for $1,100,000, which is $400,000 less than John's price of $1,500,000.

The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, so Alice's offer is below my maximum value. Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, accepting Alice's offer would be the rational choice.
