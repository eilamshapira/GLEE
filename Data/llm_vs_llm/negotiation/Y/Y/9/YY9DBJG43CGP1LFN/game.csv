"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but $120 is more than I'm looking to spend on this product. After considering my budget and the product's value to me, I could pay $60 for it. Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I cannot accept $60 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. Given the quality and value of the product, I could come down to $100. Would that work for you?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $100 is still above what I can spend. I should mention that I've found the same product from another seller for $80. I'd prefer to buy from you, so I can offer $70. This would save me some money while still giving you a sale. Does that work for you?",70.0,Bob,4,
