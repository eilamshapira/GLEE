Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but $120 is more than I'm looking to spend on this product. After considering my budget and the product's value to me, I could pay $60 for it. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since $60 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80, and I'd like to try negotiating with Bob for a better price before falling back to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I cannot accept $60 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. Given the quality and value of the product, I could come down to $100. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $100 is still above what I can spend. I should mention that I've found the same product from another seller for $80. I'd prefer to buy from you, so I can offer $70. This would save me some money while still giving you a sale. Does that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob mentioned he can find the same product for $80 elsewhere and is only offering $70, which is below my minimum acceptable price, it makes more sense to take John's guaranteed offer of $80."
