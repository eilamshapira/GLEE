"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to consider the options carefully here. 

Alice is offering the product for $120, which is more than the $80 maximum I value it at. I could also buy the product from John for $80, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since I can always buy the product from John for $80, there's no reason to accept Alice's $120 offer. I should either make a counteroffer to Alice to see if I can get it for less than $80, or just buy from John.

Given that I don't know how low Alice might go, it makes sense to try negotiating first.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but $120 is more than I'm looking to spend on this product. After considering my budget and the product's value to me, I could pay $60 for it. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I cannot accept $60 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. Given the quality and value of the product, I could come down to $100. Would that work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has come down from $120 to $100, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but that's still more than the $80 maximum I value the product at. Since John is offering the product for $80, which is exactly my maximum valuation, I should either try one more counteroffer to see if Alice will go below $80, or just buy from John.

Since Alice has already reduced her price by $20, it seems she might be willing to reduce it further. I'll reject her offer and try one more counteroffer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $100 is still above what I can spend. I should mention that I've found the same product from another seller for $80. I'd prefer to buy from you, so I can offer $70. This would save me some money while still giving you a sale. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 70}"
