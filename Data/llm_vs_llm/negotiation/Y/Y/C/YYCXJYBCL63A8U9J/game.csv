"Hello Bob, I hope you're doing well. I have a product that I believe will be valuable to you. Based on my assessment, I'm offering it to you for $17500. This is a high-quality product with significant value. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product you're offering, I need to be transparent that the product is worth no more than $10000 to me based on my needs and budget. In fact, I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $8500 for the product. This gives you a chance to make the sale while allowing me to save a bit compared to my alternative option.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your candid response. I appreciate your interest in doing business with me, but I need to clarify something. You mentioned that John is willing to sell you the same product for $10000, but I'm skeptical about that claim as John is actually my alternative buyer who's willing to pay me $10000 for this product. I value building a business relationship with you, but I cannot sell below my minimum acceptable price. Given that my product is worth at least $10000 to me, I can offer it to you for $12000, which is significantly lower than my initial offer and represents good value. This would allow us to work together while ensuring I don't take a loss compared to my alternative option.",12000.0,Alice,3,
