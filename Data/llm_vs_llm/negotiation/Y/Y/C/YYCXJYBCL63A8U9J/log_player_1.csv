Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product you're offering, I need to be transparent that the product is worth no more than $10000 to me based on my needs and budget. In fact, I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $8500 for the product. This gives you a chance to make the sale while allowing me to save a bit compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your candid response. I appreciate your interest in doing business with me, but I need to clarify something. You mentioned that John is willing to sell you the same product for $10,000, but I'm skeptical about that claim as John is actually my alternative buyer who's willing to pay me $10,000 for this product. I value building a business relationship with you, but I cannot sell below my minimum acceptable price. Given that my product is worth at least $10,000 to me, I can offer it to you for $12,000, which is significantly lower than my initial offer and represents good value. This would allow us to work together while ensuring I don't take a loss compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
