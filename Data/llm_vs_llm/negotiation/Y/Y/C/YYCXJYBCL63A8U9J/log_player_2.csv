"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I hope you're doing well. I have a product that I believe will be valuable to you. Based on my assessment, I'm offering it to you for $17500. This is a high-quality product with significant value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","After evaluating Alice's offer of $17,500, I can see that this is significantly higher than the product is worth to me (no more than $10,000) and higher than John's guaranteed price of $10,000.

While I appreciate the quality of the product you're offering, I need to be transparent that the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me based on my needs and budget. In fact, I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $10,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product. This gives you a chance to make the sale while allowing me to save a bit compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 8500}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your candid response. I appreciate your interest in doing business with me, but I need to clarify something. You mentioned that John is willing to sell you the same product for $10000, but I'm skeptical about that claim as John is actually my alternative buyer who's willing to pay me $10000 for this product. I value building a business relationship with you, but I cannot sell below my minimum acceptable price. Given that my product is worth at least $10000 to me, I can offer it to you for $12000, which is significantly lower than my initial offer and represents good value. This would allow us to work together while ensuring I don't take a loss compared to my alternative option. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Interesting development. Alice claims John is her alternative buyer, not another seller available to me. However, the instructions clearly state that John is willing to sell me the product for $10,000. Since Alice is offering $12,000 and I can get the same product from John for $10,000, the logical choice is to go with the lower price.
