"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations if you have a different valuation in mind.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10000 is a serious offer, I was thinking more along the lines of $11500, considering the product's value and the fact that I can sell it to another buyer for a substantial amount. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hesitant to go above $10500.  Perhaps we can meet in the middle at $10750?  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",10750.0,Bob,4,
