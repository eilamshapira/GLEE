"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2000000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, while I appreciate the unique features of the product, the price you're asking is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is significantly below its value. Let's meet in the middle. How about $1600000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1600000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000. This is a fair compromise considering my budget constraints. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  It seems we are getting closer.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a lower price, so I need to move quickly. My final offer is $1300000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my strong desire to do business with you.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your urgency and the significant reduction in price. However, $1300000 is still above what I can justify. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which is my absolute maximum. I hope we can close the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
