"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1400000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm very interested in the product, and I believe it can be a valuable asset. How about we start at $1200000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,200,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
