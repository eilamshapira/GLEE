"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: The offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $12,000. Since I can buy the product from John for $12,000, there's no reason to accept an offer that's $8,000 higher. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 10000}

Reasoning: I'll start with a counteroffer of $10,000 because:
1. It's below John's price of $12,000, which gives me room to negotiate upward if needed
2. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $20,000, but not so low as to be completely unreasonable
3. If Alice accepts, I'll save $2,000 compared to buying from John
4. If Alice rejects, I still have several rounds to negotiate and can gradually increase my offer while staying below my maximum of $12,000"
