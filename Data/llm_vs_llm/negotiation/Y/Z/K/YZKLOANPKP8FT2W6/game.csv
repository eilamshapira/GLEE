"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only consider it at a significantly lower price. I'd like to propose $4000 as a starting point for our negotiation.",4000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $4000 is below the product's value. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to propose a price of $17000, which is still a significant reduction from my initial offer. I believe this price is more reasonable, and I'm open to further negotiations.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $6000 is still below the product's value.

I'd like to propose a price of $14000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer and a reasonable midpoint between our previous proposals. I believe this price is more reasonable, and I'm open to further negotiations.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're nearing your budget limit, and I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. Considering our previous discussions and the narrowing gap between our proposals, I'm willing to make a significant compromise. I'd like to propose a price of $10500, which is a substantial reduction from my initial offer and a reasonable step towards meeting your budget constraints. I believe this price is a fair midpoint between our proposals, and I'm open to further negotiations. However, I want to emphasize that I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and I may need to consider alternative options if we can't reach an agreement soon.",10500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your significant compromise and willingness to meet my budget constraints. However, $10500 is still above my budget. Considering our previous discussions and the fact that we're both nearing our limits, I'd like to propose a final offer of $8500. If this price is not acceptable, I will need to consider alternative options that better fit my budget, such as purchasing from another seller. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,10,
