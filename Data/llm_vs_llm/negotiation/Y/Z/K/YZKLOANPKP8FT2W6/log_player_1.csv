Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only consider it at a significantly lower price. I'd like to propose $4000 as a starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Since Bob's offer of $4,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. Selling to John for $10,000 is a better option than accepting Bob's offer, but I want to try to negotiate a better price with Bob first."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $4,000 is below the product's value.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Selling to John for $10,000 remains a better option than accepting Bob's current offer, but I want to continue negotiating with Bob to try to reach a more favorable price."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

Since Bob's offer of $7,500 is still lower than the product's value to me, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. However, I take note of Bob's hint that he may consider alternative options if we can't reach an agreement soon, which suggests that he may be nearing his maximum budget. Given this, I'll try to make a more strategic counteroffer that balances my goals with the risk of losing the deal. Selling to John for $10,000 remains a better option than accepting Bob's current offer, but I want to try to get closer to that price or better with Bob."

Round 10
Bob's offer:

Considering our previous discussions and the fact that we're both nearing our limits, I'd like to propose a final offer of $8500. If this price is not acceptable, I will need to consider alternative options that better fit my budget, such as purchasing from another seller. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.

Since Bob's final offer of $8,500 is still lower than the product's value to me, and considering that I have a better option available, I decide to sell the product to John for $10,000. This option provides a higher return than accepting Bob's offer, and I'm confident that it's the best decision given the circumstances. Rejecting Bob's offer without a counteroffer would likely end the negotiation, and I don't see a better outcome than selling to John at this point."
