"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's offer ($120) is higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80), it wouldn't make sense to accept it. I could make a counteroffer, but since John's price is already at my maximum value, and Alice's initial offer is significantly higher, it might be better to just buy from John immediately rather than risk a lengthy negotiation that might not result in a better price.
