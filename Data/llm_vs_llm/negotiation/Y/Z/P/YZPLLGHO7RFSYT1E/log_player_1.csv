"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth $1,200,000 to me and $800,000 to Bob, I'll start with a high offer while leaving some room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 1,500,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Given that Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000 (which I can get from John), and it's even below the product's value to Bob ($800,000), I will reject this offer. However, since I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, there's no reason to waste time with offers that are this low.
