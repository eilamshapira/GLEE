Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob.

Given the information, I need to decide on a price to offer Bob. I know that:
- The product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me
- I have a guaranteed fallback option (John) who will pay exactly $1,000,000
- Bob's valuation is unknown to me

Since I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, I should set my price to Bob higher than this amount. If I set it too high, Bob might reject it, but I still get my $1,000,000 from John. If I set it at a reasonable premium above my guaranteed fallback, Bob might accept it, giving me more value.

A reasonable approach would be to offer the product at a 50% premium above my guaranteed fallback price.
