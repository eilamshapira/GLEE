"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $800000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a significant discount from what I could get from another buyer, and I believe it's a fair price for a product that would be highly beneficial to your business.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. You can do better."
