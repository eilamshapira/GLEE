"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1000000 is significantly below my bottom line. I'm willing to be flexible, however. How about we meet in the middle at $1625000? This is a truly unique opportunity.",1625000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Meeting in the middle is a good idea, but I was thinking we could split the difference between my previous offer and your new price. That would put us at $1212500. I'm trying to be reasonable here, considering the product's value to me.",1212500.0,Bob,4,
