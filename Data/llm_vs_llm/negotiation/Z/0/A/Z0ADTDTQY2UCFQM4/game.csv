"Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $95. Let me know if you're interested.",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $95 is too high for me. I know similar products are available for much less. I'd be willing to pay $75 for the product. This would still give you a reasonable profit while being a fair price for me.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $75 is below my cost for this product. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make sure I'm covering my expenses. I can come down from my initial offer - how about $90? This is a quality product that will serve you well, and it's already discounted from what similar items typically sell for.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $90 is still more than I can justify spending. I should be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. Would you consider $77? This would give us both a good deal.",77.0,Bob,4,
