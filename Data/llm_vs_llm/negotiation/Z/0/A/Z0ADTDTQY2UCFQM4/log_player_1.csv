Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $95. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $95 is too high for me. I know similar products are available for much less. I'd be willing to pay $75 for the product. This would still give you a reasonable profit while being a fair price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $75 is below my cost for this product. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make sure I'm covering my expenses. I can come down from my initial offer - how about $90? This is a quality product that will serve you well, and it's already discounted from what similar items typically sell for."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $90 is still more than I can justify spending. I should be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. Would you consider $77? This would give us both a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
