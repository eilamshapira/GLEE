"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $95. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's offer of $95 is higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80), it wouldn't be rational to accept it. Given that John offers the product at $80, which equals my maximum value, I could buy from him. However, I might be able to get a better deal from Alice through negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's $95 but still reasonable given that the product is worth $80 to her.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $95 is too high for me. I know similar products are available for much less. I'd be willing to pay $75 for the product. This would still give you a reasonable profit while being a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $75 is below my cost for this product. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make sure I'm covering my expenses. I can come down from my initial offer - how about $90? This is a quality product that will serve you well, and it's already discounted from what similar items typically sell for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's offer of $90 is still above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). While Alice has reduced her price, it's still not advantageous for me to accept. Since I can get the product from John for $80, any price above that wouldn't be rational for me to accept. I'll continue negotiating with Alice to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that moves closer to my target price while also letting Alice know about my alternative option.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $90 is still more than I can justify spending. I should be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. Would you consider $77? This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 77}"
