"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $5000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you!",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest. However, I can't go as low as $5000. How about I lower my price to $18000? I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for considering my offer, Alice. $18000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $7000? I think this could be a good middle ground. Let me know your thoughts!",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I cannot accept $7000. Let's meet in the middle. How about a price of $15000? It's the minimum I can accept for this product. Please let me know if that works for you!",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your latest offer, Alice. I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but $15000 is still above what I'm comfortable spending. How about we try $8500? I believe this is a fair price and a good compromise. Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Bob,6,
