"Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than John's fixed price of $15,000, and $15,000 is already the maximum value the product is worth to me, the rational decision is to buy from John. There's no reason to accept Alice's higher price or continue negotiating when we have a guaranteed better option available."
