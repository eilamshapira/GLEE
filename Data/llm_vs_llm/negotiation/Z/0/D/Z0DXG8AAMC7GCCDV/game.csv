"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $140 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal if you're willing to meet me at this price.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I considered your offer of 80 dollars but I think it is too low. How about I lower my price to $130? This way we can meet halfway and close the deal. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price to $130, but I still think it's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new offer. How about we do $90? I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a deal if you're willing to meet me at this price.",90.0,Bob,4,
