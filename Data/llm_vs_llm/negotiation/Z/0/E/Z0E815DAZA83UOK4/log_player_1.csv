Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $60 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Okay, based on Bob's counteroffer and my priorities, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. My goal is to maximize my profit, and $60 is too low.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counter_offer"": 130}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. How about we meet in the middle at $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. However, $130 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $70? Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","This is getting tricky. Bob's offering $70 now. That's better than before, but still less than what I could get from John. I need to decide if I want to keep negotiating with Bob, or cut my losses and sell to John. Given that I value the product at $100 or more, and Bob values it at $80, there is room for negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and try one more counteroffer.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I am too. Let's try $115. That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $115 is still beyond what I'm willing to spend. I can go up to $75. If that works for you, let's make the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer is now $75. While this is more than before, it's still less than the $100 I can get from John. I've tried a couple of counteroffers, and Bob seems unwilling to pay a price that I am happy with. I'll cut my losses and sell to John.
