"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I find the price a bit high for my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $8000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your counteroffer. While I understand budget constraints, I'm afraid I cannot accept $8000 as it's significantly below the product's value. I could come down to $13500, which is already a substantial reduction from my initial offer. This product represents a considerable investment on my part, and I need to ensure I'm not selling at a loss. Please let me know if this works better for you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate the reduction, but $13500 is still above my budget. How about we settle on a price of $9000? I believe this is a fair offer considering my financial limits.",9000.0,Bob,4,
