Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your counteroffer. While I understand budget constraints, I'm afraid I cannot accept $8,000 as it's significantly below the product's value. I could come down to $13,500, which is already a substantial reduction from my initial offer. This product represents a considerable investment on my part, and I need to ensure I'm not selling at a loss. Please let me know if this works better for you."", ""product_price"": 13500}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate the reduction, but $13500 is still above my budget. How about we settle on a price of $9000? I believe this is a fair offer considering my financial limits.
