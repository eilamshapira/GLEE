"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $12,000 is lower than the minimum value of $15,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $15,000, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I am willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

My counteroffer is: $18,000

So, my decision is: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} and I'll make a counteroffer of $18,000."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $14,000 is still lower than my previous counteroffer, but closer to the minimum value that I'm willing to accept ($15,000), I need to consider my next step carefully. Given that I have the option to sell the product to John for $15,000, which is higher than Bob's current offer, I will reject Bob's offer. However, since Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I will make another counteroffer instead of selling to John immediately.

My counteroffer is: $16,000

So, my decision is: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} and I'll make a counteroffer of $16,000."
