"Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a product that I know would be valuable to you. Based on market analysis, this product is worth $15000 to someone with your needs. I'm prepared to offer it to you for $14500, which would save you $500 compared to its market value. This is a limited-time offer as I already have another buyer, John, who is interested. I'd prefer to sell it to you first if we can agree on this price, which I believe is fair for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,1,
