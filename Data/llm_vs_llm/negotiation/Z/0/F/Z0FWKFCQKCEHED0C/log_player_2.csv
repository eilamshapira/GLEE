"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a product that I know would be valuable to you. Based on market analysis, this product is worth $15000 to someone with your needs. I'm prepared to offer it to you for $14500, which would save you $500 compared to its market value. This is a limited-time offer as I already have another buyer, John, who is interested. I'd prefer to sell it to you first if we can agree on this price, which I believe is fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using negotiation tactics by:

* **Inflating the product's worth:**  While she claims it's worth $15,000, you know its true value to her is less.
* **Creating a false sense of urgency:** The mention of another buyer (John) is likely a tactic to pressure you.

You have a strong alternative: buying from John at $15,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a better price or she might accept a counter-offer closer to your desired range."
