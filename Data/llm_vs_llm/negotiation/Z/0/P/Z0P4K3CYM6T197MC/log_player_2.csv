"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to offer you a product that I'm selling. I'm offering it to you for $120. This is a fair price for the value of the product. If you're interested, please let me know, otherwise I have another buyer who is ready to purchase it at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While Alice presents a compelling case and another potential buyer, there's no harm in seeing if she'll lower the price. There's a chance to save some money if she's willing to negotiate."
