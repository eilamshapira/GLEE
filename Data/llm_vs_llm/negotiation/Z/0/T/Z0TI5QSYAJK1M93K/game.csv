"Hi Bob, I'm offering to sell you this incredible product. Based on its value and the demand, I'm asking for $25000.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $25000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $5000.  Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the feedback. I understand that price is a factor. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $20000?",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $20000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  To be honest, I was hoping we could get closer to the $6000 mark.  What do you say we try to find some middle ground there?",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $6000. The product's value is significantly higher. Let's try to find a reasonable compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $18000. This is the lowest I can go.",18000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate that you're trying to find a compromise, but to be honest, $18000 is still far outside what I'm willing to pay. If you're truly interested in making a deal, I'd need to see a price closer to $7000. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",7000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go much lower than my previous offer. I'm willing to meet you at $17000. This is my absolute final offer. If you can't accept this, I'll have to consider other options.",17000.0,Alice,7,
