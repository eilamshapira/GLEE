"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $25000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $5000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the feedback. I understand that price is a factor. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $20,000?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $20000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  To be honest, I was hoping we could get closer to the $6000 mark.  What do you say we try to find some middle ground there?

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $6,000. The product's value is significantly higher. Let's try to find a reasonable compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $18,000. This is the lowest I can go."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate that you're trying to find a compromise, but to be honest, $18000 is still far outside what I'm willing to pay. If you're truly interested in making a deal, I'd need to see a price closer to $7000. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob is being incredibly difficult, and his offers are very low. I'm not willing to go much lower than my last offer. At this point, I need to consider the $15,000 from John. I'm going to reject Bob's offer again, but I'm strongly considering selling to John.
