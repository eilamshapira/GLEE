"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering to sell you this incredible product. Based on its value and the demand, I'm asking for $25000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is way too high. It's important to bring the price down significantly before even considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $25,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $5,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By offering $5,000, I'm anchoring the negotiation much lower than Alice's initial price. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Showing Interest:** While the offer is low, I've made it clear I'm interested in the product, which might encourage Alice to counter.
* **Staying Realistic:**  I'm keeping John's $8,000 offer in mind. If negotiations drag on without significant progress, I'm prepared to walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the feedback. I understand that price is a factor. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $20000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice moved her price down, $20,000 is still far too high and doesn't represent a serious counter-offer. I need to signal that we're not even close to a deal yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $20,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  To be honest, I was hoping we could get closer to the $6,000 mark.  What do you say we try to find some middle ground there?"", 
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer, but only by a small amount to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate but not at any cost.
* **Suggesting Middle Ground:** By mentioning the $6,000 mark and ""middle ground,"" I'm encouraging Alice to make a more significant move towards a realistic price.
* **Maintaining Walk-Away Power:** I'm still well below John's $8,000 offer, giving me leverage to walk away if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $6000. The product's value is significantly higher. Let's try to find a reasonable compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $18000. This is the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but very slowly.  Her price drops are still too small, and $18,000 is far beyond my budget.  It's time to push back more firmly or consider John's offer seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate that you're trying to find a compromise, but to be honest, $18,000 is still far outside what I'm willing to pay. If you're truly interested in making a deal, I'd need to see a price closer to $7,000. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm being more direct about the price gap while still expressing a desire to make a deal.
* **Significant Increase:** The $1,000 jump from my previous offer shows Alice I'm serious but reaching my limit.
* **Introducing Alternatives:**  By mentioning ""other options,"" I'm subtly reminding Alice about John's offer and the risk of losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go much lower than my previous offer. I'm willing to meet you at $17000. This is my absolute final offer. If you can't accept this, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear that Alice is not willing to meet my price needs. While she lowered her offer, it's still significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. It's time to walk away and take John's offer. 

While I could potentially negotiate further with Alice, the risk of wasting more time and still ending up with a price higher than $8,000 is too great.  John's offer provides a guaranteed price point that fits my budget."
