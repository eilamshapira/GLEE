"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000), I would be losing money by accepting this offer. Also, since John's price equals my maximum value, any counteroffer that Alice might accept (which would need to be above her value of $1,200,000) would be worse than John's price. Therefore, the best decision is to buy from John.
