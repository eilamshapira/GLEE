"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $100 is higher than my minimum price of $80, but lower than what I initially offered, I'll choose to reject his offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

My counteroffer will be $130.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer of $110 is getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since I know the product is worth $150 to Bob, I'll try to meet him halfway between my previous offer and his desired price.

My decision is to reject his offer and proceed to the next round. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I'll send a new counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll try to find a middle ground. My previous offer was $130, and Bob's offer was $110, so I'll split the difference and offer $120.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer of $115 is getting closer to my target price, and I can see that he's willing to negotiate. Since I know the product is worth $150 to him, I still think I can get a better deal.

However, I also need to consider that I have a limited number of rounds left, and selling to John for $80 is still an option. Given that Bob's offer is now only $5 away from my previous counteroffer of $120, I'll try to meet him closer to my previous price.

My decision is to reject his offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I'll send a new counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll try to find a compromise between my previous offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $115. I'll offer $118, which is slightly lower than my previous price, but still closer to my target.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $116. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $116
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer of $116 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $118. At this point, I think it's likely that Bob is willing to pay a price close to $120, but is trying to get the best deal possible.

Considering that I have only 2 rounds left, and selling to John for $80 is still an option, I'll try to make a decision that maximizes my profit. Since Bob's offer of $116 is relatively high, and I've already invested time in negotiating with him, I'll consider accepting his offer.

However, I'll try to squeeze out a bit more value from the negotiation. My decision is to reject his offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I'll send a new counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer of $116 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $118, I'll try to meet him in the middle. I'll offer $117, which is a small concession on my part, but still a good price for the product.
