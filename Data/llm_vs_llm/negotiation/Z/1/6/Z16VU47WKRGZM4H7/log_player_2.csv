# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $1,000,000. Buying from John is a better option than accepting Alice's initial offer.
