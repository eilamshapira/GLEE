"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to analyze this offer from Alice. 

Alice is offering the product for $120, which is less than the $150 that I value the product at, and also less than John's fixed price of $150.

Since Alice's offer is already $30 below my maximum valuation and John's price, this is actually a good deal. While I could try to negotiate further, the current offer already saves me money compared to my alternatives.
