"Hello Alice, thanks for offering your product. While it seems like a nice item, $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I understand $180 may be higher than you expected, but $100 is too low for me considering the product's value. I can offer it to you for $150, which is a fair price given its quality. Let me know if this works for you.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit on the price.  While $150 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to find a deal.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
