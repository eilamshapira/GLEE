"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $90, I'm afraid I can't go that low as the product is worth at least $120 to me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, so I'm willing to come down to $130. This is still a good value considering the quality of the product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $130. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",110.0,Bob,4,
