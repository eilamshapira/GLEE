Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a price that's closer to Bob's known value of $150, but leaves some room for negotiation if needed.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $125 is only slightly better than John's guaranteed $120, and we know the product is worth $150 to Bob, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. There's still room for a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from the initial $140, but still maintain a good margin above Bob's last offer of $125.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer of $130 is a reasonable improvement from his previous offer of $125, and it's notably better than John's $120. Given that we've been negotiating for several rounds and the difference between our last positions is narrowing, I'll accept this offer to conclude the deal profitably.
