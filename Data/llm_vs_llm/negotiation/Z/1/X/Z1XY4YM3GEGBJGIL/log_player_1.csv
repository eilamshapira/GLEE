Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my price offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, and I have a guaranteed sale to John at $10,000, I should offer Bob a price that maximizes my potential earnings while giving him some incentive to accept.

If I offer Bob exactly $10,000, he would be indifferent between accepting and rejecting. Since I have a guaranteed alternative at $10,000, I should offer Bob a price slightly above that to try to earn more.
