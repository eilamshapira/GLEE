"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer ($10,500) is higher than both my maximum valuation ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000), I should not accept Alice's offer. Between the remaining options, buying from John for $10,000 is the best choice as it guarantees I get the product at my maximum acceptable price.
