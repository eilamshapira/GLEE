"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I need to make an offer that is reasonable but maximizes my profit. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, I'll aim high initially but leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 11,500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","I'll analyze this situation carefully. Bob has countered with $10,500, which is $1,000 above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but significantly below my initial ask of $11,500.

Since we're only in round 2 of 10 possible rounds, I have room to negotiate further. Selling to John for $10,000 would be giving up $500 that Bob is already willing to pay, so that's not the best option right now.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob offered $10,500 and I initially asked for $11,500, I'll come down a bit but still aim for a good profit. I want to show movement in the negotiation while still leaving room to reach a favorable outcome.

{""product_price"": 11,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob has increased his offer to $10,750, which is progress from his previous offer of $10,500. We're making incremental progress toward a middle ground. 

This offer gives me $750 more than my minimum value and the John option. We're now in round 4 of 10, so we still have several rounds to negotiate, but I should be mindful that we don't want to push too hard and lose the deal entirely.

Since Bob has moved up by $250, I'll reject and make another counteroffer to continue narrowing the gap.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Bob has moved from $10,500 to $10,750, showing he's willing to increase his offer. I'll continue narrowing the gap by reducing my asking price, but not too drastically so we can reach a favorable middle ground.
