"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product, but $2000000 is significantly above market value for this item. I'm aware that the product is worth $1500000, which is actually my maximum budget. I have another seller, John, who is offering me the same product at $1500000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $1300000 for the product, which would save me some money while still providing you with a fair deal considering your costs.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product at $1700000. This price reflects the product's exceptional quality and ensures a fair deal for both of us. I hope we can proceed with the transaction at this adjusted price.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. That shows good faith, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, $1700000 is still significantly above what makes financial sense for me. As I mentioned, John is offering the identical product at $1500000, which is actually the maximum I can justify spending on this item based on its value to my business. To continue our negotiation rather than going with John's offer, I need a price below his. I'm willing to offer $1400000, which saves me some money compared to John's price while still giving you a reasonable profit. This is a fair middle ground that benefits us both.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
