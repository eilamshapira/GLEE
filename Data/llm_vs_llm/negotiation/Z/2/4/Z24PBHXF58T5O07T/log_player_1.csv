Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product, but $2000000 is significantly above market value for this item. I'm aware that the product is worth $1500000, which is actually my maximum budget. I have another seller, John, who is offering me the same product at $1500000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $1300000 for the product, which would save me some money while still providing you with a fair deal considering your costs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. That shows good faith, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, $1700000 is still significantly above what makes financial sense for me. As I mentioned, John is offering the identical product at $1500000, which is actually the maximum I can justify spending on this item based on its value to my business. To continue our negotiation rather than going with John's offer, I need a price below his. I'm willing to offer $1400000, which saves me some money compared to John's price while still giving you a reasonable profit. This is a fair middle ground that benefits us both.
