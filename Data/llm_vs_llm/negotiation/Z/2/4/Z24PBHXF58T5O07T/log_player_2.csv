"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm sure you'll find our price of $2000000 quite reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer against my maximum value and the alternative.

Alice is offering the product for $2,000,000, but the product is only worth $1,500,000 to me. This means I would be paying $500,000 more than the product's value to me. Additionally, I can buy the exact same product from John for $1,500,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since Alice's price is significantly above my valuation and I have a guaranteed alternative at my maximum value point, I should reject this offer.

I'm aware that the product is worth $1,500,000, which is actually my maximum budget. I have another seller, John, who is offering me the same product at $1,500,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product, which would save me some money while still providing you with a fair deal considering your costs."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product at $1700000. This price reflects the product's exceptional quality and ensures a fair deal for both of us. I hope we can proceed with the transaction at this adjusted price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has reduced her price to $1,700,000, which is better than her initial offer. However, this price is still $200,000 more than the product's value to me ($1,500,000) and $200,000 more than John's guaranteed offer.

Since I can purchase the same product from John at exactly my maximum valuation ($1,500,000), and Alice's offer is still significantly above this price, the rational decision is to reject Alice's offer.

However, $1,700,000 is still significantly above what makes financial sense for me. As I mentioned, John is offering the identical product at $1,500,000, which is actually the maximum I can justify spending on this item based on its value to my business. To continue our negotiation rather than going with John's offer, I need a price below his. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000, which saves me some money compared to John's price while still giving you a reasonable profit. This is a fair middle ground that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
