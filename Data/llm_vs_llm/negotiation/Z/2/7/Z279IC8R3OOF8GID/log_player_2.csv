"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than the product's worth to me ($12,000) and higher than John's price ($12,000). I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than John's price but still reasonable enough to potentially interest Alice.

{""product_price"": 10000}

This offer gives Alice a chance to negotiate while still being lower than my maximum value and John's price. It leaves room for negotiation while potentially saving me money compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $16,000 is still significantly higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000). While she has reduced the price from her initial offer, it's still not competitive. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice reduced her price by $2,000, I'll increase my previous offer to show willingness to negotiate, but still stay well below John's price.

{""product_price"": 11000}

This offer is $1,000 higher than my previous offer, showing good faith in negotiations, while still being $1,000 less than John's price. This gives Alice room to make a profit while potentially saving me money compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000). While she continues to lower her price, it's still not competitive with John's offer. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round. If we can't reach an agreement soon, I may need to consider taking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing her price to $14,000, I'll increase my offer slightly again.

{""product_price"": 11500}

This offer is $500 higher than my previous offer, continuing to show willingness to negotiate while still staying below John's price of $12,000. If Alice doesn't accept an offer close to this, I may need to consider taking John's offer soon as we're already in round 6 of 10."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, even though Alice has come down significantly in price, her offer of $13,000 is still above John's price of $12,000. Given that we're in round 7 of 10, and Alice's offers are still above John's price (and my maximum value), it makes more sense to take John's guaranteed offer of $12,000 rather than risk further negotiations that might not result in a better deal."
