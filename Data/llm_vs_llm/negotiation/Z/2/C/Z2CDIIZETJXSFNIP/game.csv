"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10000 is significantly below the product's value. While I understand you're working with a budget, I need to ensure I receive fair value for this product. I can reduce my initial asking price to $16000, which is still a competitive price given the product's worth.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $16000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about $11500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,
