"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $17,500. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and benefits."", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offered price of $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Since Bob's initial offer is significantly low, I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but I'll keep John's offer of $15,000 as a solid backup option if we can't reach a suitable agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is significantly below the product's value. While I understand you're working with a budget, I need to ensure I receive fair value for this product. I can reduce my initial asking price to $16,000, which is still a competitive price given the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $16000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about $11500? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll take John's offer of $15,000. Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and his latest offer of $11,500 is still significantly lower. Given that we've already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation and Bob's increments are relatively small, it seems unlikely that we'll reach an agreement above $15,000. Therefore, it's in my best interest to accept John's guaranteed offer of $15,000 rather than continue negotiations that may not lead to a better outcome."
