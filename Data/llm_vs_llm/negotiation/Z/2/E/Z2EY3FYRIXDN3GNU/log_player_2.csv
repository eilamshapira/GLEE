"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Given that Alice's initial offer is $1,000,000, which is the same price as John's offer and equal to my maximum valuation, it makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer. Since we have 10 rounds of negotiation available, I can try to negotiate a better price with Alice, knowing I always have John's $1,000,000 offer as a backup.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low that it would be considered unreasonable. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, I'll start with an offer at 70% of that value.
