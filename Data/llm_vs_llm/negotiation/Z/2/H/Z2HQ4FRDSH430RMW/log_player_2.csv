"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I'm offering to you first. It's valued at no less than $8000, but given its quality and potential value to you, I'm setting the price at $10000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a high-value product. Are you interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer is $10,000, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, and I can get the same product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in accepting Alice's offer over buying from John. However, given that my goal is to save as much money as possible and Alice might be willing to negotiate if I reject her initial offer, the best strategy would be to reject her offer and see if she lowers the price.
