"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Would you consider $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a better price, $105 is too low considering the product's value. I can come down to $110, which I believe is a fair compromise for both of us. This gives you a good deal while allowing me to cover my costs.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks Alice, I understand. $110 is better. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?",107.5,Bob,4,
