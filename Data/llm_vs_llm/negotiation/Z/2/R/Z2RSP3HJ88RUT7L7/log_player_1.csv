Send your offer to Bob.,"Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price, I'll start with a higher offer to Bob to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I don't go below my minimum acceptable price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Bob at such a low price point.
