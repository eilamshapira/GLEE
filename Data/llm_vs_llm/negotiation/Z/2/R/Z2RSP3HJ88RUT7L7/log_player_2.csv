"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The current offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value ($800,000) and also higher than John's price ($800,000). It would be better to either negotiate with Alice for a lower price or buy from John. Since we still have the option to negotiate, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 600000}

I'm offering $600,000 for the product. This is a strategic opening counteroffer that:
1. Is below my maximum value of $800,000
2. Leaves room for negotiation upward
3. Is still potentially profitable for Alice (though less than her desired price)
4. Keeps John's $800,000 offer as a backup option

If Alice rejects this, we can negotiate further, or I always have the option to go with John's offer of $800,000."
