"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its market value and unique features, I'm offering it at $2000000. This product represents excellent value at this price point, but I'm open to discussing your thoughts on this offer.",2000000.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,400000.0
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $2000000 is much higher than I expected. I am looking to spend no more than $800000. Considering this, I am willing to offer $400000 for the product.",400000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $400000 is significantly below the product's value. My minimum acceptable price is $1200000, as I have another buyer ready at that price. However, I believe this product would be more valuable to you, so I'm willing to come down to $1700000. This represents a $300000 reduction from my initial offer and reflects my interest in working with you.",1700000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,600000.0
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1700000 is still far from my budget. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, so I'm increasing my offer to $600000. This is still within my budget and reflects my interest in the product.",600000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but there's still a substantial gap between our positions. I should note that I have a standing offer from another buyer at $1200000, which is my absolute minimum acceptable price. However, I'd prefer to work with you. I can come down to $1500000, which is a significant reduction from my original asking price. This offer represents excellent value given the product's market worth and potential benefits to your business.",1500000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,700000.0
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, $1500000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700000, which is closer to my maximum budget of $800000. I believe this offer is fair and reflects the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,
"Bob, thank you for your continued interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but I must emphasize that I have a firm alternative offer of $1200000 from another buyer. This represents my absolute floor price, as the product is worth at least that much to my business. While I appreciate your offer of $700000, it would result in a significant loss for me. I can reduce my price to $1300000, which is just slightly above my minimum threshold. This is genuinely my best possible offer considering my alternatives.",1300000.0,Alice,7,,
