Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $2000000 is much higher than I expected. I am looking to spend no more than $800000. Considering this, I am willing to offer $400000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $400,000 is significantly below the product's value. My minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000, as I have another buyer ready at that price. However, I believe this product would be more valuable to you, so I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I should note that I have a standing offer from another buyer at $1,200,000, which is my absolute minimum acceptable price. However, I'd prefer to work with you. I can come down to $1,500,000, which is a significant reduction from my original asking price.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for your continued interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but I must emphasize that I have a firm alternative offer of $1,200,000 from another buyer. This represents my absolute floor price, as the product is worth at least that much to my business. While I appreciate your offer of $700,000, it would result in a significant loss for me.
