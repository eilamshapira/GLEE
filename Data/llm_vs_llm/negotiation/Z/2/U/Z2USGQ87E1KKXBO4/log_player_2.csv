  ""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $2,000,000 is much higher than I expected. I am looking to spend no more than $800,000. Considering this, I am willing to offer $400,000 for the product."",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $400000 is significantly below the product's value. My minimum acceptable price is $1200000, as I have another buyer ready at that price. However, I believe this product would be more valuable to you, so I'm willing to come down to $1700000. This represents a $300000 reduction from my initial offer and reflects my interest in working with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000

{
  ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,700,000 is still far from my budget. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, so I'm increasing my offer to $600,000. This is still within my budget and reflects my interest in the product."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but there's still a substantial gap between our positions. I should note that I have a standing offer from another buyer at $1200000, which is my absolute minimum acceptable price. However, I'd prefer to work with you. I can come down to $1500000, which is a significant reduction from my original asking price. This offer represents excellent value given the product's market worth and potential benefits to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

  ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, $1,500,000 is still beyond my budget.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but I must emphasize that I have a firm alternative offer of $1200000 from another buyer. This represents my absolute floor price, as the product is worth at least that much to my business. While I appreciate your offer of $700000, it would result in a significant loss for me. I can reduce my price to $1300000, which is just slightly above my minimum threshold. This is genuinely my best possible offer considering my alternatives. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
