"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it's really valuable, but I'm open to hearing what you think it's worth. How about we start at $200?",200.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out. However, I think $200 is a bit high for this product. I've actually found the same product from another seller for $150. I'd be willing to buy it from you for $120, which would save you the hassle of finding another buyer. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand where you're coming from, but $120 is cutting it a bit too close to my bottom line.  Could you meet me halfway at $160?  I'm confident this product will be a great value for you.",160.0,Alice,3,
