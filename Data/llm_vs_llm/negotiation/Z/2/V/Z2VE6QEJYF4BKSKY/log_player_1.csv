"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it's really valuable, but I'm open to hearing what you think it's worth. How about we start at $200?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out. However, I think $200 is a bit high for this product. I've actually found the same product from another seller for $150. I'd be willing to buy it from you for $120, which would save you the hassle of finding another buyer. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand where you're coming from, but $120 is cutting it a bit too close to my bottom line.  Could you meet me halfway at $160?  I'm confident this product will be a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 160}"
