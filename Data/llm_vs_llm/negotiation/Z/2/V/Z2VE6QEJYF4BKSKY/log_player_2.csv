"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it's really valuable, but I'm open to hearing what you think it's worth. How about we start at $200? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to consider Alice's offer of $200 for the product. Since:
1) The product is worth at most $150 to me
2) John is willing to sell it for $150
3) Alice's offer of $200 is above both the maximum value to me and John's price

It makes no sense to accept Alice's offer at $200. I should either counter-offer or buy from John directly.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out. However, I think $200 is a bit high for this product. I've actually found the same product from another seller for $150. I'd be willing to buy it from you for $120, which would save you the hassle of finding another buyer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand where you're coming from, but $120 is cutting it a bit too close to my bottom line.  Could you meet me halfway at $160?  I'm confident this product will be a great value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has countered with an offer of $160, which is still above the $150 I can get from John. Given that the product is worth no more than $150 to me, it wouldn't be rational to pay $160.

Comparing my options:
1) Accept Alice's offer of $160: This would cost me $10 more than my maximum value
2) Make another counteroffer: This gives me a chance to negotiate a better price
3) Buy from John for $150: This guarantees I get the product at my maximum value

Since John's offer matches exactly the maximum I'm willing to pay, and Alice's offer exceeds this amount, the logical choice is:
