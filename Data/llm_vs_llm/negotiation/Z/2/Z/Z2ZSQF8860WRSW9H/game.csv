"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $2000000 is significantly above my valuation. My budget is much lower. I'm willing to offer $600000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $2000000 might be above your budget, but $600000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. My new offer is $1800000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. However, $1800000 is still way too high for me. I'm getting closer to my limit with this product, and I'm genuinely interested, but I can only realistically offer $700000.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $700000 is still below my expectations. I'm willing to make another compromise, considering your genuine interest in the product. My new offer is $1500000. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price. However, I'm also trying to be responsible with my budget. My absolute maximum for this product is $775000. If that doesn't work, I'll have to look at other options.",775000.0,Bob,6,
