"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product to me. I'm interested in buying it, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $15000? It's a fair price for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about $11500? I think that's a reasonable compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. $11500 is closer, but still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13000. It's a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to move forward.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. However, $13000 is still above my target price. Considering I can buy the product from another seller for $10000, I'm willing to make a serious offer of $10500. This is my highest offer, and I hope we can close the deal at this price.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and the effort you've put into this negotiation. $10500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the difference and go with $11750. This is my final offer.",11750.0,Alice,7,
