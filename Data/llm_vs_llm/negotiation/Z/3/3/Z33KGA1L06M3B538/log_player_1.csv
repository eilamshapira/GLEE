Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product to me. I'm interested in buying it, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. However, $13000 is still above my target price.
