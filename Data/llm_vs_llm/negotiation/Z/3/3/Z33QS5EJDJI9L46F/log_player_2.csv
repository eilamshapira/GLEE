"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The price offered by Alice ($1,500,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($1,000,000) and John's guaranteed offer ($1,000,000). Even if I try to negotiate with Alice, since the product is worth $1,200,000 to her, it's unlikely she would go below that price. Therefore, the best decision is to buy from John at $1,000,000, which matches my maximum valuation and guarantees the purchase."
