"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I need to be transparent that your asking price is substantially above my budget. I can offer $1000000 for the product. This is a fair offer considering market conditions, and I'm ready to close the deal promptly if we can agree on a reasonable price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your candidness. However, to account for the unique value of this product, I can lower my price to $1300000. I believe this is a fair compromise. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I need to be straightforward with you - I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $1200000. For me to continue our negotiation rather than go with the alternative, I would need a price below that. My offer is $1100000, which gives you a quick sale and saves me the trouble of working with a different seller. Does that work for you?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To keep this deal moving forward, I can go down to $1250000. I believe this represents a valuable opportunity for you. Let me know what you think!",1250000.0,Alice,5,
