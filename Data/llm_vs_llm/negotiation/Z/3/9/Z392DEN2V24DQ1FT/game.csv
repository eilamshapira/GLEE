"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I agree this product has value, but the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $650000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I'm willing to negotiate further, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the counter.  I understand you're firm on the value, but I'm afraid we're still quite a ways apart.  To be frank, I can't go higher than $700000 for this product. If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer, but a bit closer to my target. I'm thinking of $950000 is a bit low, so I will do $1000000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the move towards the middle ground, but that price is still too high for me. I'm willing to bump my offer slightly to $750000.  That's a significant investment for me, and I need to be mindful of my budget.  Let me know if that works for you.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. Considering we're getting closer to the end of our negotiation, I'm willing to make a more significant concession. I'm thinking of $1050000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're getting close to the wire here. I can appreciate your position, but I need to be realistic about my budget. My absolute final offer is $775000.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to thank you for your time and consider my other options.",775000.0,Bob,8,
