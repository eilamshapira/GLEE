Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I agree this product has value, but the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $650000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $650,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate and try to reach a better price. Selling to John is an option, but I want to explore the possibility of reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob first. 

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the counter.  I understand you're firm on the value, but I'm afraid we're still quite a ways apart.  To be frank, I can't go higher than $700000 for this product. If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $700,000 is still significantly lower than the product's worth to me. While he has increased his offer, it's not enough to meet my expectations. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer. I still have 6 rounds left to negotiate and try to reach a better price. Selling to John is still an option, but I want to continue exploring the possibility of reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob.

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer, but a bit closer to my target. I'm thinking of $950,000 is a bit low, so I will do $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the move towards the middle ground, but that price is still too high for me. I'm willing to bump my offer slightly to $750000.  That's a significant investment for me, and I need to be mindful of my budget.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $750,000 is still lower than the product's worth to me. While he has increased his offer again, it's not enough to meet my expectations. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer. I still have 4 rounds left to negotiate and try to reach a better price. Selling to John is still an option, but I want to continue exploring the possibility of reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob.

However, considering the slow progress in the negotiation, I will start to consider selling to John more seriously. If Bob's next offer is not significantly better, I may decide to sell to John.

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. Considering we're getting closer to the end of our negotiation, I'm willing to make a more significant concession. I'm thinking of $1,050,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close to the wire here. I can appreciate your position, but I need to be realistic about my budget. My absolute final offer is $775000.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to thank you for your time and consider my other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Considering Bob's final offer of $775,000, I have decided that it's not in my best interest to continue negotiating with him. The offer is still significantly lower than the product's worth to me, and I don't believe that further negotiations will result in a mutually agreeable price.

Given that I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, which meets my expectations, I have decided to sell the product to him. This decision ensures that I receive a fair price for the product and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob not resulting in a satisfactory outcome.

I will end the negotiations with Bob and proceed with the sale to John."
