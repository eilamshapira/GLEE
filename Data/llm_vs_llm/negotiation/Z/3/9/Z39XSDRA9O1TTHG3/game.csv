"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $15000, which I think is a fair price considering its features and quality. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand your budget constraints, so I can reduce my initial offer to $13500. This is still a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. Would you consider this revised offer?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $13500 is still beyond what I'm willing to spend. I can go up to $9500. Is this something you can work with?",9500.0,Bob,4,
