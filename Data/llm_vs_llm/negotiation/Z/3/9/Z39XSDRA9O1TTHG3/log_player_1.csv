"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $15,000, which I think is a fair price considering its features and quality. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offered price of $9,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and even below Bob's own valuation of $10,000. I will make a counteroffer in the next round, lowering my initial price somewhat but still maintaining a price above my minimum threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand your budget constraints, so I can reduce my initial offer to $13,500. This is still a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. Would you consider this revised offer?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $13500 is still beyond what I'm willing to spend. I can go up to $9500. Is this something you can work with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I choose to sell to John for $12,000. Bob's offers have been consistently below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and his latest offer of $9,500 shows only a small increase from his previous offer. Since we know the product is only worth $10,000 to Bob, it's unlikely he'll ever offer more than that. Therefore, selling to John for $12,000 is the most profitable option."
