"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Based on its value and the interest I've seen, I'm willing to let it go for $25000. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling me this product, but $25000 is well above what I can justify spending. Based on my research and the product's value to me, I can offer $12000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. Considering the product's rarity and features, I'm willing to come down to $23000. That's a significant drop from my initial offer. Let me know what you think.",23000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $23000 is still well above what makes sense for me. To be completely transparent, I have another seller (John) who's offering the same product for $15000. I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer $13500, which is higher than my previous offer and still gives you a good sale. If we can't get closer on price, I'll need to go with the other option.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate you being upfront. I'm willing to meet you closer to your needs, and to show that I'm willing to work with you, I will reduce the price to $20000. This is the lowest I am willing to go for now.",20000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down further in price. However, I need to be completely clear - I know this product is worth no more than $15000 to me, and as I mentioned, I have John's offer at exactly $15000. I'd like to do business with you, but I can only justify paying $14000 at most, which would still save you the trouble of finding another buyer. This is very close to my absolute maximum, so please let me know if we can reach an agreement at this price.",14000.0,Bob,6,
