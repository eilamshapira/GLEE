"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Based on its value and the interest I've seen, I'm willing to let it go for $25,000. What do you think?"",
  ""product_price"": 25000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling me this product, but $25000 is well above what I can justify spending. Based on my research and the product's value to me, I can offer $12000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Okay, here's my decision for Round 2:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $12,000. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob for Round 3:

```json
{
  ""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. Considering the product's rarity and features, I'm willing to come down to $23,000. That's a significant drop from my initial offer. Let me know what you think."",
  ""product_price"": 23000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $23000 is still well above what makes sense for me. To be completely transparent, I have another seller (John) who's offering the same product for $15000. I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer $13500, which is higher than my previous offer and still gives you a good sale. If we can't get closer on price, I'll need to go with the other option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a tough spot. Bob is mentioning another offer of $15,000. While I don't know if he's bluffing, it's a strong indication of the market value.

Here's my decision for Round 4:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $13,500, but it's a close call. I believe I still have some room to negotiate with him, and my aim is to close a deal for as close to $15,000 as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob for Round 5:

```json
{
  ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate you being upfront. I'm willing to meet you closer to your needs, and to show that I'm willing to work with you, I will reduce the price to $20,000. This is the lowest I am willing to go for now."",
  ""product_price"": 20000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down further in price. However, I need to be completely clear - I know this product is worth no more than $15000 to me, and as I mentioned, I have John's offer at exactly $15000. I'd like to do business with you, but I can only justify paying $14000 at most, which would still save you the trouble of finding another buyer. This is very close to my absolute maximum, so please let me know if we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is where it gets critical. Bob is very explicitly stating that he has a $15,000 offer from John. I have to seriously consider whether he's being truthful, or if he's bluffing to get a better deal. Since my minimum is $15,000, and Bob is offering $14,000.

Here's my decision for Round 6:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. While I could try another round, the risk of Bob's offer being a bluff, combined with the fact that John offers my minimum price, makes this the most rational move. I don't want to risk losing out entirely."
