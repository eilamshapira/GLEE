"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Based on its value and the interest I've seen, I'm willing to let it go for $25000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's asking price of $25,000 is significantly higher than the $15,000 the product is worth to me, and it's also higher than John's guaranteed offer of $15,000. Since I want to save as much money as possible, I should either try to negotiate with Alice for a better price or go with John's offer. Let me reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling me this product, but $25,000 is well above what I can justify spending. Based on my research and the product's value to me, I can offer $12,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. Considering the product's rarity and features, I'm willing to come down to $23000. That's a significant drop from my initial offer. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $23,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $23,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has only reduced her price to $23,000, which is still significantly above both my maximum value ($15,000) and John's offer ($15,000). Since there's no benefit to accepting Alice's current offer, I should continue negotiating or consider John's offer. Let me reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $23,000 is still well above what makes sense for me. To be completely transparent, I have another seller (John) who's offering the same product for $15,000. I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer $13,500, which is higher than my previous offer and still gives you a good sale. If we can't get closer on price, I'll need to go with the other option."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate you being upfront. I'm willing to meet you closer to your needs, and to show that I'm willing to work with you, I will reduce the price to $20000. This is the lowest I am willing to go for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's offer of $20,000 is still higher than both my maximum value ($15,000) and John's guaranteed price ($15,000). There's no advantage to accepting this offer, and Alice doesn't seem to be moving quickly toward a price below $15,000. At this point, it makes more sense to reject and either make another counteroffer or simply go with John's offer.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down further in price. However, I need to be completely clear - I know this product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, and as I mentioned, I have John's offer at exactly $15,000. I'd like to do business with you, but I can only justify paying $14,000 at most, which would still save you the trouble of finding another buyer. This is very close to my absolute maximum, so please let me know if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
