Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I should definitely not accept Alice's offer of $100, as the product is only worth $80 to me, and I want to save money. Buying from John for $80 is an option, but I might be able to get a better deal from Alice. Since it's the first round, I will try to negotiate.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, let's try to get a good deal. I know the product is worth $80 to me, and Alice values it at $80 as well. I will start with a low offer, but not too low to seem unreasonable.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","The price has decreased, but it's still more than I'm willing to pay. Buying from John for $80 is now a more attractive option. Since I have several rounds left, I will try to negotiate one more time to see if I can get the price down further.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
