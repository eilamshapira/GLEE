"Good morning, Bob. I'm excited to begin discussing the sale of this truly unique and valuable product with you. Given its exceptional qualities and the significant benefits it will bring to you, my initial asking price is $950000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I believe $950000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay up to $700000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're carefully considering the price. To move things forward, I'm willing to offer a slight reduction. Let's meet in the middle a bit more - how about $910000?",910000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $910000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $750000, which I believe is a fair price given the value of the product to me. What do you say?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I am really trying to make this work. How about we settle at $850000? That's a significant step down from my original ask and a great price for you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, $850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $780000, which I think is a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",780000.0,Bob,6,
