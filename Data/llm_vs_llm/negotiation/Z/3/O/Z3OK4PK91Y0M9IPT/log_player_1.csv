Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000 and I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, I will choose to sell to John to ensure I meet my minimum requirement.
