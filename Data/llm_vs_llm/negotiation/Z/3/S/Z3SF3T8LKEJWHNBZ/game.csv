"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $250 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $75. Let me know if that works for you.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $75, I can't go that low as the product's quality and value are quite high. I can come down to $200, which is already a significant discount from my initial offer. The product has excellent features that justify this price point. Let me know if this works better for you.",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $200 is still out of my budget. I can increase my offer to $85. This is the highest I can go while staying within my financial limits. Let me know if this is acceptable.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but unfortunately $85 is still significantly below the product's value. The lowest I can go is $175, which is already a substantial reduction from my original price. The quality and features of this product justify this price point. If your budget is very limited, I understand, but I can't go any lower than $175 at this time.",175.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $175 is still too high for me. I can stretch my budget a bit more and offer $90. This is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if you can accept this price.",90.0,Bob,6,
