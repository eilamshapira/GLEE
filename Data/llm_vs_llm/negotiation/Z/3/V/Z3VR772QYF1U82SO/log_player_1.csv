"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be an excellent investment for you.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I believe the product's value to me is around $1000000. Considering the potential returns and my budget constraints, I'd like to counteroffer at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
# Explanation: The offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below what I believe Bob would be willing to pay, given the product is worth $1,500,000 to him. There's still room for negotiation, and with 8 rounds remaining, I can make a counteroffer to find a better middle ground between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to point out that this product has exceptional value. While I understand your budget constraints, my price needs to reflect the product's true worth. I can come down to $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's market value and the returns it will generate for you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $1200000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1100000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering both the product's value and my financial situation. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
# Explanation: Bob has moved up significantly from his initial offer of $1,000,000 to $1,100,000. While this is still below the maximum he might pay, it's a solid profit margin above my minimum of $800,000. With 6 rounds remaining, there's a risk that continued negotiation might lead to deal fatigue or Bob walking away. The current offer represents a good compromise and ensures a profitable deal."
