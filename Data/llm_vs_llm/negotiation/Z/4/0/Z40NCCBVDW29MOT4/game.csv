"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe the product is valuable, but the price of $17500 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000, considering the market value and my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $10000 as it's significantly below the product's value. I understand my initial offer might have been high, so I'm willing to reduce it to $16000. This is still a fair price considering the product's quality and market value.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for reducing the price to $16000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still find it a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000, which is the highest I'm willing to pay considering my options and the market value.",12000.0,Bob,4,
