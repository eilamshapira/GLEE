Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it for $17,500. This is a fair price considering the quality and value of the product."", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe the product is valuable, but the price of $17500 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000, considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and since I have John willing to pay $15,000, I won't accept anything lower. However, I'll try one more time with Bob at a lower price than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $10,000 as it's significantly below the product's value. I understand my initial offer might have been high, so I'm willing to reduce it to $16,000. This is still a fair price considering the product's quality and market value."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for reducing the price to $16000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still find it a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000, which is the highest I'm willing to pay considering my options and the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $15,000. Bob's maximum offer of $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and since John is willing to pay $15,000, that's the better option for me. There's no point in continuing negotiations with Bob since he's clearly indicated $12,000 is his maximum offer."
