"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offered price of $12,000 is quite high considering that the product is worth only $8,000 to Alice. While it's below John's price of $15,000, there's room for negotiation to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 9000}

I'll offer $9,000, which is slightly above Alice's valuation of $8,000. This gives Alice a reasonable profit margin of $1,000 while still being significantly better for me than the initial $12,000 offer or John's $15,000 price. This leaves room for further negotiation if needed, but represents a fair starting point that could be acceptable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer of $10,500. This is a reasonable compromise between my counteroffer of $9,000 and Alice's initial offer of $12,000. It's significantly better than John's price of $15,000, and Alice has moved considerably from her initial position. While I might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice becoming less cooperative, and $10,500 represents a fair price given that it's worth $8,000 to Alice. This deal saves me $4,500 compared to buying from John, which is a good outcome."
