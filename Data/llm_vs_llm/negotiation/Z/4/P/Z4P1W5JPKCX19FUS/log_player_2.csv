"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1000000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I could get from another buyer.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $1,000,000 exceeds that value, it would not be a good decision to accept her offer. 

Given that I have the option to buy the product from John for $800,000, which is within my budget and the maximum value I place on the product, the best decision would be to reject Alice's offer and buy from John instead.
