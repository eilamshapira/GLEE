"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that my initial price may have been a bit steep, but I still believe the product is worth more than $1000000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1650000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000, which is the highest I can go while still considering this a good deal. Let me know if this works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the new offer. I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but $1425000 is still too high for me. I can stretch my budget a bit more and offer $1150000. This is really the top of my range. Let me know if we can close the deal at this price.",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, $1375000 is still beyond what I can justify. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1175000, but this is absolutely my final offer. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",1175000.0,Bob,8,
