"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but the price is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1000000. Let me know if we can work with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, hoping to get closer to my target price. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is still an option, but I'd like to explore the possibility of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob first."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that my initial price may have been a bit steep, but I still believe the product is worth more than $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1650000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000, which is the highest I can go while still considering this a good deal. Let me know if this works for you.

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my target, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'd like to try to meet Bob in the middle, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is still a viable option, but I'll try to negotiate with Bob a bit longer. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the new offer. I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but $1425000 is still too high for me. I can stretch my budget a bit more and offer $1150000. This is really the top of my range. Let me know if we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, $1375000 is still beyond what I can justify. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1175000, but this is absolutely my final offer. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.
