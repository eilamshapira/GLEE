(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","I have to make a decision. I need to consider my options carefully. $900,000 is below my minimum, and I have to weigh it against the possibility of a better offer from Bob or the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. I have 8 rounds remaining, so there's room to maneuver.

I'll try one more counteroffer.
