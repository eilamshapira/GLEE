"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I believe $1250000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000 for the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This reflects the value of the product to you and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1100000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the alternatives available to me. Let me know if this works for you.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $950000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1025000. This allows for some negotiation room and still leaves me with a reasonable profit. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
