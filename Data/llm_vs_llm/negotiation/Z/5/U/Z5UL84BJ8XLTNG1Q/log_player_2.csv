"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a premium product that's truly one-of-a-kind. I'm offering it for $1200000. Let me know if you're interested or have a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll analyze this offer:

Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is $300,000 less than John's price of $1,500,000. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible while purchasing the product, and Alice's offer is already below my maximum value of $1,500,000, this appears to be a good deal.

While I could potentially negotiate for an even lower price by rejecting and making a counteroffer, Alice's initial offer already represents a significant savings compared to the alternative.
