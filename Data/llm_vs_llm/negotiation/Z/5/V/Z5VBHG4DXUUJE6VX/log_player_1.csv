"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I need to maximize my profit and I don't know Bob's valuation, I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I get significantly more than my $80 minimum (John's offer).

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer is only slightly above my minimum value ($80) and we are still in early rounds of negotiation (round 2 of 10), I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer. There's still plenty of room for negotiation, and Bob's willingness to make an offer above $80 suggests he values the product higher than that.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob offered $90, I know he values the product at least at that price. I'll lower my initial offer but still maintain a price that would give me significantly better profit than both Bob's previous offer ($90) and John's standing offer ($80).

{""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob has increased his offer from $90 to $100, showing he's willing to negotiate upward. This is a good sign, but since we still have 6 rounds left and he's showing flexibility, I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Bob has shown willingness to increase his price by $10 (from $90 to $100). I'll reduce my previous offer by a similar proportion to show good faith in the negotiation while still aiming for a better profit than his current offer.

{""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob has increased his offer again to $110, which is a good price - significantly better than John's $80. Given that we're now in round 6 of 10, and Bob has shown consistent but small increases in his offers, I'll accept this offer. There's a risk that if I push too hard, Bob might stop increasing his offers or walk away, leaving me with only John's $80 option.
