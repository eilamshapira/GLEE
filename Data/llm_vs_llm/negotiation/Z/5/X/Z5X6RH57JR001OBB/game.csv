"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is well above my budget for this product. I can offer $60 for it. This is a fair price that works within my budget. Let me know what you think.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $60 just isn't going to work for me. I believe the product's value is higher, so let’s meet in the middle—I can offer it to you for $100. Let me know if that works for you!",100.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $100 is still above what I can spend. I could go up to $70, which is the most I can really justify for this product. Would that work for you?",70.0,Bob,4,
