"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm offering you my exclusive product at $150. Let me know if you're interested in this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's offer of $150 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80), it would not be rational to accept this offer. Given that John is offering the product at my maximum acceptable price, I could go with that option. However, I'll try negotiating with Alice first to potentially get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is well above my budget for this product. I can offer $60 for it. This is a fair price that works within my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $60 just isn't going to work for me. I believe the product's value is higher, so let’s meet in the middle—I can offer it to you for $100. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has lowered her price significantly from $150 to $100, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $100 is still above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). Since I have another guaranteed option at $80, there's no reason to accept a price higher than that.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous one but still below John's price, giving us room to potentially meet in the middle.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $100 is still above what I can spend. I could go up to $70, which is the most I can really justify for this product. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 70}"
