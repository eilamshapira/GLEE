"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product we discussed. I believe it would be a great fit for you! I can offer it to you for $900000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $900,000 is below that threshold, I should consider whether I can get a better deal. However, rejecting Alice's offer means I would have to buy from John for $1,000,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Given that Alice's offer is $100,000 less than what I'm willing to pay and $100,000 less than what John is offering, it seems like a good deal.
