"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000, considering my budget and the value it brings to me. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you have budget considerations, but I need to consider the true value of this product. I can come down from my initial price, but $10000 is too low considering what this product is worth. I can offer it to you for $12800, which represents a significant discount from its market value while still acknowledging its worth. Would this work for you?",12800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $12800 is still a bit above my target. Considering we both want to make a deal, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'd like to propose $11400 as a compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be open to.",11400.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your proposal to meet halfway. I can see you're serious about purchasing this product, and I'm committed to finding a fair price for both of us. After considering your offer, I can come down to $12200. This is a fair value that reflects the quality and worth of the product while also acknowledging your budget constraints. At this price, you'll still be getting excellent value considering the product is worth $15000 to you. What do you think?",12200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm glad we're making progress. However, I still feel that $12200 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given that we've both shown flexibility, I'd like to propose a price of $11800. This is slightly above my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us.",11800.0,Bob,6,
