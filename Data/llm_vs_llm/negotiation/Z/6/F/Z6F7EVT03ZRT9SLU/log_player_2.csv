Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer was $1,100,000 and I want to save as much money as possible, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower, but still reasonable. Considering the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, I'll aim for a price that is closer to that value, but also taking into account that I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's latest offer of $1,000,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between her offer and my previous counteroffer of $900,000. This shows that I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually beneficial price.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for reconsidering and lowering the price to $1,000,000. I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current one. How about we settle on $950,000?"", ""product_price"": 950000}"
