"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer ($1,600,000) is higher than both my maximum value ($1,500,000) and John's price ($1,500,000), I should not accept Alice's offer. Given that John is offering the product at $1,500,000, which equals my maximum value, I should buy from him.
