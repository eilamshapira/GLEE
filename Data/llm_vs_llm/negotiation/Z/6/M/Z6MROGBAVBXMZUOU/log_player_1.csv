"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional quality and the value it can bring to you, I'm confident that it's worth $9,500. I'm open to discussions, but I believe this price reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of your product, but I believe we can find a price point that works better for both of us. Given the current market conditions, I would like to propose $7600 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value while being competitive with other options in the market. What are your thoughts on this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

# Explanation:
Bob's offer of $7,600 is below the guaranteed $8,000 from John, so it does not make sense to accept it directly. Instead, we should continue the negotiation to see if we can reach a better price. Since Bob has indicated a willingness to negotiate and has made an initial offer, there is room to find a mutually beneficial price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's value is higher than what you proposed. To show my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to lower my initial offer to $9,000. This price takes into account the market conditions you mentioned while still reflecting the product's quality and value. What are your thoughts on this adjusted price?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. To meet you partway, I'm willing to increase my offer to $8200. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price that works for both of us. The product is certainly valuable, but this price point better aligns with my budget constraints while still offering you a good return. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

# Explanation:
Bob's new offer of $8,200 is higher than the guaranteed $8,000 from John. Since our goal is to maximize the sale price, accepting Bob's offer of $8,200 is the best choice. This ensures we get more than the minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and there's no guarantee that continuing the negotiation will result in a higher price. Thus, it makes sense to secure this deal now."
