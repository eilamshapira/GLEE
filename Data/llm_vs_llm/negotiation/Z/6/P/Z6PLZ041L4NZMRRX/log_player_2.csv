"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product at a price of $11500. Knowing its value to you, I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Considering the options:

*   **Accept Alice's offer:** This would cost me $11,500.
*   **Buy from John:** This would cost me $12,000.
*   **Reject and Counteroffer:** There's a chance I could negotiate a lower price with Alice. Since I value the product at $12,000 and Alice is offering $11,500, it's worth trying to negotiate.

Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, I'll send Alice a counteroffer. I want to try to get the price down as much as possible, but I also don't want to be unreasonable and risk losing the deal. Given that she offered $11,500, I'll start with a lower price.

```json
{
  ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, I was hoping to pay a bit less. How about $10,750?"",
  ""product_price"": 10750
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate you coming up a bit, $10750 is still lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $11250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Now I have to make a decision.

*   **Accept Alice's offer:** This would cost me $11,250.
*   **Buy from John:** This would cost me $12,000.
*   **Reject and Counteroffer:** I could try to negotiate further, but the price is getting close to what I'm willing to pay.

Since the price is already pretty good, I will accept the offer.
