"Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'll really like. I'm offering it to you for $250. What do you think?",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $250 is quite high for me. The product is worth no more than $100 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it to me for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. Would you consider $80 for the product?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you have other options, but I can't go down to $80. How about we meet in the middle at $180? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $180 is still significantly more than the product is worth to me. As I mentioned, I can get it from John for $100, which is the maximum value of this product to me. To make it worth choosing you over the alternative, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $90 - this gives you the sale and gives me a small savings compared to my other option.",90.0,Bob,4,
