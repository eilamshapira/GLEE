"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'll really like. I'm offering it to you for $250. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $250 is quite high for me. The product is worth no more than $100 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it to me for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. Would you consider $80 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","This is a tough spot. Bob is low-balling, but I don't know how valuable the product is to him. Considering I have a guaranteed $150 from John, and I need to make a decent profit, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you have other options, but I can't go down to $80. How about we meet in the middle at $180? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $180 is still significantly more than the product is worth to me. As I mentioned, I can get it from John for $100, which is the maximum value of this product to me. To make it worth choosing you over the alternative, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $90 - this gives you the sale and gives me a small savings compared to my other option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob is sticking to his guns and still offering a low price. He's clearly trying to get a deal. At this point, I have to consider my options carefully. $90 is still too low, and I'm starting to run out of rounds. I could try to squeeze more out of Bob, but I'm risking losing the sale entirely. The safe bet is to sell to John and guarantee my profit.
