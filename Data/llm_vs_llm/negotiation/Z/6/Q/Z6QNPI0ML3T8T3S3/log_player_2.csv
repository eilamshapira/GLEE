"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'll really like. I'm offering it to you for $250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's offering price of $250 is significantly higher than the product's worth to me (no more than $100) and also higher than John's price of $100. I can either try to negotiate with Alice or go with John's guaranteed price.

Since John's price is already at the maximum value the product is worth to me ($100), and Alice's initial offer is very high, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $250 is quite high for me. The product is worth no more than $100 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it to me for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. Would you consider $80 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you have other options, but I can't go down to $80. How about we meet in the middle at $180? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has reduced her price to $180, which is still above the $100 maximum value to me and higher than John's price. Since I can get the product from John for $100, and the product is only worth up to $100 to me, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer of $180.

I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price from Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $180 is still significantly more than the product is worth to me. As I mentioned, I can get it from John for $100, which is the maximum value of this product to me. To make it worth choosing you over the alternative, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $90 - this gives you the sale and gives me a small savings compared to my other option."", ""product_price"": 90}"
