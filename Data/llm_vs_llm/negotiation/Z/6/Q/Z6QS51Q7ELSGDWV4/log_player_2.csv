"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Looking at the options:

1. Alice's offer is $1,900,000
2. I can reject this offer
3. I can buy from John for $800,000

Given that:
- The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
- John is offering to sell it for exactly $800,000
- Alice's price ($1,900,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's offer

The logical choice is to buy from John, as it will cost me $1,100,000 less than Alice's offer, and matches the maximum I value the product at.
