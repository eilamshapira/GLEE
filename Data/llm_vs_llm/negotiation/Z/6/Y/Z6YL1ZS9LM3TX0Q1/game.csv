"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20000. It's a unique item that I believe will be of great value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the unique value of your product,  $20000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in purchasing, but I'd need to come in at a lower price.  Would you be willing to consider $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob,  $10000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $15000? ",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $10000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $17500. It's a fair compromise and reflects the true value of this unique product.  Let me know what you think.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $17500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13000. This would be a fair price that allows both of us to reach an agreement. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $13000 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and come down to $16000.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of this unique product. ",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $16000 is my final offer. It's a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm confident you'll find this product to be a valuable addition to your collection.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $16000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14000. This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. Let's try to close this out.",14000.0,Bob,6,
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm going to pass.  I've decided to sell to another buyer for $15000.",,Alice,6,SellToJhon
