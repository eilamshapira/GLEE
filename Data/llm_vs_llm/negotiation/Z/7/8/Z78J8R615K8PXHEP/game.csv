"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $9500 seems quite high for this product. I understand you want to make a profit, but I'm looking for a better deal. I'm willing to pay $8300 for the product. This gives you a reasonable profit while also being significantly better than what I could get elsewhere. What do you think?",8300.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your feedback, and I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer you the product for $8800. I believe this is a good compromise that reflects its value. Let me know your thoughts!",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to what I had in mind, but I'd like to meet you closer to the middle between your original cost and my last offer. Would you accept $8550? This would still give you a nice profit margin while helping me stay within my budget.",8550.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and negotiation. How about we settle at $8700 for the product? This still gives you a great deal and ensures I cover my costs. Let me know if this works for you!",8700.0,Alice,5,
