"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad to offer you the product for $9500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","This offer is quite high at $9,500, especially considering the product is only worth $8,000 to Alice. I can likely negotiate a better price since my maximum is $10,000. Rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer, which would save me more money than accepting or buying from John.

I understand you want to make a profit, but I'm looking for a better deal. I'm willing to pay $8,300 for the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your feedback, and I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer you the product for $8800. I believe this is a good compromise that reflects its value. Let me know your thoughts!

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has dropped her price significantly from $9,500 to $8,800, which is a good sign. This is already better than John's price of $10,000, but I think there's still room to negotiate a slightly better deal. Since Alice came down by $700, I should continue negotiating.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to what I had in mind, but I'd like to meet you closer to the middle between your original cost and my last offer. Would you accept $8,550? This would still give you a nice profit margin while helping me stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 8550}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and negotiation. How about we settle at $8700 for the product? This still gives you a great deal and ensures I cover my costs. Let me know if this works for you!

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has moved her price down to $8,700, which is a $100 reduction from her previous offer. We're getting closer to a deal. This is already $1,300 less than John's price, and only $150 more than my last offer. Given that Alice has already reduced her price twice and we're now negotiating over relatively small amounts, I think this is a reasonable deal.
