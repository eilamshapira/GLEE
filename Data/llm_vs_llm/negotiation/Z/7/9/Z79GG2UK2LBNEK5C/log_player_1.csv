Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an initial offer that's relatively high but still below Bob's valuation, giving room for negotiation while trying to maximize my profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $900,000 since it's closer to my minimum value ($800,000) than to his valuation ($1,200,000). There's still room for negotiation to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still maintain a strong position, aiming for a price that's more balanced between our valuations.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $850,000 is only slightly better than John's guaranteed $800,000, and Bob's previous negotiation pattern shows he's not moving up much in price, I'll give it one more try with a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make one more attempt with a lower price than my previous offers, but still significantly above Bob's last offer, trying to find a middle ground that would be attractive to both parties.
