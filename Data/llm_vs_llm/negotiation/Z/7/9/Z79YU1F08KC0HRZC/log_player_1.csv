Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","I will reject Bob's offer of $10,000 since it's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 (which I can get from John), and it wouldn't make economic sense to accept it.
