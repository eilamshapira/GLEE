Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your perspective, I can't go down to $1,300,000. However, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about we settle on $1,400,000?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I was thinking we could meet even closer to the middle. How about $1350000? I believe this is a reasonable price for both of us.
