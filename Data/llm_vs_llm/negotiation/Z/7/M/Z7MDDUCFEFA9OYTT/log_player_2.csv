Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since Alice's offer of $9,500 is higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($8,000), I will reject her offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a relatively low offer.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's new offer of $8,900 is still higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($8,000). Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $8,000, which is my target price, I don't see a need to continue negotiating with Alice.
