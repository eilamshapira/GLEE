Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make a strategic offer to Bob that maximizes my potential profit while considering my fallback option of selling to John for $80.

Since I know I can definitely get $80 from John, I should offer Bob a higher price to potentially earn more. Setting the price too high might lead to rejection, while setting it too close to $80 wouldn't maximize my potential profit.

A reasonable strategy would be to offer the product at a significantly higher price than my fallback option, but not so high that it would immediately be rejected.
