"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $14,000 is well above both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's alternative price ($10,000). It would be irrational to accept this offer when I can either:
1. Make a counteroffer to try to get a better price from Alice
2. Buy from John at $10,000 if negotiations with Alice don't work out

I'll reject and make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 9000}

I'll offer $9,000 for the following reasons:
1. This price is below my maximum value of $10,000, which would allow me to save money
2. While this is below Alice's cost of $12,000, it opens room for negotiation
3. If Alice rejects, I can still fall back on John's offer of $10,000
4. Starting with a lower offer gives room for negotiation upward while still potentially landing at a price better than John's $10,000"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John for $10,000 because:
1. Alice's new offer of $13,000 is still well above my maximum value of $10,000
2. Alice's price is $3,000 higher than John's price
3. Since Alice started at $14,000 and only came down to $13,000 after my $9,000 counteroffer, it seems unlikely that she will drop her price below her cost of $12,000
4. John's price of $10,000 is reasonable and within my budget
5. Continuing negotiations with Alice may be futile since there's a significant gap between her offers and my maximum value

It's best to take the guaranteed good deal from John rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to result in a better price."
