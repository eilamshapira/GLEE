"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand your budget, however, $10000 is quite a bit lower than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be a valuable asset for you.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $17000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $11000.  I believe that's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you working with me on this. While I can't do $11000, I'm willing to come down to $15000. This is my final offer, as this product is in high demand and I have another interested buyer.  What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,5,
