"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. Given its rarity and high demand, I believe it's worth a premium price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000, which I think is a fair value considering its unique features and benefits.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, I find $1200000 to be quite steep. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I would be willing to offer $650000 for the product. This is a fair price that takes into account current market conditions while still recognizing the product's value.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I find $650000 to be below the product's true value. Considering your interest and the product's worth, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer the product to you for $1000000, which is a more reasonable price given its exceptional quality and market demand.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price and working towards a middle ground. While $1000000 shows movement in the right direction, it's still beyond what I can justify for this purchase. I can increase my previous offer to $750000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering market conditions and the product's features.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price. Considering we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer the product to you for $950000, which is a more reasonable price given its exceptional quality and market demand.",950000.0,Alice,5,
