Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product! Considering its exceptional quality and value, I'm willing to let it go for $11,500."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11500 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $10500?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11000 is still a bit high for me. Could you go down to $10750? I think that would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750.
