I'm starting with an aggressive offer, hoping to maximize my profit.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my value. Let's see if this is more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product for $1,100,000.  It's better than selling to John and getting a smaller profit, and it avoids further negotiation."
