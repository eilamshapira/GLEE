"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a valuable product that I'm offering for sale. I believe it could be of great benefit to you. I'm offering it at a price of $1200000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is below my maximum budget of $1,500,000, I'm interested in exploring the possibility of getting a better deal. Therefore, I'll reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer, hoping to negotiate a lower price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, in an attempt to gauge her flexibility and willingness to negotiate. Since I don't know the value of the product to Alice, I'll aim for a price that is roughly half of her initial offer.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $600000 is significantly below what I can accept. How about we meet somewhere in between? I can offer the product to you for $1000000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $1,000,000 is still below my maximum budget of $1,500,000, but it's higher than I was hoping to pay. Since she rejected my previous counteroffer and came back with a price that's $400,000 higher than my offer, it suggests that she may have some flexibility, but is not willing to go as low as I initially proposed.

I'll reject Alice's new offer and try to make another counteroffer, aiming to split the difference between my previous offer and her new price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And then I'll send a new counteroffer: 

{""message"": ""Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
