"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,499,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,499,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,499,000 is less than the $1,500,000 I'm willing to pay, and also less than what I would pay if I were to buy from John, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer to save as much money as possible.
