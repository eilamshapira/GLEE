Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a strategic price to offer Bob that maximizes my profit while giving him enough incentive to accept.

The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and I have a guaranteed backup offer of $8,000 from John.

If I offer Bob a price close to $12,000, he might reject it since he would get minimal value. If I offer too low, I'm leaving money on the table.

A reasonable approach is to split the surplus somewhat in Bob's favor to ensure acceptance. The total surplus is $4,000 ($12,000 - $8,000). I'll offer Bob the product at $10,500, which gives him $1,500 in value while allowing me to earn $2,500 more than my backup option.
