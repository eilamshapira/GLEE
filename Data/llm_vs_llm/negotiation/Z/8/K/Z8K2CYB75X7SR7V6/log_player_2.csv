"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer of $10,500, reject it, or buy from John for $12,000.

Let me analyze my options:
- The product is worth up to $12,000 to me
- Alice's offer is $10,500
- John's price is $12,000

Since Alice's offer ($10,500) is less than John's price ($12,000), and also less than my maximum valuation ($12,000), I should accept Alice's offer to save money.
