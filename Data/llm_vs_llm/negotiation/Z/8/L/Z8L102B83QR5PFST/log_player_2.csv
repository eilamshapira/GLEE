"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'll analyze this situation carefully:

- The product is worth up to $12,000 to me (my maximum valuation)
- Alice values the product at $10,000 (her cost)
- Alice has offered to sell for $11,000
- John offers the same product for $12,000

Alice's offer is $1,000 less than my maximum valuation and $1,000 more than her cost. This is a fair middle ground, splitting the potential $2,000 surplus evenly. While I could reject and try to negotiate a lower price with a counteroffer, there's risk in that approach. 

Given that Alice's current offer already saves me $1,000 compared to buying from John, I'll accept this offer.
