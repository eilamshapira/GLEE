"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer of $20,000 because:
1. It's higher than my maximum value of $15,000
2. It's higher than John's guaranteed price of $15,000
3. I can make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better price from Alice"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 12000}

I'll offer $12,000 because:
1. It's below my maximum value of $15,000, which would give me some surplus value
2. It's significantly below John's price of $15,000, giving me potential savings
3. It leaves room for negotiation if Alice counters, as we still have several rounds remaining
4. It's a reasonable starting point that's not too low to be considered insulting, but low enough to potentially get a good deal"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer of $18,000 because:
1. It's still higher than my maximum value of $15,000
2. It's still higher than John's guaranteed price of $15,000
3. While Alice has reduced the price from $20,000 to $18,000, showing willingness to negotiate, the current offer is still not competitive with John's price
4. We still have several rounds left to negotiate, so I can try to get a better price through another counteroffer"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 13500}

I'll offer $13,500 because:
1. It's an increase from my previous offer of $12,000, showing I'm willing to negotiate upward
2. It's still below both my maximum value and John's price of $15,000
3. It's a meaningful increase (by $1,500) from my last offer, showing good faith in the negotiation
4. It gives Alice a chance to make a profit while still potentially saving me money compared to John's price
5. If Alice rejects this, I still have the option to either negotiate further or fall back on John's offer of $15,000"
