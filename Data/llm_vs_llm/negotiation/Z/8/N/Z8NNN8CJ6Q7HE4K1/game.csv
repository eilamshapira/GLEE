"Hello Bob, I have a product I'd like to offer you. It's a high-quality item that provides excellent value. I'm offering it for $150. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $150 is beyond my budget. I can offer $50 for the product.",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I can't accept $50 as it's significantly below the product's value. The product is worth at least $100 to me, and I'm confident you'll find it delivers excellent value. I can come down to $125. Does that work better for your budget?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your flexibility, Alice. I understand your position, but $125 is still above what I'm willing to spend. I can offer $70, considering my budget constraints.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but I can't go below $100 for this product. That's actually my bottom line, as I have another interested buyer willing to pay $100. I'd prefer to sell it to you if we can reach an agreement. Could you meet me at $110? That's still a significant discount from my initial offer.",110.0,Alice,5,
