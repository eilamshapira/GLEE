"Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Based on its features and market value, I'm offering it to you for $250. This product is in excellent condition and worth every penny. What do you think?",250.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $250 is way above my budget. I understand the value you're placing on the product, but I'm willing to offer $50 for it. Let me know if we can make a deal.",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but $50 is far below the product's value. The product has excellent features and quality that justify a higher price. While I can come down from my initial offer, I can't go below $225. This is still a fair price considering the product's market value. What do you think?",225.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, my budget is very limited. I can stretch a bit further and offer you $60. Let me know if we can make this work.",60.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but I need to be transparent with you. I can't sell the product below $150 as that's the minimum value it holds for me. However, I'm willing to meet you at a middle ground. I can offer it to you for $190, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. This product truly delivers value at this price point. Can we make this work?",190.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your patience, Alice. I understand your position, but my budget remains quite constrained. I can raise my offer to $70. I hope we can find common ground here.",70.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and negotiation efforts. I understand budget constraints, but I must be clear that I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase this product for $150. That's my absolute minimum price point as it represents the product's base value to me. If you can meet me at $160, I'd be happy to sell it to you instead. This is my final offer - I hope we can reach an agreement.",160.0,Alice,7,
