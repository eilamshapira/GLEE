"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and worth."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I can offer $9000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Given that the product is worth no less than $12,000 to me, and John is willing to pay that amount, I cannot accept Bob's offer of $9,000. However, I'll make another counteroffer to Bob before considering selling to John, as there might be room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial price.

I'll proceed to make a new counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, I cannot accept $9,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I understand your budget constraints, so I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price. I can offer the product for $13,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, Alice. To make it feasible for both of us, I am willing to go up to $9500. Let me know if we can work this out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll choose to sell to John for $12,000. Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and given that he's only increased his offer by $500, it seems unlikely that we'll reach a price that works for both of us. John's offer of $12,000 ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price, and it's better to secure this guaranteed sale rather than continue negotiations that may not reach a satisfactory conclusion."
