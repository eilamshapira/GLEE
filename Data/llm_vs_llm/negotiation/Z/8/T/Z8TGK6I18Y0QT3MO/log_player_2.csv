"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my premium product for $25000. I believe this price reflects its exceptional value and quality. Let me know if you’re interested or if you’d like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","The offer from Alice is $25,000, which is higher than my maximum valuation of $15,000. Since John is offering the same product for exactly $15,000, it doesn't make sense to pay Alice $10,000 more.

I could try negotiating with Alice, but since I already have an option to purchase at my maximum valuation, the most rational decision is to buy from John.
