"Bob, I have a truly unique product that I believe could be a game changer for you. I'm offering it to you first, as I see great potential for us to work together.  While the value of this product is significant, I'm open to discussing a fair price.  My starting offer is $1500000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you thinking of me for this product. However, I must be frank that $1500000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $1200000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product at that price. I'd prefer to do business with you, so I'm offering $975000. This would save me some money compared to my alternative option while giving you a chance to make the sale. What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,2,
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $975000 is a good offer, I need to make sure I'm getting fair value for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This would still be a substantial profit for you, and I'm confident it's a price that reflects the true value of this unique product. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've carefully considered your offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  While $975000 is below what I need to consider, I recognize your enthusiasm for this product.  I'm offering a final compromise of $1050000. This represents a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair and competitive price. I'm eager to close this deal, but I'm also committed to getting the right price for this valuable product. What's your final answer?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
