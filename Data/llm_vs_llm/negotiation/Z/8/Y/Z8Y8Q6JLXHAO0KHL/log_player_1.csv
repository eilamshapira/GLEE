While the value of this product is significant, I'm open to discussing a fair price.  My starting offer is $1,500,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you thinking of me for this product. However, I must be frank that $1500000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $1200000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product at that price. I'd prefer to do business with you, so I'm offering $975000. This would save me some money compared to my alternative option while giving you a chance to make the sale. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $975,000 is a good offer, I need to make sure I'm getting fair value for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would still be a substantial profit for you, and I'm confident it's a price that reflects the true value of this unique product. What do you say?""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I've carefully considered your offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  While $975,000 is below what I need to consider, I recognize your enthusiasm for this product.  I'm offering a final compromise of $1,050,000. This represents a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair and competitive price. I'm eager to close this deal, but I'm also committed to getting the right price for this valuable product. What's your final answer?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
