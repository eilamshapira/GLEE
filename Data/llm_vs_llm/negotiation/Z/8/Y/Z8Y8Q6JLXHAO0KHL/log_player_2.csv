"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a truly unique product that I believe could be a game changer for you. I'm offering it to you first, as I see great potential for us to work together.  While the value of this product is significant, I'm open to discussing a fair price.  My starting offer is $1500000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000, which exceeds the maximum value of $1,200,000 that the product is worth to me. There's no reason to pay more than the product's value to me.

Since John is willing to sell the same product for $1,200,000, and Alice's initial offer is higher than that, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal from Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you thinking of me for this product. However, I must be frank that $1,500,000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product at that price. I'd prefer to do business with you, so I'm offering $975,000. This would save me some money compared to my alternative option while giving you a chance to make the sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 975000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've carefully considered your offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  While $975000 is below what I need to consider, I recognize your enthusiasm for this product.  I'm offering a final compromise of $1050000. This represents a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair and competitive price. I'm eager to close this deal, but I'm also committed to getting the right price for this valuable product. What's your final answer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a good development. Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer of $1,500,000 to $1,050,000, which is now well below the $1,200,000 that the product is worth to me and what John is offering. 

If I accept this offer, I'll save $150,000 compared to buying from John. This is a very good deal, as it's well below my maximum valuation and gives me substantial savings.
