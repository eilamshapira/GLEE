"Hello Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $20000. This is a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $20000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. The product is only worth about $8000 to me, which is actually the price another seller (John) is offering right now. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you be willing to offer the product for $6500? This would give me a reason to choose your offer over the alternative.",6500.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. However, $6500 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price. I understand the product's value to you, but I need to maintain a fair price for my business. I'm willing to lower my offer to $18000, which still represents a great value for the quality you're getting. Let me know if this works for you.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your honesty about its value to you. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to reduce the price to $17000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my desire to do business with you. What are your thoughts on this new price?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for lowering your price, Alice, but $17000 is still well above what I can pay for this product. As I mentioned, the product is worth $8000 to me, which happens to be exactly what John is offering. For me to choose your offer over his, I would need a better price. I can offer $7500, which would save me money compared to John's offer while giving you a better deal than the $6500 I initially proposed. This is really the highest I can go considering the alternative I have available.",7500.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7500 is still below our minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down further to $16000, which is a substantial reduction from my previous offers. This price reflects my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. Please let me know if this is something you can consider.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're trying to find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop the price to $15500, which is very close to my bottom line. This offer shows my flexibility and eagerness to close the deal with you. What do you say?",15500.0,Alice,5,
