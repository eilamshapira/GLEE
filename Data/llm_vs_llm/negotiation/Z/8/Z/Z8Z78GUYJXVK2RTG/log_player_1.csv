Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $20000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. The product is only worth about $8000 to me, which is actually the price another seller (John) is offering right now. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you be willing to offer the product for $6500? This would give me a reason to choose your offer over the alternative. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. However, $6,500 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price. I understand the product's value to you, but I need to maintain a fair price for my business. I'm willing to lower my offer to $18,000, which still represents a great value for the quality you're getting. Let me know if this works for you.""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your honesty about its value to you.

What are your thoughts on this new price?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for lowering your price, Alice, but $17000 is still well above what I can pay for this product. As I mentioned, the product is worth $8000 to me, which happens to be exactly what John is offering. For me to choose your offer over his, I would need a better price. I can offer $7500, which would save me money compared to John's offer while giving you a better deal than the $6500 I initially proposed. This is really the highest I can go considering the alternative I have available. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is still below our minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down further to $16,000, which is a substantial reduction from my previous offers. This price reflects my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. Please let me know if this is something you can consider.""}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I see that we're trying to find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop the price to $15,500, which is very close to my bottom line.
