"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1000000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $1,000,000, I can see it exceeds the maximum value of $800,000 that the product is worth to me. Since I can buy the same product from John for exactly $800,000, which matches my maximum valuation, there's no reason to accept Alice's higher offer or continue negotiations.
