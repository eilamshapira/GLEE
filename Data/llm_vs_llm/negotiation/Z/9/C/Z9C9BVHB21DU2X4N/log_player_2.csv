"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm willing to let it go for a price that's slightly above its value to ensure I get a fair deal. If you're interested, please let me know. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. It makes sense to reject her offer and proceed with buying from John."
