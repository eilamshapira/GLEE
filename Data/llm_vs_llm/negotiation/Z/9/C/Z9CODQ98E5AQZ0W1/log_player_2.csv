"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer is way too high - it's $17,000 which is significantly above both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's alternative price ($12,000). I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer since Alice's initial price was quite high. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Alice and $12,000 to me, I'll start at the lower end.

{""product_price"": 11000}

This offer gives room for negotiation while still being not too far from my maximum price point of $12,000. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground, though I always have the option to go with John's offer of $12,000 if Alice won't come down enough from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice only reduced her price by $500, from $17,000 to $16,500, which is still way above both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's alternative price ($12,000). There's no reason to accept this offer when I can get the same product from John for $12,000. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round, but if Alice doesn't make a more substantial reduction, I'll likely end up buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but not by too much since I have John's $12,000 offer as a backup.

{""product_price"": 11500}

This offer shows some movement from my initial $11,000 but maintains a reasonable position given that I can always buy from John at $12,000. If Alice doesn't come down significantly in her next offer, I'll likely choose to buy from John rather than continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'm choosing to buy from John because:
1. Alice is still offering $16,000, which is far above my maximum value of $12,000
2. Alice's price reductions have been small ($17,000 → $16,500 → $16,000), suggesting she's unlikely to drop the price enough to beat John's offer
3. John's offer of $12,000 matches my maximum value and is clearly the better deal
4. Continuing to negotiate with Alice would likely just waste time since the gap between our positions is too large to bridge

Therefore, it's most rational to take John's guaranteed offer of $12,000 now."
