Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. While $120 is better than selling to John for $100, I know the product is worth $150 to Bob, so there's still room for negotiation to reach a more mutually beneficial price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $125. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.

I'll accept Bob's offer of $125. It's a reasonable compromise and significantly better than the alternative of selling to John for $100. While it's below my initial target, it's a fair price that provides good value for both parties."
