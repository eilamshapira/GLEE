"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I need to consider an appropriate price for the product that is higher than my minimum threshold of $12,000, while allowing room for potential negotiation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I see that Bob's initial offer is quite low at $5,000, which is significantly below my minimum threshold of $12,000. Since I have the guaranteed option to sell to John for $12,000, I'll make a more reasonable counteroffer but still leave room for negotiation.
