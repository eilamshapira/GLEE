"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $6000.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $6000 is significantly below the product's value. I can lower my initial offer to $12500, which is much more reasonable considering the product's worth.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12500 is still too high. I can go up to $7500.  This is a serious offer, and I think it's a fair price.",7500.0,Bob,4,
