"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great fit for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $6000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll counter with a more reasonable price but still maintain value:

{""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $6,000 is significantly below the product's value. I can lower my initial offer to $12,500, which is much more reasonable considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $6,000 is significantly below the product's value. I can lower my initial offer to $12,500, which is much more reasonable considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12500 is still too high. I can go up to $7500.  This is a serious offer, and I think it's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and he seems reluctant to reach a price point that would be profitable for me, I'll take John's guaranteed offer of $10,000. This ensures I get my minimum desired value for the product without further negotiation risk."
