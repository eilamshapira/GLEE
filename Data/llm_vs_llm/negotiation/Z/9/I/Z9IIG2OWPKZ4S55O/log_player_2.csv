"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,000,000 and also higher than John's price. It would be better to either negotiate with Alice for a lower price or buy from John. Since we have 10 rounds to negotiate, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 800000}

I'll make a counteroffer of $800,000. This is below Alice's known value of $1,000,000 but provides room for negotiation. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground, and I still have the option to buy from John at $1,000,000 if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,500,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value and John's price of $1,000,000. While Alice has reduced the price from the initial $1,900,000, it's still not competitive with John's offer. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. If we can't reach a reasonable agreement soon, buying from John will be the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 900000}

I'll increase my offer to $900,000. This is still below Alice's known value of $1,000,000 but shows I'm willing to move up from my previous offer. It's also below John's price, which would save money for both parties if accepted. If Alice continues to insist on prices above $1,000,000, I'll likely need to consider taking John's offer instead of continuing negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John for $1,000,000. Here's why:
1. Alice's offers, while decreasing, are still significantly above John's price
2. Alice has rejected reasonable counteroffers below $1,000,000
3. Alice's current offer of $1,300,000 is still well above my maximum value and John's price
4. Even though we have more rounds available, Alice's rate of price reduction suggests we're unlikely to reach a price below John's $1,000,000 offer
5. Continuing negotiations would just waste time when we have a guaranteed option at my maximum acceptable price

Therefore, it's most rational to take John's offer now at $1,000,000."
