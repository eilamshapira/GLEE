"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18000 is quite high for this product. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $11500. This is a fair price that would still provide you with a reasonable profit.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget, but $11500 is too low. Considering the product's value and the effort I put in, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $17000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
