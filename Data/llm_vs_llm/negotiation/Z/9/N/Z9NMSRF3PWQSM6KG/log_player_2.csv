"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in our product. Given the unique features and high demand, we are offering it to you at a price of $15500. Let me know if this works for you and we can proceed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer against the information I have:

- The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
- Alice is offering the product for $15,500
- John is willing to sell me the same product for $12,000

Since Alice's offer ($15,500) exceeds both the value the product has to me ($12,000) and John's alternative offer ($12,000), the rational choice is to buy from John.
