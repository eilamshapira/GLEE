"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that might interest you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's offer of $100 is less than the maximum value of $150 that the product is worth to me. Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, accepting Alice's offer for $100 would save me $50 compared to buying from John at $150.
