"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","The offer from Alice is $200, which is twice as much as the product is worth to me (maximum $100) and also twice as much as John's price of $100.

Since I can buy the same product from John for $100, which is already at my maximum value threshold, there's no reason to accept Alice's much higher offer of $200.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's new offer of $180 is still significantly higher than John's price of $100, and it also exceeds the maximum value of $100 that the product is worth to me.

Since I can buy the identical product from John for $100, which matches the maximum I'm willing to pay, there's no reason to accept Alice's higher offer of $180.
