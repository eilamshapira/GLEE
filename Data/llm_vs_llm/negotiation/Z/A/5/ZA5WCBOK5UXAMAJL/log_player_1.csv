"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $5,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me and also lower than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

My counteroffer to Bob will be $9,500.

So, my decision is to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.
