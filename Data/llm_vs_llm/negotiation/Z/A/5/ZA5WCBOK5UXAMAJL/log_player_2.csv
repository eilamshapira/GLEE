"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's initial offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay, and I have the option to buy the same product from John for the same price, I see no advantage in accepting Alice's offer immediately. However, I also don't want to give up the potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. Therefore, the best strategy is to reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer, hoping to negotiate a lower price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable, considering the product's value to me. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a lower price and see how Alice responds.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has made a concession from her initial offer of $10,000 to $9,500, which indicates she is willing to negotiate. Since my goal is to buy the product for the lowest price possible, and $9,500 is still $500 less than what I could get it from John, I see this as a positive development. However, I believe there might be room for further negotiation.

Given that Alice has already dropped her price by $500, I'm inclined to think she might be willing to go a bit lower, especially since I've shown willingness to walk away by rejecting her previous offer and considering buying from John. Therefore, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, aiming to split the difference between my previous offer and Alice's current offer, or slightly better for me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my next counteroffer would be $8,000, trying to meet somewhere in the middle but leaning towards saving more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has further reduced the price from $9,500 to $9,000, showing she's willing to continue negotiating. This price is $1,000 less than what John is offering, which is a significant savings. Considering Alice's willingness to lower the price, I believe she might be getting close to her limit, but there's still a possibility she could go a bit lower.

However, the difference between $9,000 and my previous offer of $8,000 is only $1,000, and given that I'm already saving $1,000 compared to buying from John, I need to weigh the potential savings against the risk of losing the deal altogether.

At this point, I'm inclined to accept Alice's offer of $9,000 because it represents a good balance between saving money and the risk of further negotiation. The potential savings from further negotiation might not be significant enough to warrant the risk of Alice deciding not to sell to me at all.
