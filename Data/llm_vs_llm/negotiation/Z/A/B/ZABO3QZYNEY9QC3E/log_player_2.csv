"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
2. Alice's offer of $25,000 is more than twice my maximum value
3. John is offering the product for $12,000, which matches my maximum value

Alice's offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's alternative price. While I could try to negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, the large gap between her initial offer ($25,000) and my maximum value ($12,000) suggests she might be expecting a much higher price than I'm willing to pay.

Since John's offer matches my maximum value and is less than half of Alice's asking price, the most rational decision would be to:
