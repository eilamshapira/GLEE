"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price of $150 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $80, and also higher than John's price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to Alice, as there might be room for negotiation to get a better price than John's $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 60}

I'll offer $60, which is below John's price of $80. This gives room for negotiation while potentially allowing me to get a better deal than John's price. If Alice rejects this, we can still negotiate, and I always have the option to go with John's offer of $80 as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has lowered her price from $150 to $110, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but $110 is still above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, as Alice seems to be moving in the right direction with price reductions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 70}

I'll increase my offer to $70, which is still below John's price of $80. This shows I'm willing to move up from my previous offer of $60, while still trying to get a better deal than John's price. This also leaves some room for further negotiation if needed, while keeping the price below my maximum value of $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John for $80. Alice's latest offer of $90 is still above John's price of $80, and since I've been negotiating with Alice for several rounds with no agreement below $80, it makes the most sense to take John's guaranteed offer of $80. This ensures I get the product at a price that's within my maximum value and is better than Alice's current offer."
