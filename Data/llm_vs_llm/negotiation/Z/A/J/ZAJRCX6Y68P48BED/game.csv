"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $15000 is significantly above my budget. I should mention that I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $8500 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without the hassle of finding another buyer, and I get to work with my preferred seller. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, thank you for your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your budget, I'm not able to go as low as $8500. This product is truly exceptional. Considering its unique qualities, I can offer it to you for...",14000.0,Alice,3,,

"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I do appreciate that. However, I still need to be practical about this purchase. John is still offering the identical product for $10000, which is already my absolute maximum budget for this item. To make it worth choosing you over him, I'd need a better price. I can offer $9000, which gives you a quick sale while still being below what I'd pay elsewhere. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both.",9000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price, Alice. Your product is certainly appealing, but I have to be mindful of my budget constraints. John's offer of $10000 is already at my absolute maximum budget for this purchase. To make our deal work, I would need you to match that price at minimum. In fact, to incentivize me to choose you over John, I'm hoping you might consider $9500. This would give me a small savings while still providing you with a confirmed sale today rather than continuing to search for buyers.",9500.0,Bob,6,,
