Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I'm looking for a serious buyer, and based on your interest, I believe you'd appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for a price of..."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $15000 is significantly above my budget. I should mention that I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $8500 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without the hassle of finding another buyer, and I get to work with my preferred seller. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Okay, Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I have to make a decision. Considering the situation, I choose to counteroffer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your budget, I'm not able to go as low as $8,500. This product is truly exceptional. Considering its unique qualities, I can offer it to you for..."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I do appreciate that. However, I still need to be practical about this purchase. John is still offering the identical product for $10000, which is already my absolute maximum budget for this item. To make it worth choosing you over him, I'd need a better price. I can offer $9000, which gives you a quick sale while still being below what I'd pay elsewhere. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a tough spot. Bob's offer is still below my minimum. However, he's clearly indicating $10,000 is his absolute ceiling, and he's using John as leverage. I have to decide if I want to risk losing the sale entirely. I could try to go higher, but I risk him walking away.

I think I'll try one more counteroffer, but I will go lower than my initial offers.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand you have another offer for $10,000. To make this work for both of us, considering the value I know this product provides, I am willing to reduce the price to..."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price, Alice. Your product is certainly appealing, but I have to be mindful of my budget constraints. John's offer of $10000 is already at my absolute maximum budget for this purchase. To make our deal work, I would need you to match that price at minimum. In fact, to incentivize me to choose you over John, I'm hoping you might consider $9500. This would give me a small savings while still providing you with a confirmed sale today rather than continuing to search for buyers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a critical decision point. Bob is explicitly stating $10,000 is his limit and the value to him. He even tried to get me to go lower. I have to consider my minimum acceptable price is $10,000.

Given that the potential profit from selling to Bob is far less than what I can get from selling to John, I should sell to John.
