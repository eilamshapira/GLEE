# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to consider my options carefully. Alice is offering the product for $15,000, but it's worth no more than $10,000 to me. Meanwhile, John is willing to sell it for $10,000.

Since Alice's asking price is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation and John's alternative price, it doesn't make sense to accept her current offer.

I should mention that I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $10,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without the hassle of finding another buyer, and I get to work with my preferred seller.

Alice's offer:

John is still offering the identical product for $10,000, which is already my absolute maximum budget for this item. To make it worth choosing you over him, I'd need a better price. I can offer $9,000, which gives you a quick sale while still being below what I'd pay elsewhere. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 9000}"

Your product is certainly appealing, but I have to be mindful of my budget constraints. John's offer of $10,000 is already at my absolute maximum budget for this purchase. To make our deal work, I would need you to match that price at minimum. In fact, to incentivize me to choose you over John, I'm hoping you might consider $9,500. This would give me a small savings while still providing you with a confirmed sale today rather than continuing to search for buyers."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
