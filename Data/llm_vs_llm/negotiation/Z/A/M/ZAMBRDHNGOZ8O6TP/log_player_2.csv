"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: $1,500,000
   - This is above my maximum value ($1,200,000)
   - Would result in negative value for me

2. Reject Alice's offer and buy from John: $1,200,000
   - This price equals my maximum value
   - This is a better option than Alice's offer
   - I know John will sell at this price

Given that:
- Alice's price ($1,500,000) is above my maximum value ($1,200,000)
- John's price ($1,200,000) equals my maximum value
- I need the product

The rational decision is to buy from John.
