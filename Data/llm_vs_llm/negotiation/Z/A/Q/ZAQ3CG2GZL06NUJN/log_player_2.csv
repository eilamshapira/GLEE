"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $140. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product is worth up to $150 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering it for $140
3. John's fixed price is $150
4. If I reject Alice's offer, I can still negotiate with her or go to John

Alice's offer at $140 is better than John's price at $150, saving me $10. However, since the product is only worth $120 to Alice, there might be room for negotiation if I reject this first offer.

Given that I want to save as much money as possible, I should:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting because:
1. Alice has room to lower the price (since it's worth $120 to her)
2. I still have John as a backup option at $150
3. This rejection might lead Alice to offer a better price in the next round"
