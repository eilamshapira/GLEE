"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer to see if we can meet at a mutually beneficial price. 

My counteroffer: $1000000"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you have a certain budget in mind, but I believe the product's value is higher than $600,000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Here's a revised offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to propose a price of $800000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer, considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

I accept Bob's offer of $800,000. Since this is my minimum acceptable price and Bob is willing to meet me at this price, I don't see a need to continue negotiating or risk losing the sale by trying to get a higher price. Additionally, selling to Bob at this price is equivalent to selling to John, but it shows that I was able to negotiate and agree on a price with Bob, which can be beneficial for future dealings."
