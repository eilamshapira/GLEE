"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's initial offer is at the maximum value I'm willing to pay, and I have the option to buy the product from John for the same price, I don't see any benefit in accepting Alice's offer immediately. I'd like to try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, to test the waters and see how willing she is to negotiate.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the market value of similar products."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you have a certain budget in mind, but I believe the product's value is higher than $600000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Here's a revised offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's revised offer is still quite high, but it's a step in the right direction. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.

Since Alice's offer is $1,000,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between her offer and my previous counteroffer of $600,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

(I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To meet Alice halfway between her offer of $1,000,000 and my previous counteroffer of $600,000, I'll calculate the midpoint: ($1,000,000 + $600,000) / 2 = $800,000.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to propose a price of $800,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer, considering the product's value and the market conditions."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
