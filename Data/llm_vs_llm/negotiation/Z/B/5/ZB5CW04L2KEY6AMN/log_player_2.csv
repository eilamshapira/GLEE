"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $11500. This is a one-time offer, and I believe you'll find it's a great value for what you're getting. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer of $11,500, reject it, or buy from John for $12,000.

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me.
- Alice's offer: $11,500
- John's price: $12,000

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is $500 less than John's price, the rational choice is to accept Alice's offer.
