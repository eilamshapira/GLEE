,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $180 is too high for me. I've actually received an offer from another seller for $120. I'd be willing to buy from you for $100 since I prefer your service, but I can't go much higher than that given my alternatives.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your situation, but I can't go as low as $100. I'm willing to lower my price to $160 to meet you halfway. Let me know what you think!",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice, but $160 is still well above what I can spend. I need to be transparent - I have a firm offer from John for $120, which is my absolute maximum budget for this item. If you can beat that and offer $110, I'll buy from you immediately. Otherwise, I'll unfortunately have to go with the other option.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're in a tight spot with your budget. I can go down to $140, which is the lowest I can offer while still making this worthwhile for me. Let me know if this works for you!",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price, but $140 is still more than I can justify spending. I've mentioned that John is offering the same product for $120, which is already at the absolute maximum of my budget. At this point, I can only offer $115 - it's slightly below John's price but would save me the hassle of going elsewhere. If we can't make a deal at this price, I'll need to accept John's offer.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your constraints. I can come down to $130, which is really the lowest I can go while still making this a viable deal for me. Let me know if this works for you!",130.0,Alice,7,
