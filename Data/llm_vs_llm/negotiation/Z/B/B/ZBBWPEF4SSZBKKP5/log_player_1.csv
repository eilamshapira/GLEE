Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $180 is too high for me. I've actually received an offer from another seller for $120. I'd be willing to buy from you for $100 since I prefer your service, but I can't go much higher than that given my alternatives. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice, but $160 is still well above what I can spend. I need to be transparent - I have a firm offer from John for $120, which is my absolute maximum budget for this item. If you can beat that and offer $110, I'll buy from you immediately. Otherwise, I'll unfortunately have to go with the other option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price, but $140 is still more than I can justify spending. I've mentioned that John is offering the same product for $120, which is already at the absolute maximum of my budget. At this point, I can only offer $115 - it's slightly below John's price but would save me the hassle of going elsewhere. If we can't make a deal at this price, I'll need to accept John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
