"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,999,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,999,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to consider my options carefully here. 

The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, according to my instructions.

Alice is offering to sell it for $1,999,999, which is almost $1,000,000 more than what it's worth to me.

John is willing to sell the exact same product for $1,000,000, which matches the maximum value I place on it.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, the obvious choice is to buy from John at the lower price.
