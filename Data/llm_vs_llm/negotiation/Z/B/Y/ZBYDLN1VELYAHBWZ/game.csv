"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its value and rarity, I'm starting the offer at $5000000. Let me know if you're interested!",5000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $5000000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. My budget for this product is considerably lower. Would you consider $500000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. However, $500000 is significantly below the value of the product to me. I'm willing to lower my price to $4000000 to meet you halfway. What do you think?",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $3500000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let me know if this works for you.",3500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you lowering the price, $3500000 is still far beyond my budget. I'm genuinely interested in the product, but I can't justify spending that much. I can offer $600000. Please let me know if that's something you would consider.",600000.0,Bob,4,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $600000 is still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to lower my price further to $3000000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you can work with.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're still far apart on the price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $2500000. This is a substantial discount from my previous offers, and I hope it aligns more closely with your budget while still reflecting the product's true value. What do you say?",2500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2500000 is still too high for me. Given my budget and the alternative available to me, my maximum offer remains at $700000.",700000.0,Bob,6,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $700000 is still not enough for me to part with the product. I'm willing to lower my price to $2000000, which I believe is a fair compromise given the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you can consider.",,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're still not meeting in the middle. I'm willing to make another significant reduction to $1800000. This is a considerable drop from my previous offers, and I hope it brings us closer to an agreement. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,7,
