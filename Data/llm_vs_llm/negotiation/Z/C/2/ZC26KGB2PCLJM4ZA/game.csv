"Hello Bob, I have a quality product that I'm offering for sale. I believe it provides excellent value. Given its features and condition, I'm pricing it at $120. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and your counteroffer. I appreciate that you're considering my product. While $85 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm not able to go quite that low considering the quality and value of the item. I could come down to $110, which is already a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think about that?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down on the price.  $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $95.  This is a fair price considering the value I'm getting, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase.",95.0,Bob,4,
