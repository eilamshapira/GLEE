Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and your counteroffer. I appreciate that you're considering my product. While $85 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm not able to go quite that low considering the quality and value of the item. I could come down to $110, which is already a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think about that?
