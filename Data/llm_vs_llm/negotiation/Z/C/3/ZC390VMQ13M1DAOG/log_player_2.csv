"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer is $150, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, and buying from John would also cost me $150, I don't see any benefit in rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John. However, I would like to try to negotiate a better price with Alice. But since I have to choose from the given options, I will reject Alice's offer to see if she can offer a better price.
