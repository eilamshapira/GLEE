"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $1400000 is quite high considering market conditions. The product is valuable to me, but I need to be prudent with my investment. I'm prepared to offer $1150000, which I believe is fair and would allow both of us to benefit from this transaction. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to reaching an agreement that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the market conditions. While $1150000 is below my initial offer, it is a good starting point for further negotiation.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000, which reflects a significant compromise on my end. I believe this price remains fair considering the product's unique value to you. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
