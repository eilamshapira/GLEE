"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be an excellent investment for you. Given its market value and potential returns, I'm offering it at $1450000. This price reflects the product's quality and value proposition.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget. I'm prepared to offer $1000000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I must be transparent - your offer is below my minimum acceptable price. The product has proven market value, and I already have another buyer willing to pay $1200000. However, I know this product would be more valuable to you, so I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price. I can offer it for $1375000, which still provides you significant potential for return on investment.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1375000 is still above my current budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market and potential returns.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but I need to be direct - I have a guaranteed buyer at $1200000, so I cannot accept anything below that price. However, I know this product would generate more value in your hands. I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial ask - I can offer it for $1300000. This price point would still allow you to realize a substantial return on your investment, given the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you have another buyer, but I'm serious about acquiring this product.  I'm willing to move to $1200000.  This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you matching my alternative offer of $1200000, which demonstrates your serious interest. However, given that this product would provide you with significantly more value, I believe we can find a middle ground that benefits us both. I'm willing to reduce my price further to $1250000. This represents a very reasonable split of the additional value you'd gain from the product, while still being considerably below my initial asking price.",1250000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, $1200000 is my absolute best offer. If you can't accept that, I'll have to go with John.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
