"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be an excellent investment for you.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget. I'm prepared to offer $1000000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and even below what John is willing to pay. I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I must be transparent - your offer is below my minimum acceptable price. The product has proven market value, and I already have another buyer willing to pay $1,200,000. However, I know this product would be more valuable to you, so I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price. I can offer it for $1,375,000, which still provides you significant potential for return on investment."", ""product_price"": 1375000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1375000 is still above my current budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market and potential returns. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll continue negotiating with Bob. While his offer has increased, it's still below John's offer of $1,200,000. Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, there should be room for a deal that's more profitable than John's standing offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but I need to be direct - I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, so I cannot accept anything below that price. However, I know this product would generate more value in your hands. I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial ask - I can offer it for $1,300,000. This price point would still allow you to realize a substantial return on your investment, given the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have another buyer, but I'm serious about acquiring this product.  I'm willing to move to $1200000.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make another counteroffer. Since Bob claims this is his ""final offer"" but he values the product at $1,500,000, and we still have more rounds to negotiate, I believe there's still room to achieve a better price. The fact that he matched John's offer shows he's willing to move up significantly from his initial position, suggesting he might be willing to go higher despite claiming this is his final offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you matching my alternative offer of $1,200,000, which demonstrates your serious interest. However, given that this product would provide you with significantly more value, I believe we can find a middle ground that benefits us both. I'm willing to reduce my price further to $1,250,000. This represents a very reasonable split of the additional value you'd gain from the product, while still being considerably below my initial asking price."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1200000 is my absolute best offer. If you can't accept that, I'll have to go with John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,200,000. Given that Bob has remained firm at this price point for multiple rounds and is threatening to walk away, and that this price matches my alternative option with John, it's best to conclude the deal now. While I hoped to capture more of the additional value Bob would gain from the product, continuing to push might risk losing the sale altogether."
