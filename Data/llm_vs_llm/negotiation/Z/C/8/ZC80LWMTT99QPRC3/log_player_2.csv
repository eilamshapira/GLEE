Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I must be transparent - your offer is below my minimum acceptable price. The product has proven market value, and I already have another buyer willing to pay $1200000. However, I know this product would be more valuable to you, so I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price. I can offer it for $1375000, which still provides you significant potential for return on investment.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but I need to be direct - I have a guaranteed buyer at $1200000, so I cannot accept anything below that price. However, I know this product would generate more value in your hands. I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial ask - I can offer it for $1300000. This price point would still allow you to realize a substantial return on your investment, given the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you matching my alternative offer of $1200000, which demonstrates your serious interest. However, given that this product would provide you with significantly more value, I believe we can find a middle ground that benefits us both. I'm willing to reduce my price further to $1250000. This represents a very reasonable split of the additional value you'd gain from the product, while still being considerably below my initial asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
