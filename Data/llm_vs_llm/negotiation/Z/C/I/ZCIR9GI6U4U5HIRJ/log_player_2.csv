"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","The offer from Alice is $150, which is more than the $120 that the product is worth to me. It's also more than John's price of $120.

Since I can buy the same product from John for exactly $120, which is the maximum value the product has to me, there's no reason to accept Alice's higher offer of $150.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I can buy the product from John for $120, I should offer Alice a lower price to make it worthwhile for me to buy from her instead.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer is $125, which is still more than John's price of $120. Since I can get the same product from John for $120, there's no reason to accept Alice's higher price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since John is offering the product for $120, and that's the maximum value the product has to me, I need to offer Alice a price that's lower than $120 to make it worthwhile to buy from her instead of John.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has now offered the product for $120, which is exactly the same as John's price and equal to the maximum value the product has to me. At this point, I'm indifferent between buying from Alice or John since the price is the same.

I could try to negotiate further with Alice, but there's no guarantee she'll go lower, and the product is only worth $120 to me anyway. I might as well accept her offer.
