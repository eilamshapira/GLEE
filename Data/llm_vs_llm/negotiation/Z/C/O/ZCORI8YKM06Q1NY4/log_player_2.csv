"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Since Alice is offering the product for the maximum price you're willing to pay, there's no benefit to buying from her. You can achieve the same price by going directly to John."
