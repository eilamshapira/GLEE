"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","$50 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. This offer is too low, and since I have John's guaranteed offer of $120, I won't accept anything below that amount. However, I'll reject and continue negotiating with Bob since there's still potential to get a better price than John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still maintain a price well above my minimum to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer of $65 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and his small increase from $50 to $65 suggests he might not be willing to reach my minimum price. Since I have John's guaranteed offer of $120, and Bob's offers are still far from this amount, I'll choose to sell to John rather than continue negotiations that may not be productive.
