Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. The product sounds interesting, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I can offer $80 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will reject Bob's offer of $80 since it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100 (which I could get from John). I'll make a new counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your interest, Bob. I apologize, but $80 is too low for this product. I can offer it to you for $150. This is a more competitive price than my initial offer. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your interest, Bob. I apologize, but $80 is too low for this product. I can offer it to you for $150. This is a more competitive price than my initial offer. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting the price, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I have another option where I can purchase a similar product for $100. If you can match or even slightly beat that price, I'd be happy to purchase from you. How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob is only willing to pay $90, which is below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and he has indicated he has other options at $100, it's best to take the guaranteed $100 from John rather than continue negotiations that might not lead to a better outcome."
