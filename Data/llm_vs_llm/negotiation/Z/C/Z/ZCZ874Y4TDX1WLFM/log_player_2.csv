"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering a product that I believe could be incredibly valuable to your business.  I'm asking for $950000 for it, but I'm confident it's worth more than that to the right buyer. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up at $800000, but I think you'll see the potential here. Let's chat and discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $1,000,000
2. Alice's offer is $950,000
3. John's fixed price is $1,000,000
4. Alice mentioned she has another buyer at $800,000 (though this could be a negotiation tactic)

Since Alice's offer ($950,000) is:
- Below my maximum value ($1,000,000)
- Less than John's price ($1,000,000)
- Would save me $50,000 compared to buying from John

Even though Alice might be willing to go lower (given the mention of another buyer at $800,000), accepting her current offer would still save me money compared to buying from John.
