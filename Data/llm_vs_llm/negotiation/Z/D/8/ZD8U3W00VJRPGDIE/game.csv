"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer! I'm still very interested in the product. How about we meet at $62.50? It's a bit closer to your price, but still a good deal for both of us.",62.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $62.50 is still too low. I'm willing to come down to $70. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think.",70.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you! $66 is still a little too low. How about we split the difference and go with $68? That way we both get a decent deal, and I can get this product into your hands. What do you say?",68.0,Alice,7,
