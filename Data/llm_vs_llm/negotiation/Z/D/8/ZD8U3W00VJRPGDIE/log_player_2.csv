"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in! I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's initial offer is $100, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, I don't see any benefit in accepting the offer immediately. I'd like to try to negotiate a better price. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, to see how she responds. Since I don't know the value of the product to Alice, I'll start with a relatively low price.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 50}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! $50 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $75?  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's counteroffer of $75 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Since we're negotiating, I'd like to try to bring the price down further. I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to split the difference between my previous offer of $50 and Alice's counteroffer of $75. This way, I'm showing that I'm willing to compromise, but still trying to get a better deal.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer! I'm still very interested in the product. How about we meet at $62.50? It's a bit closer to your price, but still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 62.50}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $62.50 is still too low. I'm willing to come down to $70. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's offer of $70 is getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since she's willing to come down from $75 to $70, I'll try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to meet Alice halfway between her latest offer of $70 and my previous offer of $62.50. This shows that I'm still interested in the product and willing to compromise.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $70! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet at $66? It's a bit closer to your price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 66}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you! $66 is still a little too low. How about we split the difference and go with $68? That way we both get a decent deal, and I can get this product into your hands. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $68. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $68
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's offer of $68 is very close to a price I'm comfortable with. At this point, I'm not sure if I can get a better deal, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy the product from Alice. Since $68 is only $32 away from my maximum budget of $100, and it's a significant discount from the original price, I think it's a good deal.
