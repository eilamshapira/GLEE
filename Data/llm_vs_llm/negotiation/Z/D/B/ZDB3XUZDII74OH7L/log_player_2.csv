"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm really excited to offer you this unique product. Considering its value and scarcity, I'm willing to let it go for $14000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to drop the price further before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value, $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate you seeing the value. Given the product's exclusivity, I can't go down to $12000. However, to close this deal, I am willing to offer it to you for $13000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price.  $13,000 is a good compromise, and it's still significantly cheaper than buying from John. Accepting this offer is the best choice in this situation."
