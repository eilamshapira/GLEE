"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $170. It's a great deal considering its quality and features. Let me know what you think!",170.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $60 for the product. Let me know if that works for you!",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. $60 is a bit too low for me, as the product is worth significantly more. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $160.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Alice. I understand it's valuable to you, but $160 is still too high for me. How about we try $70? I think that's a fair price considering my budget constraints.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued interest, Bob. $70 is still below what I can accept. Let's try $150. That's a significant drop from my initial offer, and I think it's a very reasonable price.",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down to $150, Alice. However, it's still beyond what I'm looking to spend. Could you consider $75? I think that's a fair compromise and it's closer to the middle ground.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm also running a business here. $75 is simply not sustainable for me. Let's try $140. It's a further reduction, and I'm really trying to work with you.",140.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts to work with me, Alice. $140 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $80? That's the maximum I can go, and it's still a good deal for both of us.",80.0,Bob,8,
