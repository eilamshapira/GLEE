"Hello Bob! I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is quite high for my budget. Based on my market research and needs, I can offer $90 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is below my minimum acceptable price. The product's quality and market value are significantly higher. I can come down to $150, which is already a considerable reduction from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true value of the product while still giving you a good deal.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $150 is still more than I can justify spending. Given that I can find similar products in the market for around $120, I can offer $105. This is a fair price that would benefit both of us, and I'm ready to make the purchase immediately at this price.",105.0,Bob,4,
