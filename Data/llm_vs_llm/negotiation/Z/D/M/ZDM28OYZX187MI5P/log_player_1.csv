"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is quite high for my budget. Based on my market research and needs, I can offer $90 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer in the next round because:
1. Bob's offer of $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100
2. I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate
3. I can always fall back to John's offer of $100 if needed
4. Bob's willingness to negotiate suggests there might be room for a better deal"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is below my minimum acceptable price. The product's quality and market value are significantly higher. I can come down to $150, which is already a considerable reduction from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true value of the product while still giving you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $150 is still more than I can justify spending. Given that I can find similar products in the market for around $120, I can offer $105. This is a fair price that would benefit both of us, and I'm ready to make the purchase immediately at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I accept Bob's offer of $105 because:
1. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $100
2. It's better than John's guaranteed offer of $100
3. Bob has shown he's negotiating in good faith and has made a reasonable argument about market prices
4. While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk Bob might withdraw or lower his offer, and we're already getting a fair price"
