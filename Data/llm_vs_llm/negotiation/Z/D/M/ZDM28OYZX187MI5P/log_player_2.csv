"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given that my maximum value for the product is $120 and John is willing to sell it at exactly $120, Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. Since Alice's initial offer is $60 more than my maximum value, I should reject it and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably below my maximum value to leave room for negotiation, but not so low that it would offend Alice.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is quite high for my budget. Based on my market research and needs, I can offer $90 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is below my minimum acceptable price. The product's quality and market value are significantly higher. I can come down to $150, which is already a considerable reduction from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true value of the product while still giving you a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $150 is still above both my maximum value ($120) and John's guaranteed price ($120). Since I can get the same product from John for $120, there's no reason to accept a higher price. I'll reject and try one more counteroffer, but if Alice doesn't come down significantly, I should consider buying from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $150 is still more than I can justify spending. Given that I can find similar products in the market for around $120, I can offer $105. This is a fair price that would benefit both of us, and I'm ready to make the purchase immediately at this price."", ""product_price"": 105}"
