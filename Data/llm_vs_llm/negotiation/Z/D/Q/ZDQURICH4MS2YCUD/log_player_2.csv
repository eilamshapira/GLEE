"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: Since Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's price ($1,500,000), it makes sense to reject and make a counteroffer. There's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice, while John's price can always serve as a fallback option. By making a counteroffer, we have nothing to lose and potentially something to gain through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1000000}

Rationale: I'll start with a significantly lower offer at $1,000,000, which is about 33% lower than both Alice's offer and John's price. This gives room for negotiation while still being a reasonable starting point. If Alice rejects this, we can gradually increase our offer in subsequent rounds, and we still have John's $1,500,000 price as a backup option. This approach gives us the best chance to save money while maintaining a credible negotiating position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Rationale: Alice has significantly reduced her price from $1,500,000 to $1,300,000, which is a $200,000 savings compared to both her initial offer and John's price. This is a substantial reduction that represents good value. While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might become less flexible or withdraw from negotiations, forcing us to pay $1,500,000 to John. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush - accepting this offer guarantees us a significant saving of $200,000, which is a good outcome for the negotiation."
