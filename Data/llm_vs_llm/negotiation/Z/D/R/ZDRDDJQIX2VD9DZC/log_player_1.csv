Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to set a price for my product that maximizes my potential earnings while considering Bob's likely acceptance threshold.

If I set the price too high, Bob might reject it, and I'll end up selling to John for $8,000. If I set the price too low, I'll be leaving money on the table.

Since I have a guaranteed backup offer of $8,000 from John, that's my minimum acceptable outcome. I should offer Bob a price higher than $8,000 to potentially increase my earnings.

Without knowing Bob's maximum willingness to pay, I'll choose a price that's reasonably higher than my floor value but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected.
