"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a perfect fit for you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a competitive price considering the product's true worth and potential. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to think about the best decision here:

1. The product is worth at most $1,200,000 to me.
2. Alice's offer is $1,500,000, which exceeds what the product is worth to me.
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $1,200,000.

Since Alice's price is higher than both the product's value to me and John's alternative offer, I should buy from John.
