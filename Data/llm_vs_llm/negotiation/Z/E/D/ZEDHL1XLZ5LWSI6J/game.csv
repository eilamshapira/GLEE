"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob! I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $150? I think that’s a fair price for such a great product. Let me know!",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $150 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $90, which is the highest I'm comfortable paying. Would you consider selling it to me for that price?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your flexibility, Bob! I understand your budget constraints. How about I lower the price to $130? I believe it’s a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know!",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the lower price, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, though. How about $95? That's as high as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",95.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your continued interest, Bob! I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $95. How about $120? I think that's a reasonable price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,7,
