"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $150
2. Alice's offer is $140
3. I can buy from John for $150
4. Alice's cost is $120, so there's room for negotiation

Since this is just the first round and Alice's initial offer is closer to my maximum value than her cost, I should try to negotiate for a better price. The $140 offer isn't bad, but I can likely get a better deal since Alice has room to go lower (her cost is $120).

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Let me make a strategic counteroffer:

Since Alice's cost is $120 and she offered $140, I'll propose a price that's closer to the middle ground but still gives her a reasonable profit. I'll offer $130, which would give her a $10 profit while saving me $20 compared to her initial offer (and $20 compared to John's price).

{""product_price"": 130}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has moved down from her initial $140 to $135
2. This is $5 higher than my counteroffer of $130
3. I'm saving $15 compared to John's price
4. We're only in round 3 of 10, but the negotiations seem to be moving in a positive direction
5. $135 is a reasonable price, giving Alice a $15 profit while saving me $15 compared to my alternative

While I could try to negotiate further, $135 is a fair price that's well below my maximum value of $150. The difference between this and my last offer ($130) is relatively small, and there's a risk that prolonged negotiation might not yield much better results.

I'll accept this offer.
