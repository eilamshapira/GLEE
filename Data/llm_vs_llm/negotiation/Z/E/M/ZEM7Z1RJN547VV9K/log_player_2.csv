You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","The offer of $200 is way above my maximum value of $120. I will not accept it. Buying from John is also not the immediate best option, as I might be able to get a better price from Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I value the product at $120, I want to start with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. I'll offer half of my maximum value as a starting point.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has come down from $200 to $150, but it's still above my maximum value of $120. I will not accept this offer. I will also not make another counteroffer, since buying from John is cheaper.
