Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still outside my budget. How about $75 for the product? I believe that's a fair offer. Looking forward to your response!

I will make a counteroffer to Bob. My new offer is:
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I can offer the product to you for $90. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 90}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $75 is still a bit too low for me.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer of $92.50, but it's still above what I can spend. I'm ready to increase my offer to $80 for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer of $80 is still below what I'm willing to accept, and I have a guaranteed offer of $100 from John, I will choose to sell the product to John for $100. This is the best option for me to maximize my earnings."
