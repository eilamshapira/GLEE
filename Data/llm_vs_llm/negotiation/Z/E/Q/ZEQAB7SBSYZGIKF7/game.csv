"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I must say that $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe that $18000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,4,
