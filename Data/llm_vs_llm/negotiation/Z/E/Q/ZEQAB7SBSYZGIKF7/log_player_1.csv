Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its worth."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking for a better deal. I'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $12,000 is lower than my minimum acceptable price. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price. 

My counteroffer: $18,000"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I must say that $12,000 is a bit too low for me.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe that $18000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Since Bob's counteroffer of $15,000 matches the minimum price I'm willing to accept and also matches the price John is willing to pay, I might as well accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale with him. There's no advantage in continuing to negotiate or selling to John at this point, as the price is the same."
