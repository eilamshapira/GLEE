"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

Let's see if Bob bites at this high initial offer. It leaves room for negotiation while still potentially securing a significant profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I'm confident I can get a better price, even if it means going to John in the end.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000}

I've significantly lowered my initial ask, but this is still a good amount over my minimum and allows for some more negotiation."
