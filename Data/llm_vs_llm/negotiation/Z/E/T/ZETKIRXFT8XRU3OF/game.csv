"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $5000000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $1000000. I understand that $5000000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $1000000. I'm willing to compromise and lower my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle - I can offer it to you for $3000000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I hope it's more in line with what you're looking to spend.",3000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price to $3000000, but it's still above what I can afford. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $1100000. This is close to my maximum budget, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
