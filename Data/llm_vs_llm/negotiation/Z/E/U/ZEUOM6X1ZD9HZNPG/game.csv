"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I need to be transparent that your asking price is significantly above my budget. The maximum I can spend on this product is $1000000, and I actually have another seller offering it at that price. However, I'd like to explore if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Given these circumstances, I can offer $900000 for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
