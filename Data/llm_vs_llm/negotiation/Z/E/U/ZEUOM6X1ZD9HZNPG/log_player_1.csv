"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be beneficial for you. Given its high quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $1,800,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential value."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I need to be transparent that your asking price is significantly above my budget. The maximum I can spend on this product is $1000000, and I actually have another seller offering it at that price. However, I'd like to explore if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Given these circumstances, I can offer $900000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

The rationale is clear here. Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and his statement about having another seller at $1,000,000 suggests he won't go much higher. Since John is willing to pay $1,500,000, which matches my minimum acceptable price, it's best to take the guaranteed deal with John rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to reach my minimum threshold."
