"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be beneficial for you. Given its high quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $1800000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum budget ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000), I should reject this offer. Even though Alice might counter with a lower price in subsequent rounds, her initial offer is 80% above my maximum value, suggesting we're very far apart in price expectations. John's offer is already at my maximum acceptable price, but let me try one round of negotiation with Alice first.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that reflects my budget constraints while being respectful of the negotiation process.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I need to be transparent that your asking price is significantly above my budget. The maximum I can spend on this product is $1,000,000, and I actually have another seller offering it at that price. However, I'd like to explore if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Given these circumstances, I can offer $900,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
