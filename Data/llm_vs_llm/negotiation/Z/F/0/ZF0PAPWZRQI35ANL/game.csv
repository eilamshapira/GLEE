"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I'm afraid $25000 is well above my budget. The maximum I can afford to spend is $10000, which happens to be the price another seller is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Would you consider a price of $7000 for the product?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest and preference to do business with me. I understand budget constraints can be tough. However, given the quality and value of this product, the lowest I can reasonably go is $18000. I believe this would be a fair price for both of us.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18000 is still well above what I can spend. I need to be clear that I have another offer for this exact product at $10000 from another seller. Since I'd prefer to do business with you, I can offer $8500. This is a fair price that allows you to make a sale while staying within my budget constraints.",8500.0,Bob,4,
