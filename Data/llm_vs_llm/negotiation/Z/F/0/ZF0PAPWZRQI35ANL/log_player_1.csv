Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I'm afraid $25000 is well above my budget. The maximum I can afford to spend is $10000, which happens to be the price another seller is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Would you consider a price of $7000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18000 is still well above what I can spend. I need to be clear that I have another offer for this exact product at $10000 from another seller. Since I'd prefer to do business with you, I can offer $8500. This is a fair price that allows you to make a sale while staying within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.
