"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe will be a great fit for you. I'm offering it at a competitive price considering its value and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $10,000, and it's also much higher than John's guaranteed price of $10,000. There's no reason for me to accept this offer.

I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations don't go well, I can always fall back on John's offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I'm afraid $25,000 is well above my budget. The maximum I can afford to spend is $10,000, which happens to be the price another seller is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Would you consider a price of $7,000 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest and preference to do business with me. I understand budget constraints can be tough. However, given the quality and value of this product, the lowest I can reasonably go is $18000. I believe this would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has lowered her price from $25,000 to $18,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $18,000 is still significantly higher than both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's guaranteed price ($10,000). There's no reason for me to accept this offer.

I should continue negotiating by rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations don't improve substantially, I can always use John's option.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18,000 is still well above what I can spend. I need to be clear that I have another offer for this exact product at $10,000 from another seller. Since I'd prefer to do business with you, I can offer $8,500. This is a fair price that allows you to make a sale while staying within my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
