Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a fair price."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I was hoping to purchase the product for $80. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since the product is worth no less than $80 to me, and Bob's offer is exactly $80, I could consider accepting it. However, I also have the option to try to negotiate a higher price. Given that we are only in Round 2 and I have 8 more rounds to negotiate, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. It's a great product and I believe it's worth it. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle."", ""product_price"": 100}"
