"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $600000 is a bit too low for us. I understand that you see the product's worth at 800000$, and I can respect that so would you be willing to consider a slightly higher price of $900000? I think it's a fair middle ground for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for your new proposal. I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750000, which is closer to my initial valuation of the product. Would you be willing to consider this price?",750000.0,Bob,4,
