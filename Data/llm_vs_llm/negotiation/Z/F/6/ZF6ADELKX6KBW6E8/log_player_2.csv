Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $2,500,000 is more than twice the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,200,000), it's not a good deal for me. I'd like to try to negotiate a better price.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000, I'll offer half of that amount to see how Alice responds.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Since Alice was willing to lower her price by $300,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between my previous offer and her new offer.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","In Round 3, Alice's offer was $2,200,000, and my previous counteroffer was $600,000. To meet her halfway, I'll calculate the midpoint: ($2,200,000 + $600,000) / 2 = $1,400,000. However, since I'm trying to save as much money as possible, I'll offer a bit less than that.

I'll reject this offer again and try to negotiate further. Since Alice has been gradually lowering her price, I'll try to encourage her to continue doing so.

Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, which is my maximum budget, I don't see a reason to accept Alice's offer.

I'll reject this offer again, but I'm running out of rounds to negotiate. I might consider buying from John soon if Alice doesn't make a more significant concession.

The midpoint would be: ($1,800,000 + $1,200,000) / 2 = $1,500,000. However, I'll offer a bit less than that to try to get a better deal.

At this point, buying from John for $1,200,000 seems like the best option. I've tried to negotiate with Alice, but she's not willing to meet me at a price I'm comfortable with.
