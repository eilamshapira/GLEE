"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $6000 for the product. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your interest. However, $6000 is too low for the value I believe the product offers. How about we meet closer in the middle at $15000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down to $15000, Alice. I understand the product's value, but I'm still limited by my budget. How about we try $7000? That's a bit higher than my last offer but still within my financial limits.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're working within a tight budget, but this product is worth considerably more. How about $13500? This price is fair considering the high-quality and value it brings.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13500 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $7500? This is my final offer within my budget constraints.",7500.0,Bob,6,
