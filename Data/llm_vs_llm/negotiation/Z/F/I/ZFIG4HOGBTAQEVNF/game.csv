"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is way beyond my budget. Given the market conditions and my research, I can offer $8000 for the product. This is a fair starting point considering my budget constraints.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your budget, I can't go that low. This product is truly special. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $18000.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $18000 is still far beyond what I can pay. I know the product is worth $15000 to you. To be transparent, I have another seller offering the same product for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer $9000, which is a fair price considering the market alternatives.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear what you're saying, but I'm not comfortable going that low. While I appreciate your preference for doing business with me, I can't compete with that $10000 offer. However, given your interest, I'm willing to go down to $16500. That's my final offer.",16500.0,Alice,5,
