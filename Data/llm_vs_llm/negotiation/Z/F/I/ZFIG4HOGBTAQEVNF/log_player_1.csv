"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! Considering its value and features, I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is way beyond my budget. Given the market conditions and my research, I can offer $8000 for the product. This is a fair starting point considering my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Okay, Bob's offer of $8,000 is unacceptable. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your budget, I can't go that low. This product is truly special. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $18,000."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $18000 is still far beyond what I can pay. I know the product is worth $15000 to you. To be transparent, I have another seller offering the same product for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer $9000, which is a fair price considering the market alternatives. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $9,000 is still too low, especially considering my minimum price is $15,000. However, the mention of a competitor offering the product for $10,000 gives me pause. I need to be careful, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'll reject and counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I hear what you're saying, but I'm not comfortable going that low. While I appreciate your preference for doing business with me, I can't compete with that $10,000 offer. However, given your interest, I'm willing to go down to $16,500. That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 16500}"
