"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! Considering its value and features, I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum budget ($10,000) and John's alternative price ($10,000). It would be wise to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations don't progress favorably, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is way beyond my budget. Given the market conditions and my research, I can offer $8,000 for the product. This is a fair starting point considering my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your budget, I can't go that low. This product is truly special. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $18000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $18,000 is still significantly above both my maximum budget ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000). While she did reduce the price, it's not nearly enough to make it worthwhile. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, but if Alice doesn't come down significantly in price, I may need to consider John's offer soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $18,000 is still far beyond what I can pay. I know the product is worth $15,000 to you. To be transparent, I have another seller offering the same product for $10,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer $9,000, which is a fair price considering the market alternatives."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear what you're saying, but I'm not comfortable going that low. While I appreciate your preference for doing business with me, I can't compete with that $10000 offer. However, given your interest, I'm willing to go down to $16500. That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's final offer of $16,500 is still well above my maximum budget of $10,000, and she's indicated she can't match John's price of $10,000. Since Alice stated this is her ""final offer"" and it's still significantly higher than both my budget and the alternative option, it's best to end the negotiation and purchase from John at $10,000. Continuing the negotiation would likely not lead to a better outcome, and we'd just be wasting time."
