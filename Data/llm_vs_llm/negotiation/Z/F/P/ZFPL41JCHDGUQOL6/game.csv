"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $600000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value this product brings is truly significant, and $600000 undervalues it considerably.  How about we meet in the middle at $850000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle at $750000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value to both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  While $750000 is getting closer, I can't let this go for less than $825000.  This is my final offer.",825000.0,Alice,5,
