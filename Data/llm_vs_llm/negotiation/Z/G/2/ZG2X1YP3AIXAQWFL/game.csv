"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25000 is significantly above my budget. I've researched similar products in the market, and I can actually get this product elsewhere for $15000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider selling it for $12000? This would be a fair price that works within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, I cannot accept $12000 as it's below my cost basis. You mentioned you can find similar products for $15000. I'm willing to match that price plus a small premium for the superior quality and service I provide. I can offer you the product for $17500. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents excellent value given the product's quality.",17500.0,Alice,3,
