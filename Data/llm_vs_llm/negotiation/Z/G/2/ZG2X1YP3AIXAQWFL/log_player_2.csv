"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it for $25000. This price reflects the product's quality and market value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offered price of $25,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $15,000. Since John is offering the product for $15,000, which is my maximum acceptable price, there's no reason to accept Alice's much higher offer. However, I'll reject first to try negotiating with Alice for a better price before potentially buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25,000 is significantly above my budget. I've researched similar products in the market, and I can actually get this product elsewhere for $15,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider selling it for $12,000? This would be a fair price that works within my budget."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, I cannot accept $12000 as it's below my cost basis. You mentioned you can find similar products for $15000. I'm willing to match that price plus a small premium for the superior quality and service I provide. I can offer you the product for $17500. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents excellent value given the product's quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's new offer of $17,500 is still above my maximum value of $15,000, and John is offering the exact same product for $15,000, it makes the most economic sense to buy from John. Alice's argument about superior quality and service doesn't justify paying $2,500 more, especially when the product is worth no more than $15,000 to me."
