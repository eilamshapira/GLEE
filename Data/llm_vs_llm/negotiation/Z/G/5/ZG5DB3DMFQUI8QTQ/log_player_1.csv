Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for presenting your product and its potential value. While I agree it seems like a quality product,  $1800000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1000000 as a starting point for further negotiation.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $1,000,000, I'm afraid I can't accept it as it falls below my minimum threshold. I have other interested buyers willing to pay significantly more. However, I value the possibility of doing business with you. I could come down to $1,650,000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price reflects the true value of the product while still giving you room for a good return on your investment."", ""product_price"": 1650000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While your adjusted offer is closer to what I had in mind,  $1650000 is still a bit steep for me. To be frank, I have a hard limit of $1200000. If you're willing to come down to that, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.
