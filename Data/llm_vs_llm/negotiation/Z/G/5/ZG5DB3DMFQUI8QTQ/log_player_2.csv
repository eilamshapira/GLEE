Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $1000000, I'm afraid I can't accept it as it falls below my minimum threshold. I have other interested buyers willing to pay significantly more. However, I value the possibility of doing business with you. I could come down to $1650000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price reflects the true value of the product while still giving you room for a good return on your investment.

While your adjusted offer is closer to what I had in mind,  $1,650,000 is still a bit steep for me. To be frank, I have a hard limit of $1,200,000. If you're willing to come down to that, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
