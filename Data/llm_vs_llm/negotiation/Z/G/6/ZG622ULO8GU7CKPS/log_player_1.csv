"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that I have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay $15,000, and knowing that the product is only worth $8,000 to Bob, I'll start with a high offer to test Bob's willingness to negotiate while maintaining my strong position.

{""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $5,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) and even below his own valuation ($8,000). This low offer suggests he might not be negotiating in good faith. Given that I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, there's no reason to continue negotiations with such a low offer.
