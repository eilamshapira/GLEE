"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","The current offer is $17,000, which is much higher than my maximum willingness to pay of $8,000. Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is not a good option.

Buying from John for $8,000 is a safe choice, guaranteeing a purchase within my budget. However, there's a potential to save money if I can negotiate a lower price with Alice.

Since this is the first round, I'll reject Alice's offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price. If the negotiation fails after several rounds, I can always fall back on buying from John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, I'll send Alice a counteroffer that is significantly lower than her initial offer, but hopefully high enough to keep her engaged in the negotiation.
