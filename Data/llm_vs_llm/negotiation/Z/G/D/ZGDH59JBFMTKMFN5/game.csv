"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is a bit higher than I was expecting. How about I offer you $60 for the product?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is far too low for this product. I have significant costs involved and cannot go below $165. This is already a considerable reduction from my initial offer, considering the product's quality and value. Would you be willing to consider this price?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $165 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $70. How about we settle at this price?",70.0,Bob,4,
