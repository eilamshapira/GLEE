Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is a bit higher than I was expecting. How about I offer you $60 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since $60 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I want to try negotiating with Bob one more time before potentially selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is far too low for this product. I have significant costs involved and cannot go below $165. This is already a considerable reduction from my initial offer, considering the product's quality and value. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 165}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $165 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $70. How about we settle at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $150. Bob's offers are significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and it seems unlikely that we'll reach an agreement that works for both parties. John's offer of $150 meets my minimum requirements and is a guaranteed sale."
