"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $9500. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since the product is worth $10,000 to me and Alice's initial offer is $9,500, which is close to my maximum budget but still below it, I have room to negotiate for a better price. Given that the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's potential for us to meet at a price that's lower than $9,500 but still profitable for Alice. Therefore, I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer to try and save some money.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's initial offer of $9,500 and knowing the product's value to her is $8,000, I'll aim for a price that's significantly lower than her offer but still reasonable, hoping to find a mutually beneficial agreement. A good starting point for my counteroffer could be slightly above Alice's valuation of the product, to ensure she's still making a profit while I save money.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I believe the product is valuable, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,200 for it."", ""product_price"": 8200}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $9000. This is a significantly reduced price and reflects my desire to make a deal with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has reduced the price to $9,000, which is a move in the right direction but still higher than I'd like to pay, considering the product's value to her is $8,000. Since she's willing to negotiate and has come down by $500 from her initial offer, it indicates there's flexibility in her pricing. However, $9,000 is still close to my maximum budget of $10,000, and I'm aiming to save as much money as possible.

Given this, I'll reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer. This time, I'll try to meet her halfway between her current offer and my previous counteroffer, aiming for a price that's more favorable to me while still being realistic about Alice's willingness to sell.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I'll send a new counteroffer: 

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price. However, $9,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone. Considering your last reduction, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $8,600?"", ""product_price"": 8600}"
