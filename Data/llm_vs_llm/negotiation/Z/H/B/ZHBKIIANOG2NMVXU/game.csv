"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $14500 is a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $12000 is actually my absolute bottom line cost for this item. Based on the product's quality and market value, I can come down to $13800, which is still a fair price considering the $15000 value you'll be getting from it. This represents a meaningful discount from my initial offer while still ensuring you get excellent value.",13800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $13800 is still a bit out of my budget. Could you possibly go down to $12500? I really want to make this work, but I need to stay within my financial limits.",12500.0,Bob,4,
