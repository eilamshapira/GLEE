"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's initial offer is $120, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, and I also have the option to buy it from John for the same price, I don't see any benefit in accepting Alice's offer without trying to negotiate a better price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in hopes of getting a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, to see if we can negotiate a better price. Let's say I'll offer $90.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $105 is still below my maximum budget of $120, and it's a better deal than buying from John. However, I'd like to try to negotiate an even better price. Since Alice was willing to come down from $120 to $105, it's possible she may be willing to go lower.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer. Let's say I'll offer $95.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

(Note: After this, I'll send a counteroffer of $95)"
