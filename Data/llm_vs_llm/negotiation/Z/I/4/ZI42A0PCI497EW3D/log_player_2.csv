"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm sure you'll find our asking price of $1000000 quite reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'll analyze this situation:

1) Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000
2) The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
3) I can buy the same product from John for $800,000
4) If I reject Alice's offer, I can make a counteroffer

Since Alice's offer ($1,000,000) exceeds both the product's value to me and John's price ($800,000), it doesn't make sense to accept. I could make a counteroffer, but I already have a guaranteed option at $800,000 from John. Making a counteroffer would only be beneficial if I believed I could get the product for less than $800,000 from Alice.

Given that Alice started with such a high price ($1,000,000), it might be difficult to negotiate down below $800,000 quickly. The safe and economical choice would be to buy from John.
