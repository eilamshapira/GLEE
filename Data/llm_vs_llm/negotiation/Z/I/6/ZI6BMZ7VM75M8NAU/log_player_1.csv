"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. Considering its quality and rarity, I'm setting the initial price at $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $20000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Given my budget, I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Okay, given Bob's counteroffer of $12,000, I have to weigh my options carefully. I know John will give me $12,000. This is a critical decision because I don't know how much the product is worth to Bob.

Since my minimum acceptable price is $12,000, and Bob offered me exactly that, I should consider the risk of losing a potential sale if I don't close now.

Therefore:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
