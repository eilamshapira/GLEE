"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit.

{""product_price"": 1,100,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Given that Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly higher than John's $800,000 and represents a good profit from my minimum value of $800,000, I'll accept this offer. While I might try to negotiate for a slightly higher price, there's a risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away, and $1,000,000 is a very reasonable price.
