"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $10,000
2. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
3. John's fixed price is $12,000
4. I can try to negotiate with Alice for an even better price

Alice's offer of $10,000 is already $2,000 less than John's price and well within my maximum value of $12,000. While I could try to negotiate for an even lower price, there's a risk that Alice might increase her price in subsequent rounds if I make a counteroffer. Since this is already a good deal that saves me $2,000 compared to John's price, I should take it.
