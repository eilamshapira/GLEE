"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $250. Let me know if you'd like to take it at this price!",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $75 for the product. Let me know if that works for you!",75.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. However, $75 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $200 for the product. Let me know if this works for you!",200.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $250 was a bit high for you. How about we settle at $180? This is a good compromise and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll get from the product. Let me know what you think!",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $180 is still too high for me. How about we meet at $85? I think this is a fair price considering my budget constraints. Let me know if you can accept this offer!",85.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I see where you're coming from with your budget, but $85 is still below my minimum. I can go as low as $160 for the product. This is my final offer before I consider other options. Let me know if you can work with this price!",160.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower the price further to $155. This is really the best I can do while still valuing the product appropriately. Let me know if this works for you!",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $155, but it's still beyond what I'm willing to spend. Could we possibly settle at $90? I really want to make this work, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think!",90.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your situation, but $90 is still too low for me to accept. I'm willing to go down to $152 as my absolute final offer. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider selling to someone else. Let me know if you can meet at this price!",152.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I really want to make this work for both of us. I can lower the price to $151, which is the lowest I can go while still valuing the product appropriately. This is my final offer. Let me know if you can accept this!",151.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to lower the price, but $151 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95 as my final offer. If this doesn't work for you, I might have to consider other options. Let me know if you can accept this!",95.0,Bob,8,
"Hi Bob, I'm sorry, but $95 is still below my minimum. I have another buyer willing to purchase the product at a price that meets my needs. Thank you for your interest, and I hope we can do business in the future. I will be selling the product to John for $150.",,Alice,8,SellToJhon
