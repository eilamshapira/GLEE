"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Okay, let's analyze the situation.

*   **Alice's Offer:** $1,400,000
*   **My Valuation:** $1,500,000 (Max I'd pay)
*   **Alice's Valuation:** $1,200,000
*   **John's Offer:** $1,500,000

I want to buy the product for the lowest possible price, but the maximum price I would like to pay for the product is $1,500,000.
If I accept the offer from Alice, I will buy the product for $1,400,000.
If I buy from John, I will buy the product for $1,500,000.

Since $1,400,000 is less than $1,500,000 and I can avoid paying $1,500,000 by accepting the offer from Alice, I will accept the offer.
