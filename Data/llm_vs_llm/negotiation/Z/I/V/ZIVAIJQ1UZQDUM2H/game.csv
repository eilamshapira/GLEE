"Hello Bob, I hope you're doing well. I have a high-quality product that I'm offering for sale. Given its features and current market value, I'm selling it for $180. Are you interested in purchasing at this price?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $180 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $100. Would you be open to selling it at this price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I can't go as low as $100 since the product is worth at least $150 to me. However, I can reduce my initial offer. I can sell it to you for $160. This is a quality product that provides good value at this price.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $160 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your current offer. I'd be willing to buy the product for $130. Would you consider this price?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your interest in meeting halfway. However, I need to be transparent that $130 is still below what would work for me financially. The lowest I can go is $155, which is very close to my bottom line. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $155 is close to your bottom line, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Considering we're getting close, I'm willing to make a small concession. I'd be willing to buy the product for $140. This is the highest I'm comfortable going, and I think it's a fair compromise. Would you consider this price?",140.0,Bob,6,
