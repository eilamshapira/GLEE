"Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: Pay $85
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John: Pay $80

Since:
- The product is worth $80 to me
- Alice is offering it for $85 (which is more than my maximum value)
- John is offering it for $80 (which equals my maximum value)

The rational decision would be to buy from John, as it saves me $5 compared to Alice's offer and matches my maximum valuation of the product.
