Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but I think $11500 is a bit steep. The product is certainly valuable, but I can't justify that price point. I can offer you $10500 for it, which gives you a good profit while still being reasonable for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
