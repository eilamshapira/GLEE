"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to offer you my product for $11500. I believe this is a great opportunity for you, considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to consider Alice's offer of $11,500 compared to my alternatives. Since the product is worth up to $12,000 to me, and John is offering it for $12,000, Alice's offer of $11,500 saves me $500. However, I might be able to negotiate an even better price with Alice, given that the product is worth only $10,000 to her.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but I think $11,500 is a bit steep. The product is certainly valuable, but I can't justify that price point. I can offer you $10,500 for it, which gives you a good profit while still being reasonable for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. How about we settle at $11000? This way, we both benefit from the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has come down to $11,000 from her initial offer of $11,500, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This offer saves me $1,000 compared to John's price of $12,000, which is significant. I could try to negotiate further, but there's a risk of prolonging the negotiation without much additional benefit.

Since the offer is $1,000 below my maximum price point and gives me good savings, I'll accept this offer.
