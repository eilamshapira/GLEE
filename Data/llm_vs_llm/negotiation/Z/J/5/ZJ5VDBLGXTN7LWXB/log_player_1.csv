Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
