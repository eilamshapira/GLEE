"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has value, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $900000.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $900000, it's significantly below the value this product will bring to your business. I understand you're looking for a better price, so I'm willing to come down to $1150000. This is still a considerable discount from the $1500000 value you'll receive, giving you a $350000 return on your investment. I believe this is a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1150000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $1025000?  I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value it brings while working within my limits.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
