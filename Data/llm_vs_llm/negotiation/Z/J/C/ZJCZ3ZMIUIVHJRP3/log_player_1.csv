Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm delighted to offer you the opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its exceptional quality and potential, I'm asking $2,000,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would have to be incredibly special for me to even consider going that high. I'd be willing to offer $100000 to start. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Okay, Bob's initial counteroffer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for $100,000. My cost is $1,200,000 and I want to maximize my profit. I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100,000 is significantly below the product's true value and my minimum. Considering its rarity and potential, I'm willing to come down from my initial offer. I'll offer it to you for $1,900,000."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but we're still very far apart on price.  To be honest, I'm not sure this product is going to work for me at the price range you're talking about.  I could go up to $200000, but that's absolutely my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer is still far below my minimum. I could keep negotiating, but he's clearly low-balling. I could try another counter offer, but the difference between his offer ($200,000) and my minimum ($1,200,000) is $1,000,000. It's unlikely I'll get to a good price with him. I'll cut my losses and go with the sure thing.
