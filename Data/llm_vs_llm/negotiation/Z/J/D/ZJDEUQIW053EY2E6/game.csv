"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $150 is too high for me. I can actually get this product from another seller for $100. But I'd like to work with you - would you consider selling it for $80? This would save me some time and effort in going elsewhere.",80.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is below my minimum price. I can go as low as $120, which is a fair discount from my original offer. Let me know if this works for you.",120.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your situation. I can lower the price to $110, which is the best I can do while still valuing our potential business relationship. Let me know if this works for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
