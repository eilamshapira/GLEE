Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $150 is too high for me. I can actually get this product from another seller for $100. But I'd like to work with you - would you consider selling it for $80? This would save me some time and effort in going elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is below my minimum price. I can go as low as $120, which is a fair discount from my original offer. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 120}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your situation. I can lower the price to $110, which is the best I can do while still valuing our potential business relationship. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 110}"
