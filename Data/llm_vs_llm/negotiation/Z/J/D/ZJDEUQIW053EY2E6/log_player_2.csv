"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $150. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $150 is higher than both my maximum valuation ($100) and John's price ($100). It would be irrational to accept this offer when I can either make a counteroffer or buy from John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $150 is too high for me. I can actually get this product from another seller for $100. But I'd like to work with you - would you consider selling it for $80? This would save me some time and effort in going elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your situation. I can lower the price to $110, which is the best I can do while still valuing our potential business relationship. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer ($110) is still higher than John's price ($100), and Alice seems unwilling to go below $110 based on her ""best I can do"" statement, it makes the most economic sense to buy from John at $100. This saves me $10 compared to Alice's offer, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice would result in a better price."
