"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, I've been researching similar items in the market, and based on current trends and comparable products, I believe a more reasonable price would be $11500. This would be a fair deal for both of us while still giving you a good profit margin. I'm ready to make the purchase immediately at this price. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your prompt response and for sharing your research. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I must consider the product's value to me and the demand I've seen from other potential buyers. With that in mind, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I can offer the product to you for $12750. This price still gives you a great deal while allowing me to meet my minimum requirements. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. That shows good faith in our negotiation. I've been comparing with several other options in the market, and while your offer is moving in the right direction, I'm prepared to pay $11800 for the product. This is a fair increase from my previous offer and provides you with a good profit margin. I'm ready to complete this purchase immediately at this price and save us both the time of extended negotiations. Would you be willing to accept this offer?",11800.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your continued interest in the product and for acknowledging my efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, I still believe the product's value warrants a higher price. Considering your new offer, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer the product to you for $12300. This price is closer to your target while still allowing me to meet my minimum requirements. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12300.0,Alice,5,
