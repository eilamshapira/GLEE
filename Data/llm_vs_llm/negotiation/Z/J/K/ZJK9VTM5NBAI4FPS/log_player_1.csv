Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, I've been researching similar items in the market, and based on current trends and comparable products, I believe a more reasonable price would be $11500. This would be a fair deal for both of us while still giving you a good profit margin. I'm ready to make the purchase immediately at this price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
