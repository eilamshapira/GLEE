"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12000 is quite high for my budget. I can find similar products in the market for much less. I would be willing to pay $6500 for the product. This is a fair price that would work for both of us.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but this product is truly worth more than that. I can lower the price to $10000, which is competitive for this quality. Let me know your thoughts.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $10000 is still above my budget. I can go up to $7500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is really the most I can do considering market prices and my budget constraints.",7500.0,Bob,4,
