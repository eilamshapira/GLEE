Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12000 is quite high for my budget. I can find similar products in the market for much less. I would be willing to pay $6500 for the product. This is a fair price that would work for both of us.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $10000 is still above my budget. I can go up to $7500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is really the most I can do considering market prices and my budget constraints.
