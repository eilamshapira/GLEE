"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it for $12000. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's guaranteed price of $8,000, it makes sense to reject this offer. I can either try to negotiate with Alice for a better price or ultimately buy from John if we can't reach a favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12,000 is quite high for my budget. I can find similar products in the market for much less. I would be willing to pay $6,500 for the product. This is a fair price that would work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 6500}

Rationale: I'm starting with a counteroffer of $6,500 because:
1. It's below my maximum value of $8,000
2. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, giving room for negotiation
3. If Alice accepts, I'll save $1,500 compared to John's price
4. If Alice counters, we still have room to negotiate up to my maximum of $8,000
5. Worst case, I can always buy from John at $8,000 if negotiations fail"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but this product is truly worth more than that. I can lower the price to $10000, which is competitive for this quality. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: Alice has reduced her price from $12,000 to $10,000, showing some flexibility, but this is still above both:
1. My maximum value for the product ($8,000)
2. John's guaranteed price ($8,000)

There's no reason to accept a price that's higher than both my maximum value and my alternative option. I should either try one more counteroffer or go with John's option. Since Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing her price, it's worth trying one more counteroffer before potentially going with John's option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $10,000 is still above my budget. I can go up to $7,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is really the most I can do considering market prices and my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 7500}

Rationale: I'm offering $7,500 because:
1. It's below my maximum value of $8,000
2. It's a significant increase from my previous offer of $6,500, showing I'm willing to negotiate in good faith
3. It's still $500 less than John's price, giving me potential savings
4. The $2,500 increase from my last offer shows substantial movement, which might encourage Alice to meet me at a reasonable price
5. If Alice refuses, I can still fall back on John's $8,000 offer without any loss"
