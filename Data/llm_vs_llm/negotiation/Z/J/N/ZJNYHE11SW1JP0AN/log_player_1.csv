Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my offer price to maximize my earnings. 

If I offer Bob a price that's too high, he might reject it, and I'll end up selling to John for $100.
If I offer Bob a price that's too low, I'll miss out on potential profit.

Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, theoretically he should accept any price below that. However, I want to leave him with some incentive to accept while maximizing my return.

I'll offer a price that gives Bob a small discount compared to the product's value to him, but still significantly higher than my fallback option of $100.
