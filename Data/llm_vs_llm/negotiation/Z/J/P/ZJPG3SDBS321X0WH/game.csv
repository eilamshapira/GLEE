"Alice, while I appreciate the offer,  $1100000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and  allowing for a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your candid response. However, I'm afraid $850000 is a bit low for us. Given the product's exceptional quality, I believe $1000000 is a more reasonable price. This ensures that both parties walk away satisfied. Let's continue to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your perspective, but $1000000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $900000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a fair compromise. I believe this price allows for a reasonable profit for you while remaining within my financial constraints.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
