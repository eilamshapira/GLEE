Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","$9,000 is too close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and since Bob's maximum value is $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob has only increased his offer by $500, which suggests he's moving very slowly in negotiations. However, we still have 6 rounds left, and there's a significant gap between his $9,500 and the product's value to him ($15,000). I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob is slowly increasing his offers ($9,000 → $9,500 → $10,000), showing he's willing to negotiate upward. While $10,000 is better than my minimum of $8,000, we still have 4 rounds left and significant room between his current offer and his maximum value. I'll reject and continue negotiating.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's small increment ($250) suggests he's becoming very resistant to larger increases, but we only have 2 rounds left after this. Given the risk of running out of time and the fact that $10,250 is significantly better than my fallback option with John ($8,000), I'll accept this offer.
