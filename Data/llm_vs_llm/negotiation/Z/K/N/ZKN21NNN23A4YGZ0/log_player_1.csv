"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my first offer to Bob. I want to start high to see how interested he is.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I've been thinking about its value and the quality is exceptional. I'm offering it to you for $25,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! The product sounds great, but that's a bit outside my budget right now. I'm looking to spend no more than $12000. Would you consider an offer of $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a tough one. Bob's offer is at my absolute minimum. However, I still have a few rounds left, and the product might be worth more to him. Let's try to push a little higher.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, let's see if I can get a bit more.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate that you're interested! I'm willing to come down, but $10,000 is just not feasible for me. Considering the quality and the time I've invested, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $17,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down Alice! I appreciate that. However, I'm still trying to stick within my budget of $12000. Would you be willing to go down to $11000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Hmm, Bob is still very far from my counter offer of $17,000. Accepting $11,000 would barely cover my expenses, and I can always sell it to John for $10,000. I should probably counteroffer one more time.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, let's see if I can find a good middle ground.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your patience. Considering the product's value and your interest, I can come down further. How about $15,000? This is a significant drop and reflects the quality and unique aspects of the product."", ""product_price"": 15000}"

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","$12,000 is starting to look attractive, but I still feel like the product is worth more. Since I have 4 more rounds, and I think I can get a little bit more.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, let's try to get a bit closer to my desired value. I am going to reduce my asking price, but not by a lot.
