"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that I have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay $1,500,000, and knowing that the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, I'll start with a high initial offer to test Bob's willingness to negotiate.

{""product_price"": 1,400,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and even below his own valuation of the product ($800,000). Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, and Bob's opening offer suggests he's not willing to approach my minimum price, it would be most profitable to end the negotiation now.
