"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I was hoping to spend less. How about we settle for $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and also lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($15,000), and considering I have the option to sell it to John for $15,000, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I am willing to negotiate further to see if we can meet at a mutually beneficial price. Thus, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend less, but I must say $8,000 is quite lower than what I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value and my initial offer, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. Let's meet in the middle of my initial offer and your counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your adjustment, Alice. However, $14000 is still a bit high for me. Let's raise my previous offer to $10000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's new offer of $10,000 is still lower than my last counteroffer of $14,000, but it's getting closer to the minimum value I have for the product ($15,000). Since Bob is gradually increasing his offer, it indicates he's interested in the product and willing to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still below my comfort zone, especially when I have the option to sell it to John for $15,000.

Given that I have 6 more rounds to negotiate and Bob's offers are increasing, I'll reject his current offer and try to meet him somewhere in between, hoping to get closer to or exceed the $15,000 threshold.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for raising your offer to $10,000, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still need to consider the product's value and my initial investment. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to slightly reduce my previous counteroffer of $14,000. How about we settle for $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
