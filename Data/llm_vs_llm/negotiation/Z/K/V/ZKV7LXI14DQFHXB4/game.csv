,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is significantly below the product's value and my own valuation. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle? I'll offer it to you for $4000000.",4000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from the initial offer. However, $4000000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer, but I need to stay within a reasonable range. I'd like to propose a price of $1050000.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $3000000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. Considering my previous offer and your new price, I'd like to propose a compromise at $1150000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to finalize the deal if we can meet at this point.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
