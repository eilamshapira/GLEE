"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product's uniqueness, but I'm looking for something within a different price range. I'm willing to pay $1200000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm confident that its unique features and potential will ultimately justify a higher price. Could you consider $2000000? This represents a significant compromise on my end and demonstrates my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my position. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a lower price. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our discussions. I'm willing to come down to $1800000. This is my final offer, and I think it reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
