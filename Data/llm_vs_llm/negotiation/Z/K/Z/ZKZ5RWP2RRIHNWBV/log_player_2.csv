"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's something that's really valuable to me, and I'm offering it to you for $200. If you're not interested, no worries, I have another buyer lined up. But if you're looking for something unique and high-quality, this could be a great opportunity. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering the product for $200
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $100
4. If I reject Alice's offer, I can still buy from John

Since:
- Alice's price ($200) is significantly higher than my maximum value ($100)
- I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $100
- Buying from Alice would mean paying $100 more than the product's worth to me

The logical choice is to buy from John for $100.
