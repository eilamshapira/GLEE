"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $200 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $120, and also higher than John's price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 80}

I'll make a counteroffer of $80, which is significantly below John's price of $120. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially allowing me to get a better deal than John's offer. If Alice's value is low enough, she might accept this offer or at least counter with a more reasonable price than her initial $200."
