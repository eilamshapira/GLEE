"Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product to offer you today. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $50 for the product. Would you be willing to sell it to me at this price?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $50 is too low for this product's value. I can offer it to you for $150, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. This is a high-quality product that's worth every penny.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price, but $150 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product, considering its quality and value. Can we meet at this price?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I see we're making progress in our negotiation, but $75 is still below what I can accept for this product. I can come down to $130, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value. This is a significant reduction from my previous offers.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $130 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering our negotiation. Can we agree on this price?",90.0,Bob,6,
