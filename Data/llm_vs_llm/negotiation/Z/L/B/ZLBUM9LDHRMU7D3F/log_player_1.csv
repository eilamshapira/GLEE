"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product to offer you today. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $50 for the product. Would you be willing to sell it to me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round that's more reasonable while still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $50 is too low for this product's value. I can offer it to you for $150, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. This is a high-quality product that's worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price, but $150 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product, considering its quality and value. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and he has increased his offer from $50 to $75, there might be room for further negotiation. I'll make another counteroffer, but if we can't reach a price above $100, I always have the option to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I see we're making progress in our negotiation, but $75 is still below what I can accept for this product. I can come down to $130, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value. This is a significant reduction from my previous offers."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $130 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering our negotiation. Can we agree on this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since we've gone through several rounds of negotiation and Bob's highest offer ($90) is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and John is offering a guaranteed $100, it makes the most sense to sell to John at this point. The negotiation with Bob doesn't seem likely to reach a price above $100 in the remaining rounds."
