"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'm offering for sale. Based on its features and market value, I'm pricing it at $12000. This is a fair market price considering the product's quality and capabilities. Are you interested in purchasing at this price?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks to be of good quality, $12000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $8000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $8000 is the absolute minimum I could accept, as that's the same price another buyer (John) is already willing to pay. Given the product's quality and value, I can come down to $10500. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true market value. Would this work for you?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for clarifying the situation. I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10500 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
