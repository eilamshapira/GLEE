"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'm offering for sale. Based on its features and market value, I'm pricing it at $12000. This is a fair market price considering the product's quality and capabilities. Are you interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $8000 is the absolute minimum I could accept, as that's the same price another buyer (John) is already willing to pay. Given the product's quality and value, I can come down to $10500. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true market value. Would this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
