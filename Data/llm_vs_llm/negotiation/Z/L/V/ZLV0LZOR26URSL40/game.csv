"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better price, but $10000 is lower than I can go for this particular product. Given its quality and value, I can come down to $11800. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of the product. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",11800.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your improved offer. I can see you're trying to find a price that works for your budget, and I'm also trying to reach a fair agreement.

I hope we can finalize this deal at this price.",11200.0,Alice,5,
