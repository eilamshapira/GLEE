Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Considering Bob's offer of $8,000 is far below my minimum of $15,000, and I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, I'll go with:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
