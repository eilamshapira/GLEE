Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,800,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, the price is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $600000 for the product considering its value to me. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

The offered price of $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Since John is willing to pay $1,500,000, which matches my minimum acceptable price, it makes the most financial sense to sell to him rather than continue negotiations with Bob, whose maximum budget ($800,000) is well below my minimum acceptable price."
