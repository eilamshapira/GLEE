"Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2000000. This price reflects the product's true worth and potential value.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2000000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I believe a more reasonable price would be $800000, considering the market and my needs.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. However, $800000 is significantly below the product's value. I have another buyer willing to pay $1200000, which is my absolute minimum price. Given our previous interaction, I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price to $1600000, which I believe is still a fair price considering the product's value.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $1600000 is still above my budget. You mentioned another buyer willing to pay $1200000, which I believe is closer to the product's true value. Considering this, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and the other buyer's offer. I propose a price of $1000000.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and negotiation. However, as you acknowledged, I have a firm offer of $1200000 from another buyer. To make it worth my while to sell to you instead, I would need a price of $1300000. This is significantly lower than my initial asking price and represents a fair premium over my alternative option. If we can't reach an agreement above $1200000, I will need to proceed with the other buyer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
