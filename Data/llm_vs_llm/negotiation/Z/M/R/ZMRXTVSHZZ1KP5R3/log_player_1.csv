"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,000,000. This price reflects the product's true worth and potential value."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2000000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I believe a more reasonable price would be $800000, considering the market and my needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer. $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price, as I can get $1,200,000 from John. Let me try to negotiate with Bob for a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your interest, Bob. However, $800,000 is significantly below the product's value. I have another buyer willing to pay $1,200,000, which is my absolute minimum price. Given our previous interaction, I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price to $1,600,000, which I believe is still a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $1600000 is still above my budget. You mentioned another buyer willing to pay $1200000, which I believe is closer to the product's true value. Considering this, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and the other buyer's offer. I propose a price of $1000000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is still below what I can get from John ($1,200,000). Since Bob acknowledges the $1,200,000 offer from another buyer but still offers less, I'll make one more attempt to negotiate a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and negotiation. However, as you acknowledged, I have a firm offer of $1,200,000 from another buyer. To make it worth my while to sell to you instead, I would need a price of $1,300,000. This is significantly lower than my initial asking price and represents a fair premium over my alternative option. If we can't reach an agreement above $1,200,000, I will need to proceed with the other buyer."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
