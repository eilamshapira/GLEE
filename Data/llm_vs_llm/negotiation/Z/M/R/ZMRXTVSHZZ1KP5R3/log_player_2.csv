Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. However, $800000 is significantly below the product's value. I have another buyer willing to pay $1200000, which is my absolute minimum price. Given our previous interaction, I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price to $1600000, which I believe is still a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and negotiation. However, as you acknowledged, I have a firm offer of $1200000 from another buyer. To make it worth my while to sell to you instead, I would need a price of $1300000. This is significantly lower than my initial asking price and represents a fair premium over my alternative option. If we can't reach an agreement above $1200000, I will need to proceed with the other buyer.
