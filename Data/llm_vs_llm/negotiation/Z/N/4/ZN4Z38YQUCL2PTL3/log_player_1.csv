"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $1,050,000 because it's too low. The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, so there's room for a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to the middle ground between my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's maximum value ($1,200,000)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $1,075,000. While it's better than his previous offer, we still have several rounds left for negotiation, and the price is still significantly below what the product is worth to Bob ($1,200,000). I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, slightly lowering my previous ask but still aiming for a better price than $1,075,000."
