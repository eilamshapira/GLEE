"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but your price of $1200000 is more than I can justify. The maximum this product is worth to me is $1000000, which happens to be the same price another seller (John) is offering. I'd prefer to do business with you, so I'm willing to offer $800000. This gives you a quick sale while allowing me some savings compared to my alternative option.",800000.0,Bob,2,
