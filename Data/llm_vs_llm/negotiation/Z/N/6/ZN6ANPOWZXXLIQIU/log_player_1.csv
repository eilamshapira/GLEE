Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but your price of $1200000 is more than I can justify. The maximum this product is worth to me is $1000000, which happens to be the same price another seller (John) is offering. I'd prefer to do business with you, so I'm willing to offer $800000. This gives you a quick sale while allowing me some savings compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
