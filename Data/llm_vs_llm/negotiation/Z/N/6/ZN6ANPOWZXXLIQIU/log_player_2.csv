"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to present you with a unique opportunity to purchase an extraordinary product. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the offer from Alice ($1,200,000) exceeds the maximum amount that the product is worth to me ($1,000,000) and is also higher than John's alternative offer ($1,000,000), I should reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but your price of $1,200,000 is more than I can justify. The maximum this product is worth to me is $1,000,000, which happens to be the same price another seller (John) is offering. I'd prefer to do business with you, so I'm willing to offer $800,000. This gives you a quick sale while allowing me some savings compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer of $800000. However, I believe the value of this product is higher. I would be willing to let it go for $1000000. Letâ€™s work together to make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has now offered the product for $1,000,000, which matches both the maximum value of the product to me and John's alternative price. Since there's no advantage to buying from John instead (the price is identical), and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal, I should accept Alice's offer.
