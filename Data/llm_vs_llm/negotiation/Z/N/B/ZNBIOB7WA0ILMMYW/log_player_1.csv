Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Considering the situation:

*   The product is worth at least $8,000 to me.
*   Bob offered $10,000, which is a profit.
*   I can sell to John for $8,000.

I should **Accept Bob's offer** because it gives me a profit.
