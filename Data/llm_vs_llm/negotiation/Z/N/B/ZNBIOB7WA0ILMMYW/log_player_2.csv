"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This is a good starting point for negotiation. There's a significant gap between Alice's offer ($14,000) and what you're willing to pay (maximum $15,000) and Alice's perceived value ($8,000).  I'll aim to negotiate a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 
Let's see if Alice is willing to accept this offer. It's a significant reduction from her initial asking price but still leaves room for her to make a profit."
