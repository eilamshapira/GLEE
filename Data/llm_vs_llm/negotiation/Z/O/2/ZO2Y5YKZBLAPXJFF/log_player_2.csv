"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,500,000 exceeds the product's worth to me ($1,000,000) and is higher than John's price ($1,000,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept Alice's current offer. I can either try to negotiate with Alice or go with John's guaranteed offer.

Given that John is offering exactly the maximum value I'm willing to pay ($1,000,000), and Alice's initial offer is significantly higher, I'll choose to buy from John.
