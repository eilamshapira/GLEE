"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer of $20,000 is above my budget of $15,000, I will reject her offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a low offer and see how Alice responds.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $18,000 is still above my target price, but it's closer than her initial offer. Since I have 8 rounds left, I'll continue to negotiate and try to get a better price.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer. However, I'll keep in mind that I can always buy from John for $15,000, so I won't go much higher than that.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $18,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between her offer and my previous counteroffer of $10,000. However, I'll also keep in mind that I can buy the product from John for $15,000, so I won't go above that.

My new counteroffer will be $12,500, which is still below my maximum budget and gives Alice some room to negotiate.

{""product_price"": 12500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $16,000 is getting closer to my target price, but it's still above my maximum budget of $15,000. Since I can buy the product from John for $15,000, I don't see a reason to pay more to Alice.

I'll reject Alice's offer again, but I'll also consider the fact that I'm running out of rounds and I might not get a better deal. My next counteroffer will be closer to my maximum budget.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $16,000, and I can buy the product from John for $15,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's very close to my maximum budget. I'll offer $14,500, which is still below my maximum budget and gives Alice a chance to sell the product to me instead of me buying it from John.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $15,000 is exactly my maximum budget, and it's the same price that John is offering. At this point, I don't see any advantage in continuing to negotiate with Alice, as I can get the same price from John.

Since I'm not getting a better deal from Alice, and I've already reached my maximum budget, I'll choose to buy the product from John for $15,000. This way, I can ensure that I get the product at the price I'm willing to pay, without taking any further risks in the negotiation.
