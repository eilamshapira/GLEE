Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider the price I offer to Bob. If Bob rejects my offer, I'm guaranteed $10,000 from John. However, since I don't know how much the product is worth to Bob, I should offer a price that balances the risk of rejection with the potential for a higher profit.

I'll offer a price that is meaningfully higher than my guaranteed $10,000 alternative, but not so high that it would likely lead to immediate rejection.
