Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that:
1. The product is worth $1,200,000 to me (my minimum price)
2. The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob
3. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $1,200,000

I'll start with a high offer to test Bob's willingness to negotiate, but not so high that he'll immediately dismiss it.
