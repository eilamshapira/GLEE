# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $18000. I'm open to discussing further, so feel free to share your thoughts.

# Bob's message:
Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18,000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm looking to spend no more than $8,000. Would you be open to negotiating further?

The product price will be $8,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $8000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $13000? This feels like a fair compromise.

# Bob's message:
Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still quite high for me. I'm thinking of a price around $9,000. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.

The product price will be $9,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While I'm motivated to sell, I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. How about we split the difference again and settle on $11000?  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.
