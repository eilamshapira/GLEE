"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. If you're interested, please consider my offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Based on the information provided:

1. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to you
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $20,000
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $15,000

Alice's offer is $5,000 more than both the product's worth to you and John's price. It makes more financial sense to buy from John at $15,000.
