Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make a strategic decision here. 

If I offer the product to Bob at exactly $120, he should be indifferent between accepting and rejecting since the product's value to him is $120. However, there's a risk he might reject an offer that doesn't provide him any surplus.

If Bob rejects my offer, I'll still get $120 from John. This means I have no incentive to offer Bob a price lower than $120.

Given this analysis, I'll offer Bob the product at exactly $120, which is the maximum price he would theoretically accept.
