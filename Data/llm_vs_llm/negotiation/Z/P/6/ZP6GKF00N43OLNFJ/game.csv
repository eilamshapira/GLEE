"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $145 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $110 is below my minimum acceptable price. This product has substantial value, and I already have another buyer willing to pay $120. I can offer it to you for $140, which is still a good deal considering its quality and market value.",140.0,Alice,3,
