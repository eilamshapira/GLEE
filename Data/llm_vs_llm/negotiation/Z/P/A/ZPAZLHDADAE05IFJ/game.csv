"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your reply, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I cannot accept $600000. How about we meet in the middle at $900000? Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $750000. I believe this is a fair offer, considering my initial proposal and your counteroffer.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you, Bob, for your offer. I see that $750000 is a step in the right direction. How about we settle on $850000? I believe this will be mutually beneficial. Looking forward to your thoughts!",850000.0,Alice,5,
