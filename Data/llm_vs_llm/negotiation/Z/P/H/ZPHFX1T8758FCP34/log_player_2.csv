Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $60 is below what I can accept as the product is worth significantly more. I can come down to $90 which is already a good discount from my initial price. The quality and value of this product justifies this price. Would you be able to meet me at $90?

Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $90 is still higher than I'm willing to pay. I can increase my offer to $65. How about we meet in the middle and close the deal at this price?"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but $65 is still too low for me. The product has a minimum value of $80 to me, and I can't go below that. I'm willing to sell it to you at $85, which is a fair compromise from my previous offer. This is a quality product that's worth the investment. Can you meet me at $85?

# Your message to Alice:
Hi Alice, thank you for trying to find a middle ground. However, I've decided to purchase the product from another seller who offered it for $80. I appreciate your time and effort in negotiating with me."
