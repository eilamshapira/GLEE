"Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given that the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $100, Alice's offer of $130 is not favorable.

Alice's offer of $130 exceeds both my valuation ($100) and John's price ($100), so it doesn't make sense to accept it.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice that might be attractive to her while still being reasonable for me.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is better than her initial offer of $130, but it's still more than John's price of $100. Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and I can buy it from John for exactly $100, it doesn't make sense to pay $110 to Alice.
