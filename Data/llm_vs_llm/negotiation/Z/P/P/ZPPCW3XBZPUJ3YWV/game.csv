"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really enjoy! I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $50 is way too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $175 for it.  Let me know if you're still interested at that price.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for considering my previous offer. I understand that $50 was a bit low, but $175 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about $112.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $112.50 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",160.0,Alice,5,
