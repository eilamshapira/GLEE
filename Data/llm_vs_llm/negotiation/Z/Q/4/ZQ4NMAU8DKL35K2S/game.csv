"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $5000 for it. What do you think?",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I'm still pretty far off from that price point though.  Would you consider $7000? That's a pretty substantial offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your offer of $7000. However, I can go a bit lower than my previous offer. How about $10000? I think this is a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts!",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for getting back to me.  While $10000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $8000? That's my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and I understand your budget constraints. However, I can't go as low as $8000. How about we settle at $9500? I believe thatâ€™s a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,7,
