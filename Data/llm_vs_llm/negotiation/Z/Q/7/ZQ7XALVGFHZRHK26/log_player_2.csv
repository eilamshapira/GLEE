You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering.  It makes the most sense to buy from John at a lower price."
