(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $10,000 since it's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 (and even below John's guaranteed offer). I'll continue negotiating with Bob since we still have several rounds left.
