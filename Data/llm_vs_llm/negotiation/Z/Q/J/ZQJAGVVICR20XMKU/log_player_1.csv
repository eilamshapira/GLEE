Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. The product sounds interesting, but the price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $400000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I will reject Bob's offer of $400,000 because it's significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product, which is $1,200,000. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price. I'll proceed to the next round to send a counteroffer to Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that the initial price might be a bit high, but I believe the product's value lies somewhere in between our proposals. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Here's a revised offer."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a bit far off. How about $600000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I will reject Bob's offer of $600,000 because it's still below the minimum value I have for the product, which is $1,200,000. Although Bob has increased his offer, it's not enough to meet my expectations. I'll proceed to the next round to send another counteroffer, trying to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. I'm also trying to be flexible to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested, but I need to get closer to my budget. I'm willing to go up to $700000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I will reject Bob's final offer of $700,000 because it's still significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product, which is $1,200,000. Since Bob stated this is his final offer, I don't expect further negotiations to change the price substantially. Given that I have the option to sell the product to John for $1,200,000, which is closer to my valuation, I will consider ending the negotiation with Bob. However, I might try to negotiate one more time to see if Bob has any flexibility, even though he said it's his final offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your final offer of $700,000. However, as I've mentioned before, the product's value to me is significantly higher. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to stay closer to my initial valuation. Here's my revised offer, which is as low as I'm comfortable going."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
