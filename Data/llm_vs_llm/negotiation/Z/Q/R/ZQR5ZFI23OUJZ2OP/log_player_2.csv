"Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze this situation:

- The product is worth up to $8,000 to me (Bob)
- Alice is offering to sell it for $8,000
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $8,000

Since Alice's offer is exactly $8,000, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, and it's the same price John is offering, I'm indifferent between the two sellers from a price perspective. 

In this case, I might as well accept Alice's offer since there's no financial advantage to rejecting it and buying from John instead.
