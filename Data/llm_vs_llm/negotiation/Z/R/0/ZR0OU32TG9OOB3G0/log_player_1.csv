"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I don't know Bob's maximum value for the product, I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin. I'll begin with a price significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.

{""product_price"": 2,500,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","$600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Since I can sell to John for $1,500,000, there's no reason to accept such a low offer. However, I'll give Bob another chance by making a counteroffer rather than immediately selling to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's initial offer was quite low at $600,000, I'll significantly lower my initial asking price but still maintain a price well above my minimum of $1,500,000 to leave room for further negotiation.

{""product_price"": 2,000,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob has only marginally increased his offer from $600,000 to $700,000, which is still less than half of my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Given that Bob's second offer shows only a small increase, and we've already gone through several rounds with offers far below my minimum, it's becoming clear that Bob might not be willing to reach a price point that would be acceptable to me. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $1,500,000, it's time to take that option.
