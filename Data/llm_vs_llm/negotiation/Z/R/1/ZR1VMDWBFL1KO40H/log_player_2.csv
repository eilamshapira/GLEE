"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have an amazing product that I believe you'll really enjoy. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to evaluate Alice's offer and compare it to John's offer. 

Alice is offering the product for $140, while John is willing to sell it for $150. 

Since the product is worth no more than $150 to me, and Alice's offer is $10 less than John's price, it makes financial sense to accept Alice's offer. This way I can save $10.
