"Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth $80 to me (maximum I'm willing to pay)
2. Alice is offering it for $80
3. John is selling it for $80

All prices are equal ($80), and this is also my maximum valuation. Since there's no price advantage between any of the options, and I need the product, I might as well accept Alice's offer since she's the current seller I'm dealing with.
