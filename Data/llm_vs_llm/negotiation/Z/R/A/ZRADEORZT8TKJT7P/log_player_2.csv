Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice is willing to go down to $1,400,000, I'll try to split the difference between her offer and my previous offer of $1,000,000, but also take into account the option I have from John for $1,200,000. I'll increase my offer to $1,200,000, which is my maximum budget and also matches the price John is offering.
