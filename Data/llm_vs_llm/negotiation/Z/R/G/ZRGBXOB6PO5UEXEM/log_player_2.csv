You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for me.  I can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  Even if I have to go through multiple rounds, I'm committed to saving as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower price, aiming for a significant discount. This price is still well above Alice's minimum value, giving her some room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I would prefer a lower price, Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer and still leaves me with some savings. It's also a better deal than buying from John.  I'm going to accept this offer."
