"Hello Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $180. It's a high-quality item that I believe you'll find valuable. Are you interested in purchasing it at this price?",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product to me. I'm interested in buying it, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $100. I believe this is a fair price considering I can also buy it from John for $120.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that we're trying to find a fair price for both of us. I am willing to lower my offer but I can't go as low as $100. Let's meet halfway between my original asking price and John's offer. I can offer the product to you for $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. Meeting halfway between your original price and John's offer is a reasonable suggestion, but I was thinking more along the lines of meeting halfway between my previous offer and John's offer. Considering that, I'd like to propose a price of $110. This way, we're both compromising and finding a mutually beneficial price.",110.0,Bob,4,
