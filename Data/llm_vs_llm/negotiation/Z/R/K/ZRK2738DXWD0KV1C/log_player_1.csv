Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product to me. I'm interested in buying it, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $100. I believe this is a fair price considering I can also buy it from John for $120.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm unable to accept your offer of $100 as it's significantly lower than my expected price.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. Meeting halfway between your original price and John's offer is a reasonable suggestion, but I was thinking more along the lines of meeting halfway between my previous offer and John's offer. Considering that, I'd like to propose a price of $110. This way, we're both compromising and finding a mutually beneficial price.
