"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and John's offer of $15,000, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

My counteroffer for Round 2 is: $14,000

I hope this will bring Bob closer to my target price.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $10,500 is still lower than my target price, but it's getting closer. Since I have 6 more rounds to negotiate, I'll try to get an even better price from Bob.

My counteroffer for Round 4 is: $13,500

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","It seems like Bob has lowered his offer back to $10,000, which is the same as his initial valuation of the product. This suggests that he may not be willing to budge much further.

Considering I have 4 more rounds to negotiate, but Bob's offer is still quite low, I think it's time to consider selling to John for $15,000, which is a guaranteed deal.
