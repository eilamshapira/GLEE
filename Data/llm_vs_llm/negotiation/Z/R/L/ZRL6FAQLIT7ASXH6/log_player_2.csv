"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Given the offer of $15,000 and knowing my maximum willingness to pay is also $15,000, I am indifferent between accepting Alice's offer and buying from John. However, to potentially save money, I should reject the offer and make a counteroffer. Therefore, I will choose option (2).
