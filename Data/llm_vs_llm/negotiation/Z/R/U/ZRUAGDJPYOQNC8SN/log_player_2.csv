"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I should reject Alice's offer since it's significantly higher than John's price of $10,000. In fact, Alice's offer of $25,000 is even higher than the maximum value of the product to me ($10,000).

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for $10,000, I should offer Alice significantly less to make the deal attractive for me. I'll start with a low counteroffer to leave room for negotiation.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $20,000 is still double the price that John is offering ($10,000) and double what the product is worth to me. Since John's offer is still much better, I should reject Alice's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice reduced her price by $5,000 in her last offer, she seems willing to negotiate. However, her offer is still well above John's price of $10,000. I'll increase my offer slightly but still ensure it's below John's price to keep the deal attractive for me.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's offer has come down to $18,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but it's still significantly higher than John's price of $10,000. Since John's offer remains much better and the product is only worth up to $10,000 to me, I should reject Alice's offer.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice continues to lower her price, but she's still well above John's offer. I'll raise my offer a bit more to show I'm negotiating in good faith, but I need to keep it below $10,000 to make it worthwhile for me.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","We're in round 8 now with only a few rounds left. Alice has been gradually lowering her price, but she's still well above John's offer. I'll make my final meaningful counteroffer, very close to but still below John's price.
