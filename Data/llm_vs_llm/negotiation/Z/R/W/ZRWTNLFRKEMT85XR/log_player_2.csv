"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I'm willing to let it go for $12000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $12,000, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $8,000.
