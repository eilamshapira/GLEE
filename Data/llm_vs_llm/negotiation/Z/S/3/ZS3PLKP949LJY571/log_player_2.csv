"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,499,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,499,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $1,499,999
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $1,000,000

The logical choice would be to buy from John since:
- John's price ($1,000,000) matches the maximum value I place on the product
- Alice's price ($1,499,999) is significantly higher than my maximum valuation
- I would lose $499,999 by accepting Alice's offer
