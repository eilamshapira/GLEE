"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive rights to this incredible product. Considering its unique value and potential, I'm willing to let it go for $3000000. What do you say?",3000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a price that's significantly lower. I believe $800000 is a fair price for this product, considering I can also get it from another seller for that amount.",400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, your offer of $400000 is simply too low, and doesn't reflect the true value of the product. I am confident in its unique value and I am willing to go down to $2800000. This is a firm price, and I believe is a fair and profitable deal for both of us.",2800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2800000 is still out of my budget. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering I have another option to buy the product for $800000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer $1200000 for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for the increased offer. While I understand your position, and I'm happy we're getting closer, I still think the value of the product warrants a slightly higher price. I'm willing to come down further to $2000000. This is my final offer.",2000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer of $2000000, but it's still above my comfortable price range. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product, but I need to feel like I'm getting a fair deal. Considering my alternative option is $800000, I'd like to offer $1400000 as a compromise. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I hope it demonstrates my genuine interest in the product.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
