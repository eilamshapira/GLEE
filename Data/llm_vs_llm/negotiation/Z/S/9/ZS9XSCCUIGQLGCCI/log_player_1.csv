Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive rights to this incredible product. Considering its unique value and potential, I'm willing to let it go for $3,000,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a price that's significantly lower. I believe $800000 is a fair price for this product, considering I can also get it from another seller for that amount. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","This is a tough one! Bob is lowballing, and his counteroffer is far below my minimum. However, I also don't want to lose the potential of a much higher sale.

My decision is to: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your interest, your offer of $400,000 is simply too low, and doesn't reflect the true value of the product. I am confident in its unique value and I am willing to go down to $2,800,000. This is a firm price, and I believe is a fair and profitable deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 2800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2800000 is still out of my budget. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering I have another option to buy the product for $800000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer $1200000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's getting closer, but I still need to maximize my profit. His offer is above my minimum, but I think I can push for more.

My decision is to: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for the increased offer. While I understand your position, and I'm happy we're getting closer, I still think the value of the product warrants a slightly higher price. I'm willing to come down further to $2,000,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your final offer of $2000000, but it's still above my comfortable price range. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product, but I need to feel like I'm getting a fair deal. Considering my alternative option is $800000, I'd like to offer $1400000 as a compromise. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I hope it demonstrates my genuine interest in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob is still low, but he's coming up a bit. $1,400,000 is better than $1,000,000, but I'm still not getting as much as I would like. However, I don't want to push my luck and lose the sale entirely. At this point, my risk is not worth a higher price.
