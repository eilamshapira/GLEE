"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a premium product that I'd like to offer you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $22500. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you like to proceed with the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $8,000
2. Alice is offering the product for $22,500, which is significantly higher than my maximum value
3. John is offering the product for $8,000, which matches my maximum value

Since Alice's offer ($22,500) is much higher than both:
- My maximum value ($8,000)
- John's alternative offer ($8,000)

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer as it would be a significant overpayment. The best option is to buy from John.
