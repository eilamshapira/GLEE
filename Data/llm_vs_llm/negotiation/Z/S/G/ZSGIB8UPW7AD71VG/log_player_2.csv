"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $2,300,000 is more than twice the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,000,000), it's not a good deal for me. I can get the product from John for $1,000,000, which is a much better option.
