"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll reject Alice's offer of $14,000 since it's quite close to John's price of $15,000, and I know the product is worth only $8,000 to Alice. This gives me room to negotiate for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice and $15,000 is my maximum value, I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation. I'll offer slightly above Alice's cost.

{""product_price"": 9500}

This offer gives Alice a reasonable profit margin ($1,500) above their cost while still being significantly below both their initial offer and John's price, leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced the price by $1,000, which shows willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still quite high considering the product's cost to Alice is $8,000. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still maintain a good margin for negotiation. Since Alice came down $1,000, I'll move up by a similar amount from my last offer.

{""product_price"": 10500}

This offer gives Alice a $2,500 profit (more than 30% above their cost) while still being significantly below their last offer of $13,000. It shows I'm willing to move up but maintains a strong negotiating position."
