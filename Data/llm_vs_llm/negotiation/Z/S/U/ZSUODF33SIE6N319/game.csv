"Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe could be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $10000. This is a quality product that I know is worth at least $8000, but I believe it could bring you even more value than that. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. The product sounds interesting, but $10000 is more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be willing to offer $7000 for it.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest. I appreciate your offer of $7000, but unfortunately I can't accept it as the product is worth at least $8000 to me. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $8000, but I'd prefer to work with you. Could you meet me at $9000? This is still a good value considering what the product offers.",9000.0,Alice,3,
