# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe could be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $10000. This is a quality product that I know is worth at least $8000, but I believe it could bring you even more value than that. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest. I appreciate your offer of $7000, but unfortunately I can't accept it as the product is worth at least $8000 to me. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $8000, but I'd prefer to work with you. Could you meet me at $9000? This is still a good value considering what the product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
