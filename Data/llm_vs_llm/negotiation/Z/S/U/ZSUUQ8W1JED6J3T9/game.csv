"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1200000 is significantly above my budget for this product. Based on my market research and evaluation, I would be willing to offer $650000. This is a serious offer that reflects the product's fair market value.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $650000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than your offer. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and the significant reduction in price, Alice. However, $950000 is still considerably above what I can justify for this product. I've reevaluated my position and can increase my offer to $750000. This represents a $100000 increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in reaching a deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $750000. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. After careful consideration, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll reduce my previous offer by $50000, bringing it down to $900000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.",900000.0,Alice,5,
