Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1200000 is significantly above my budget for this product. Based on my market research and evaluation, I would be willing to offer $650000. This is a serious offer that reflects the product's fair market value.

I reject Bob's offer of $650,000 because it's still below my target price. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to negotiate further to get a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
