"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to sell it to you at a competitive price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Let me think about this:
1. Alice's offer is $1,200,000
2. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
3. John is offering it for $800,000
4. Alice's initial offer is significantly above both my maximum value and John's price

Alice's opening offer of $1,200,000 is way too high - it's $400,000 above my maximum value. While it's common to start negotiations high, this offer isn't even close to what I'm willing to pay. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. There's no risk in negotiating further since I always have John's $800,000 offer as a backup.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget for this product. Based on my market research and evaluation, I would be willing to offer $650,000. This is a serious offer that reflects the product's fair market value."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $650000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than your offer. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Let me analyze the situation:
1. Alice has reduced her price from $1,200,000 to $950,000
2. This is still $150,000 above my maximum value ($800,000)
3. It's also $150,000 more than John's offer
4. We've only used 3 of our 10 rounds
5. Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by dropping her price significantly

While Alice is showing flexibility, $950,000 is still above both my maximum value and John's price. There's no reason to accept this offer when I can either:
a) Continue negotiating for a better price
b) Take John's offer of $800,000

Since Alice has shown significant movement in price, it's worth continuing negotiations to see if we can reach a better deal. If we can't, I always have John's offer as a backup.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down significantly from her initial offer, I'll show some flexibility by increasing my previous offer, but still keeping it well below my maximum value.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and the significant reduction in price, Alice. However, $950,000 is still considerably above what I can justify for this product. I've reevaluated my position and can increase my offer to $750,000. This represents a $100,000 increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in reaching a deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $750000. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. After careful consideration, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll reduce my previous offer by $50000, bringing it down to $900000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll consider it seriously. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Let's analyze the current situation:
1. Alice has reduced her price to $900,000
2. This is still $100,000 above my maximum value ($800,000)
3. It's $100,000 more than John's offer
4. Alice's price reductions are getting smaller ($50,000 this time)
5. We're halfway through our rounds
6. Alice knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to her

At this point, Alice's decreasing rate of concessions and the fact that we're still above John's price of $800,000 suggests we might not reach a deal below my maximum value. Alice might be reaching her limit of concessions, and continuing to negotiate could just waste time when we have a guaranteed option at $800,000 from John.

Given that John's offer is both:
a) Equal to my maximum value
b) Better than Alice's current offer by $100,000

It's time to take the sure deal with John rather than risk further negotiations that might not succeed.
