"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: $1,200,000
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John: $1,500,000

Since I want to save money and the product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, I should choose the lowest price available. Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is $300,000 less than John's price of $1,500,000. Therefore, accepting Alice's offer would be the most economical choice.
