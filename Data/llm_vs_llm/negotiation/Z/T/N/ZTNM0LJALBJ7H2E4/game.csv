"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I appreciate its value,  $9500 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $6000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $6000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid that price is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $9000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with at the moment, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I can go up to $6500.  This is a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",6500.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $6500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still feel that the price is a bit too low. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $8800. This is a significant reduction from my original price, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's value.",8800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm still very interested. How about $7000? That's a substantial increase on my previous offer and should be a win-win for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $7000. I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to increase your offer. However, I still believe the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer, and sell the product to you for $8400. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",8400.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  To be completely transparent, I've got another offer for $8000.  I'd prefer to buy from you, but I'm only willing to go up to $7200.  This is my final offer â€“ let me know if it works for you.",7200.0,Bob,8,
