"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is too low for this product. I have another buyer willing to pay $10000, so I cannot go below that price. However, given our ongoing negotiation, I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price. I can offer you the product for $12000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.",12000.0,Alice,3,
