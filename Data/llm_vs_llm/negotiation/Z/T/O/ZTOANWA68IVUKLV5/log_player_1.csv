Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential value to you."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I think $15000 is too high. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and even below what John is willing to pay. I'll make a new counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is too low for this product. I have another buyer willing to pay $10,000, so I cannot go below that price. However, given our ongoing negotiation, I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price. I can offer you the product for $12,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think $12000 is too much. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Since Bob is now offering $10,000, which is equal to John's offer and my minimum acceptable price, I'll accept Bob's offer. There's no advantage in continuing negotiations or switching to John as we've reached a fair price."
