"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is significantly above my budget. I should mention that I have another seller, John, who's offering me the same product for $15000. I value our potential business relationship, so I'd like to buy from you instead if possible. I can offer $12000 for the product, which would give you a chance to make the sale while saving me some money compared to my alternative option.",12000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your situation, I need to maintain a minimum price for the product. I can go down to $18000, which is still a competitive price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",18000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $16500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and should be more in line with your budget while still reflecting the product's worth. What do you say?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I should be transparent that John is still offering this product to me for $15000 firm. For me to choose to do business with you instead, I'd need a better price than that alternative. Would you consider $13500? This would give you a reasonable profit while giving me a financial incentive to choose you over the other seller.",13500.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your transparency and your offer. However, I need to maintain a price that reflects the product's value. I can go down to $15500, which is very close to your alternative offer but still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin. Let me know if this works for you.",15500.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand the pressure from your alternative offer. I'm willing to match John's price to secure our business relationship. I can offer the product for $15000. This is the best I can do while ensuring I meet my minimum requirements. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,5,
