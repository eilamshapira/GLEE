Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is significantly above my budget. I should mention that I have another seller, John, who's offering me the same product for $15000. I value our potential business relationship, so I'd like to buy from you instead if possible. I can offer $12000 for the product, which would give you a chance to make the sale while saving me some money compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I should be transparent that John is still offering this product to me for $15000 firm. For me to choose to do business with you instead, I'd need a better price than that alternative. Would you consider $13500? This would give you a reasonable profit while giving me a financial incentive to choose you over the other seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500.
