"Alice's offer: The product price will be $240. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $240
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer ($240) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($100) and John's offer ($100), it would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. 

The best decision is to buy from John for $100, as this price matches my maximum value and ensures I get the product I need while saving money compared to Alice's offer.
