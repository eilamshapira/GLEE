"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider selling it for $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $75, that's actually below my cost for the item. I can come down to $130, which is already a good discount from my initial offer. This is a quality product that I'm confident will provide you with great value. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice. $130 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
