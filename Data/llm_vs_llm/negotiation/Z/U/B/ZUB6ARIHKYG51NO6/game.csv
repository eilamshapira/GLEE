"Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering the alternative I have available and my valuation of this product, I can only justify an offer of $500000. I see this as a fair starting point for our negotiations and look forward to your response.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that we have different valuations of the product, but I'm afraid $500000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a more serious offer. I'm reducing my initial price, but I still believe the product is worth significantly more.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
