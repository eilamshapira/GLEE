Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering the alternative I have available and my valuation of this product, I can only justify an offer of $500000. I see this as a fair starting point for our negotiations and look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I will reject Bob's offer of $500,000 and proceed to the next round to send a counteroffer. Since the product is worth no less than $1,200,000 to me, I will try to negotiate a better price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that we have different valuations of the product, but I'm afraid $500,000 is too low for me.
