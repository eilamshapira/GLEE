"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $900,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept this offer. I have two reasonable options:
1. Make a counteroffer to Alice, hoping to negotiate a better price
2. Buy from John immediately for $800,000

Since John's price matches my maximum value, and there's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower price, the safest and most logical choice is to buy from John.
