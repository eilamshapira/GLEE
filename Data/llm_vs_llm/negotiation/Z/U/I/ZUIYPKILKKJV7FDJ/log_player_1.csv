"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth $12,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at $12,000, I'll start with a high offer to Bob to see if there's potential for profit above my minimum acceptable price.

{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and even below his own valuation of $8,000. There's no reason to accept such a low offer when I have John's guaranteed offer at $12,000.

However, since we're only in round 2 and have several rounds remaining, I'll reject and make a counter-offer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's previous offer was quite low at $6,000, and knowing the product is worth $8,000 to him, I'll lower my price from my initial offer but still keep it above Bob's valuation to see if we can move towards a middle ground.

{""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's new offer of $7,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and I have John's guaranteed offer at $12,000. Bob's offers are only increasing slowly, and given that the product is only worth $8,000 to him, it's unlikely he'll ever offer more than $8,000. Since we've already gone through 4 rounds and the gap between our positions is still very large, it's best to take John's guaranteed offer now.
