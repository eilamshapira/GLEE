Round 6
Bob's offer:

I reject Bob's offer of $1,200,000 because, although it's the highest he's offered so far and matches the value he initially stated the product is worth to him, it's still lower than the price John is willing to pay. Since I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, I will hold out for a better offer from Bob or sell to John if the negotiations don't improve."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate that you've increased your price to $1,200,000, which I understand is the value you believe the product is worth to you.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make a concession. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. Since I've already reached my maximum budget of $1200000, I'd like to make a final counteroffer, hoping we can meet in the middle. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Since Bob has stated that $1,200,000 is his maximum budget and he's not willing to go higher, and I've already made significant concessions, I decide to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This price is higher than Bob's final offer and meets my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I get the best value for the product. Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a better result, so selling to John is the most profitable option."
