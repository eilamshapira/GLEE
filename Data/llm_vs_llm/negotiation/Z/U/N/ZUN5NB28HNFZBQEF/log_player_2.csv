"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is offering a product for $2,000,000, which is clearly above my maximum value of $1,000,000. Since I can buy the same product from John for exactly $1,000,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer which is double that amount.

I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer that's below $1,000,000, since any price lower than John's would be beneficial for me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has reduced her offer, but $1,750,000 is still significantly above John's price of $1,000,000. Since I'm trying to save as much money as possible and the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, there's no reason to accept this offer.

I should reject and continue negotiating with a higher counteroffer than my previous one, but still below John's price.

Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and my goal is to save as much money as possible, I should not accept this offer.

I'll continue negotiating by rejecting Alice's offer.
