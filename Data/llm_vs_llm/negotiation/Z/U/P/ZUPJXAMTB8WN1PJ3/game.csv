"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend. Based on my research and budget, I can offer $60 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you have a budget constraint, but $60 is too low for this product. My cost for this product is $100, so I cannot go below that price. Given the quality and value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $175. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents good value for what you're getting.",175.0,Alice,3,
