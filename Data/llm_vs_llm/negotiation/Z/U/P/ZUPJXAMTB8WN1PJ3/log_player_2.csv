"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I hope you're doing well. I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it for $200. This is a quality product that I'm confident you'll find worth the investment. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given that my maximum value for the product is $100, and John is willing to sell it for $100, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $200. Since there are still 9 rounds left for negotiation, it's worth trying to get a better deal from Alice before defaulting to John's option.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since my maximum value is $100 and I have John's offer as a backup, I'll start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend. Based on my research and budget, I can offer $60 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you have a budget constraint, but $60 is too low for this product. My cost for this product is $100, so I cannot go below that price. Given the quality and value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $175. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents good value for what you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice has revealed that her cost is $100, and coincidentally that's the same as John's offer and my maximum value, there's no reason to continue negotiating. Alice has stated she cannot go below $100, and her current offer of $175 is still well above my maximum value of $100. The best decision is to buy from John.
