"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering the product for $9,500
3. John is willing to sell it for $8,000
4. If I accept Alice's offer, I would be paying $1,500 more than what I value the product at
5. If I buy from John, I would be paying exactly what I value the product at

Since Alice's offer ($9,500) is higher than my maximum valuation ($8,000), and I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $8,000, the rational choice would be to buy from John.
