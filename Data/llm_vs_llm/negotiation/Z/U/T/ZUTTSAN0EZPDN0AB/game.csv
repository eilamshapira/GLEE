"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm certainly interested in the product, $950000 is quite steep. The market value for similar products is substantially lower. I'm prepared to offer $825000, which I believe is fair and provides you with a good profit margin. I'm looking forward to doing business with you, but I need a more competitive price to move forward.",825000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $825000 is below what I believe the product is worth to both of us. I'm willing to come down to $900000, which still offers you a great deal while ensuring I receive a fair value for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to lower the price further to $875000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my desire to close this deal with you. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. That shows good faith in our negotiation. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I've done my research on the market value of this product, and I'm prepared to offer $840000. This gives you a solid profit while also making it worthwhile for me. I value building a business relationship with you, but I also need to be mindful of my budget constraints.",840000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I appreciate your latest offer and your commitment to finding a fair price. However, I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $860000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my part and should be within your budget while still recognizing the product's worth. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",860000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it's clear we're both interested in making this work. I'm willing to come down to $850000, which I believe is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and your budget constraints. Let's close this deal at $850000 and move forward together.",850000.0,Alice,5,
