Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to get closer to the product's value to him. My next offer will be $1,000,000. This is still below what the product is worth to Bob, but higher than his current offer, trying to find a mutually beneficial price."
