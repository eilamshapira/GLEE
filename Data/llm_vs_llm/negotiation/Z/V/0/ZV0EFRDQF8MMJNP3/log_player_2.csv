"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price.  How does $12000 sound?  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me. Alice is offering it for $12,000. If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy the same product from John for $8,000. Since $8,000 is less than $12,000, I should reject Alice's offer and buy from John.
