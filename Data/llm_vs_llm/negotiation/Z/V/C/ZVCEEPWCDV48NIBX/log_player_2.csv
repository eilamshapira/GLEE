"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Based on the information provided, I should analyze my options:

1. Accept Alice's offer to buy the product for $2,000,000
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy the product from John for $800,000

Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and John is offering it at exactly $800,000, Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation and my alternative option. The rational choice is to buy from John instead.
