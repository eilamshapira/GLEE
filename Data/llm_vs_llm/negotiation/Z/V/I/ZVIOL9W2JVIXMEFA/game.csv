"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique and valuable product. Given its unparalleled qualities and potential return, I'm initially pricing it at $2500000. I believe this investment will be significantly beneficial to you.",2500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, the initial price is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $750000 for it, considering its potential value to me. Let me know if this works for you.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $750000 is far below the product's intrinsic value. However, I am willing to negotiate. I can offer you the product for $2450000.",2450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but $2450000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800000. This is a fair price considering my budget constraints. Please let me know if we can meet in the middle.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is still significantly lower than what I can accept. I'm willing to come down further, to $2400000.",2400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2400000 is still out of my reach. I can go up to $850000, which is the highest I can offer while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your continued interest. While I appreciate you increasing your offer to $850000, it's still too far from my minimum acceptable price. I can lower my offer to $2300000.",2300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see that we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit more and offer $900000. This is a significant increase from my previous offers, and I hope it shows my commitment to finding a deal that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I acknowledge the significant increase in your offer to $900000. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. My counteroffer is $2200000.",2200000.0,Alice,9,
