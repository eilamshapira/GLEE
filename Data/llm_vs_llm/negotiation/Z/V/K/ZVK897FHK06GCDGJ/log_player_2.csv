"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not a good idea to accept Alice's offer at $1,200,000 since you're willing to pay only $1,000,000 for the product. Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to negotiate with Alice or buy from John for your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
