"Hi Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but $16000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? I think this is a fair price and would allow me to proceed with the purchase.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14500.
