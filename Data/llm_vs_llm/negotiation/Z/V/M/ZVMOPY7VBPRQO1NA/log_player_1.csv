Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $18,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to counter with $12000. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer is equal to the minimum amount I'm willing to accept from John, and I believe the product is worth more, I'll try to negotiate further to see if Bob is willing to increase his offer. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000, considering its value and uniqueness. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but $16000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? I think this is a fair price and would allow me to proceed with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $13,500 is higher than John's offer of $12,000, it's a better option. However, I still believe the product is worth more, and I'd like to try to negotiate further to see if Bob is willing to increase his offer.

Next, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,500. This price is closer to what I believe the product is worth, and I'm willing to consider it a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
