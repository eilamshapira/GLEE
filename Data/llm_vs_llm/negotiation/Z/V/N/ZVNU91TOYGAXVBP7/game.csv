"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm glad we can continue the discussion. While I understand that $7500 is a significant offer, I was thinking more along the lines of $10500. However, I'm willing to make a concession and meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I'd be willing to let the product go for $9250. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer and for being willing to meet me halfway. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I was thinking that we could meet closer to my initial offer. I'd be willing to increase my offer to $8200. I believe this is a reasonable price, considering we're both trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",8200.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, I still believe that $8200 is slightly below the product's value. Considering we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement, I'd be willing to make another concession. I'd be willing to let the product go for $9000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,
