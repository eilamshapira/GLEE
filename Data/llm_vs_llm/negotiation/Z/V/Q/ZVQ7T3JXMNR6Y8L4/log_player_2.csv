"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a premium product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm willing to sell it for $350. This is a high-quality item that many would consider worth much more. If you're interested, let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $120 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $350, which is significantly higher than my maximum value
3. John is willing to sell it for $120, which matches my maximum value

It's clear that Alice's offer of $350 is not a good deal for me. Since I can get the same product from John for $120, which is the maximum I value it at, I should go with John's offer.
