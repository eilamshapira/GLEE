"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is too low for me. I can come down to $175.  This product is really worth it.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $175 is still too high for me. How about we settle at $85? I think that's a fair price considering my budget constraints.",85.0,Bob,4,
