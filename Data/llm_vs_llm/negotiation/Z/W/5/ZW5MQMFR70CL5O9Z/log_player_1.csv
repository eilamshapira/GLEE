Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my offer to Bob. The product is worth $15,000 to me, and I can always sell it to John for that amount. However, Bob values it at only $8,000, which means there's no zone of possible agreement between us (since I won't go below $15,000 and he won't go above $8,000).

Given this situation, I should just offer Bob a price that maintains my dignity as a seller while being prepared to ultimately sell to John.
