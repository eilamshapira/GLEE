"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire this exceptional product. I'm offering it to you at the competitive price of $2000000. This product has high value and potential for your portfolio. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since the price Alice is offering ($2,000,000) is higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,500,000), it makes sense to explore other options that fit within my budget.
