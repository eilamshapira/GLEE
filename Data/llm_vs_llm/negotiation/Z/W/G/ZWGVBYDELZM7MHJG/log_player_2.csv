"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer is $100, which is the same price as John's offer, and this price equals my maximum valuation, there's no advantage in negotiating further. Whether I accept Alice's offer or buy from John, I'll pay the same price. However, since we're already in conversation with Alice, I might as well accept her offer rather than going to John.
