"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its market value and potential, I'm offering it at $1450000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and benefits.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, I believe $1450000 is too high considering market conditions. I'd like to propose $1300000, which would still provide you with a good profit margin while being more aligned with my budget. This offer represents a fair middle ground for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1300000 is too low considering the product's value and market positioning. I can come down from my initial offer to $1400000, which represents a $50000 reduction and is still a good value given that this product will generate significant returns for you. This price point better reflects the true worth of the product while still leaving room for your profit margin.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1400000 is still quite high. I can increase my previous offer to $1340000, which represents a significant increase from my last offer and would provide you with a healthy profit margin. This price point would make the deal work well for both of us.",1340000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. While we're moving in the right direction, I believe we can find a price point that better serves both our interests. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1375000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer and provides you with substantial value given the product's worth. This price point strikes a fair balance between your budget concerns and the product's true market value.",1375000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your continued flexibility, Alice. Your movement shows we're getting closer to finding common ground. I can increase my offer to $1360000, which splits our remaining difference quite fairly. This represents a meaningful increase from my last offer and would still give you a substantial profit while being a reasonable price for me. Given that we're both moving closer to agreement, I believe this is a fair compromise.",1360000.0,Bob,6,
