Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically.

Bob values the product at $1,500,000, and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $1,500,000. Since Bob won't pay more than what the product is worth to him, and I already have a guaranteed offer at $1,500,000, I should offer Bob the product at exactly $1,500,000.

If I ask for more, Bob will definitely reject it since it exceeds his valuation. If I ask for less, I'm leaving money on the table since I can get $1,500,000 from John.
