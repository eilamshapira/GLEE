"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $950000 is quite high considering the market value of this product. I'd like to propose $850000, which would still provide you with a good profit margin while being more reasonable for me. This offer would allow us to close the deal quickly and benefit both parties.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This price still gives you a good deal, considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. You've moved $50000, showing good faith. I'm also willing to move up from my previous offer. Let's meet in the middle at $875000. This gives you a very healthy profit margin while still being a fair price for me. What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you want to make a deal, and I do too. However, $875000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $890000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us to close the deal quickly. What do you think?",890000.0,Alice,5,
