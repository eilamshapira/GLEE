Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $950000 is quite high considering the market value of this product. I'd like to propose $850000, which would still provide you with a good profit margin while being more reasonable for me. This offer would allow us to close the deal quickly and benefit both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
