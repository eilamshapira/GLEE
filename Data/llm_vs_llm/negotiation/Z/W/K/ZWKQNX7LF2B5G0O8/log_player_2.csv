"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's offer is $950,000
2. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me
3. I know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice
4. John's fixed price is $1,000,000
5. I have 10 rounds to negotiate

Alice's first offer at $950,000 is quite high, especially knowing her cost is $800,000. There's significant room for negotiation, and I have many rounds left. Since Alice's offer is already below John's price, I'm in a good position to negotiate further down.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's $950,000 but still provides her with a decent profit margin above her $800,000 cost.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $950,000 is quite high considering the market value of this product. I'd like to propose $850,000, which would still provide you with a good profit margin while being more reasonable for me. This offer would allow us to close the deal quickly and benefit both parties."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This price still gives you a good deal, considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice has moved down from $950,000 to $900,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. My offer of $850,000 was rejected
3. We still have plenty of rounds left (7 more after this)
4. The $900,000 offer is still significantly better than John's $1,000,000
5. Alice's cost is $800,000, so she's seeking a $100,000 profit

While $900,000 is better, there's still room for negotiation. Alice has shown flexibility by reducing her price by $50,000, so let's continue negotiating to try to meet somewhere in the middle between $850,000 and $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down $50,000 from her initial offer, and I want to show good faith in the negotiation, I'll increase my previous offer by moving up halfway between our current positions.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. You've moved $50,000, showing good faith. I'm also willing to move up from my previous offer. Let's meet in the middle at $875,000. This gives you a very healthy profit margin while still being a fair price for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want to make a deal, and I do too. However, $875000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $890000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us to close the deal quickly. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Initial offers: Alice $950,000 → $900,000 → $890,000
2. My offers: $850,000 → $875,000
3. Alice has moved down $60,000 in total
4. The gap between our last positions is now only $15,000 ($890,000 vs $875,000)
5. We're halfway through our rounds (5 out of 10)
6. $890,000 is still $110,000 better than John's price

Alice is showing consistent willingness to negotiate and has made meaningful concessions. The gap is getting quite small, and while we could potentially negotiate further, the risk of losing time and potentially needing to pay $1,000,000 to John outweighs the potential benefit of saving a few thousand more dollars. This is a reasonable price point that represents a good compromise.
