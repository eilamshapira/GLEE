Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that the product is worth at least $800,000 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price, I'll start with a higher offer to Bob to leave room for potential negotiation while ensuring I get good value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $700,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 (which I can get from John), and it's significantly lower than my initial offer, I'll reject this offer. However, rather than continue negotiating with Bob who seems to be offering below my minimum threshold, it would be more prudent to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John.
