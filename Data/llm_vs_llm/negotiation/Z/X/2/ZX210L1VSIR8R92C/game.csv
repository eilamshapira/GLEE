"Hi Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I believe it has potential, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $600000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to negotiate further.  How about we meet in the middle at $1050000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1050000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your counteroffer. How about $700000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $700000 is still far below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go down to $900000,  which is a significant drop from my last offer.  This price reflects the value of the product while still allowing for some room for compromise. Let's try to close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
