"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer was $1,500,000, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower, but still shows that I'm interested in the product. I'll offer $600,000, which is below my maximum budget of $800,000.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I believe it has potential, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $600000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to negotiate further.  How about we meet in the middle at $1050000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's counteroffer was $1,050,000, which is still above my budget, I'll try to bring the price down further. I'll offer $700,000, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but still below my maximum budget of $800,000. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and meet Alice halfway, but I'm not willing to go above my budget.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your counteroffer. How about $700,000?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $700000 is still far below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go down to $900000,  which is a significant drop from my last offer.  This price reflects the value of the product while still allowing for some room for compromise. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000, and I have the option to buy the product from John for $800,000, I'll choose to buy from John instead of continuing to negotiate with Alice.
