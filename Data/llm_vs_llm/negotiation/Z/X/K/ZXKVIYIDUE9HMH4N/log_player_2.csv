"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, and Alice's offer of $100 is higher than both my maximum value and John's price of $80, the rational decision would be to buy from John. This way, I'll save $20 compared to Alice's offer and still get the product at a price that matches my valuation.
