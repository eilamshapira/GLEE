"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's offer is $1,100,000
2. The product is worth $1,000,000 to me
3. John's fixed price is $1,000,000
4. We have 10 rounds of negotiation possible

Since Alice's initial offer ($1,100,000) is higher than both:
- The product's worth to me ($1,000,000)
- John's alternative offer ($1,000,000)

There's no reason to accept this offer. While I could negotiate with Alice, since John's price exactly matches my maximum value for the product, and is lower than Alice's current offer, it makes the most sense to take John's offer immediately.
