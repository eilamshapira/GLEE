"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and offer. I appreciate your budget considerations, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. Given that I have a standing offer of $800000 from another buyer, and knowing the premium quality of this product, I can come down to $1100000. This still represents excellent value for what you're getting, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
