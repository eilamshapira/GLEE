Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make a strategic decision about my offer price to Bob. The product is worth at least $8,000 to me, and I have John as a guaranteed backup buyer at exactly $8,000.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I need to balance between setting a price high enough to maximize my profit, but not so high that Bob will certainly reject it.

If I offer the product at a price too close to $8,000, I'm not gaining much advantage from negotiating with Bob instead of selling directly to John. On the other hand, a significantly higher price gives me potential for greater profit, with the safety net of John's offer if Bob declines.

I'll offer the product to Bob at a price that represents a meaningful premium over my guaranteed alternative.
