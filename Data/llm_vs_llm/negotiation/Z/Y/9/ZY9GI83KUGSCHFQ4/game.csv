"Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $700000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise and lower my initial price. I'd like to offer it to you for $920000, which I think is a more reasonable price for both of us.",920000.0,Alice,3,
