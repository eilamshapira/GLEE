Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you be willing to consider $700000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $700,000 is lower than what I can get from John ($800,000), and it's also lower than the product's worth to me, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try to get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $700,000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Although Bob's offer of $750,000 is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's still lower than what I can get from John ($800,000) and lower than the product's worth to me. I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try to get a better price, as I believe there's still room for negotiation."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $800,000 matches the price I can get from John, and considering that further negotiation may not yield a better result, I will accept Bob's offer and close the deal. This way, I can ensure a sale at a price that meets my minimum requirements."
