,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer, but $80 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to go down to $180. Let me know if that works for you.",180.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to stick to a price that reflects the value of the product. How about $160? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to come down a bit, but I'm still finding it hard to justify that price. How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say $120?",120.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to find a middle ground. I can come down to $150, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",150.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm willing to lower the price further to $140. This is a significant discount, and I believe it represents a fair value for both of us. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  I could go up to $110, but that's really pushing my budget.",110.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle. I can go down to $130, which is my final offer. This is a great deal, and I hope we can close on this price.",130.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm willing to make one last compromise at $130. This is the lowest I can go while still reflecting the value of the product. Let me know if you can accept this offer.",130.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this is a tough one.  $115 is absolutely the most I can do.  What do you say?",115.0,Bob,8,
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $115 is still below what I can accept. My final offer is $125. This is a fair price, and I hope we can agree on it.",125.0,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm firm on the value of the product. My final offer is $125. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price. Let me know if you can accept this.",125.0,Alice,9,
