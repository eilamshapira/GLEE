"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $20000 is more than I'm willing to pay at the moment. I'm happy to consider your product for $10000.  This is my maximum budget, and I'm confident it's a fair price given my evaluation of its value.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate and make a counteroffer of $18000. I think this price is more reflective of the product's worth, and I'm hoping we can meet at this point.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $18000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to go up to $12000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the value we've discussed.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",12000.0,Bob,4,
