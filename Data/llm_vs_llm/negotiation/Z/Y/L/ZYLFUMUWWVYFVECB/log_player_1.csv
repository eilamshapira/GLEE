Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $20000 is more than I'm willing to pay at the moment. I'm happy to consider your product for $10000.  This is my maximum budget, and I'm confident it's a fair price given my evaluation of its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. My counteroffer will be $18,000. This price still reflects the product's value and gives Bob a chance to reconsider his budget. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand that $20,000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate and make a counteroffer of $18,000. I think this price is more reflective of the product's worth, and I'm hoping we can meet at this point."", ""product_price"": 18000}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $18000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to go up to $12000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the value we've discussed.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Since Bob's offer of $12,000 matches the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and it's also the same price that John is offering, I'll accept Bob's offer. This way, I can finalize the sale and ensure I get a fair price for the product."
