"Hello Bob, I have a quality product that I'm offering to you today. Based on the market value and the features it offers, I'm setting the price at $120. This is a competitive price for a product of this quality. Are you interested in making this purchase?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $120 is beyond my budget. I'm actually considering buying this product from another seller for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a better price. Would you consider $80 for the product? This would be a fair price that works within my budget constraints.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $80 as that's my absolute minimum price point. The product is worth considerably more than that, and I already have another buyer willing to pay $80. Given the quality and value of this product, I can offer it to you for $110, which is already a good discount from my initial price. This is still better than the $100 you mentioned from another seller, and you'll be getting a superior product with me.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I need to be clear that I can purchase this exact same product from John for $100, not a different or inferior version. Since I can get it elsewhere for $100, I can't justify paying more than that. I'd really prefer to buy from you, so I'm offering $90. This gives you a better deal than your other buyer at $80, and gives me some savings compared to my alternative option. Does that work for you?",90.0,Bob,4,
