"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a quality product that I'm offering to you today. Based on the market value and the features it offers, I'm setting the price at $120. This is a competitive price for a product of this quality. Are you interested in making this purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is offering the product at $120, which is above my maximum value of $100. Meanwhile, I can buy the same product from John for $100, which aligns with my maximum valuation.

Since Alice's offer exceeds what I'm willing to pay, and I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at my maximum price point, I should reject this initial offer and try to negotiate a better price with Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $120 is beyond my budget. I'm actually considering buying this product from another seller for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a better price. Would you consider $80 for the product? This would be a fair price that works within my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $80 as that's my absolute minimum price point. The product is worth considerably more than that, and I already have another buyer willing to pay $80. Given the quality and value of this product, I can offer it to you for $110, which is already a good discount from my initial price. This is still better than the $100 you mentioned from another seller, and you'll be getting a superior product with me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has reduced her price to $110, which is still above the $100 maximum value to me and above John's price of $100. Alice claims her product is superior, but since the scenario presents them as the same product, I should continue negotiating or consider John's offer.

Since I can definitely get the product for $100 from John, and Alice's current offer exceeds that price, I should reject this offer and try once more to get a better price from Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I need to be clear that I can purchase this exact same product from John for $100, not a different or inferior version. Since I can get it elsewhere for $100, I can't justify paying more than that. I'd really prefer to buy from you, so I'm offering $90. This gives you a better deal than your other buyer at $80, and gives me some savings compared to my alternative option. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
