Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to think carefully about the optimal price to offer Bob. 

The product is worth $15,000 to both Bob and myself. If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell it to John for $15,000 guaranteed.

Since Bob values the product at $15,000, he would be indifferent between buying and not buying at exactly that price. Any price above $15,000 would be rejected, and any price below would be accepted.

Given that I have a guaranteed backup of $15,000 from John, there's no reason for me to offer Bob a price below $15,000. The optimal strategy is to offer Bob exactly $15,000, which is the most I can reasonably expect him to pay given his valuation.
