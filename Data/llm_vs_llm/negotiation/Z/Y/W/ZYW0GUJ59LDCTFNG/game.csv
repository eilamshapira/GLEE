"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10000, considering the product's value and my own budget constraints.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal. Considering the value, I can come down a bit, but I can't go as low as $10000. How about $14000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $11000, which is closer to my budget and takes into account the product's value.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget. Considering the situation, I'm willing to meet you closer to your offer, but not quite at $11000. How about $13000? This is my absolute lowest price.",13000.0,Alice,5,
