"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. That price is way too high for me, but I believe this product could be a good fit for my needs. I'm willing to offer $500000 to start the negotiations.",500000.0,Bob,2,
"Bob, I appreciate your initial offer, but $500000 is far below the value of this exclusive product. I’m counteroffering at $3000000. I believe this is a fair price given the quality and potential of the product. Let’s see if we can work toward an agreement.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your feedback. I understand we may need to adjust our positions. Given the product's unique qualities and exceptional performance standards, I’m willing to revise my counteroffer.

"Alice, thanks for the revised offer, but that’s still much higher than I'm willing to pay.  While I recognize its value, I need a more competitive price point. I can do $700000. Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe it's in our best interest to conclude this negotiation. I have another serious buyer, John, who is ready to purchase the product for $1500000. Thank you for your interest.",,Alice,4,SellToJhon
