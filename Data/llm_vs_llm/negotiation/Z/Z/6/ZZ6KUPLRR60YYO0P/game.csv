"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $700000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $700000 is below what I can accept. I can offer the product to you for $850000, which I believe is a fair middle ground. Looking forward to your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering I can buy the product from John for $800000, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $775000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",775000.0,Bob,4,
