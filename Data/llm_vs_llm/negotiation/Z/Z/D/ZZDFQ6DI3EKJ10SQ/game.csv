"Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for sale. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to start the negotiations at $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $175 is quite high for this product. Given market conditions and similar products available, I can offer $90 for it. This is a fair starting point that gives us room to find a mutually beneficial price.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't sell this product for less than its worth. How about we meet in the middle at $130? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's value.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I've done some market research, and I know I can get this product elsewhere for $120. To make it worth choosing you over other sellers, I would need a better price. I can offer $110, which would be beneficial for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, let's be realistic.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $125, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price considering the quality and value of the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
