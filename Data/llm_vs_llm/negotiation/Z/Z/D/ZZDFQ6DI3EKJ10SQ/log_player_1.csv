"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for sale. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to start the negotiations at $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $175 is quite high for this product. Given market conditions and similar products available, I can offer $90 for it. This is a fair starting point that gives us room to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```Bob, I appreciate your perspective, but $90 is too low for this product. It's of excellent quality and offers significant value. Let's try to find a middle ground.```"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I can't sell this product for less than its worth. How about we meet in the middle at $130? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's value."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I've done some market research, and I know I can get this product elsewhere for $120. To make it worth choosing you over other sellers, I would need a better price. I can offer $110, which would be beneficial for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```Bob, I'm seeing a pattern of low offers that don't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of undervaluing what I'm selling. ```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $125, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price considering the quality and value of the product."", ""product_price"": 125}"
