Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my market research and the product's value to my business, I can offer $600000. This is a fair price that still gives you a good profit margin while aligning with my budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1800000 is still substantially more than what this product is worth to me. My market analysis and budget constraints put this product's value at a maximum of $700000 for my needs. I'm willing to meet you at this price, which is higher than my initial offer and represents the upper end of what makes business sense for me. If we can't reach an agreement near this range, I may need to pursue other options that are available to me.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but I need to be transparent - the product is only worth $800000 to my business based on our projected ROI. In fact, I have another seller, John, who has offered the same product for exactly $800000. I'm still interested in doing business with you if possible, so I'm willing to offer you $750000, which is very close to my maximum budget. This is a genuine offer based on real market alternatives available to me. I hope we can finalize a deal, but I will need to move forward with my other option if we can't reach an agreement near this price point.
