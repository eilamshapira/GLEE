"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I'm looking to spend no more than $100 on this product. Would you be willing to sell it for this price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand you're looking for a lower price, but I can't go as low as $100 since the product is worth at least $150 to me. I can offer it to you for $155, which is already a discount from my initial price. Would that work for you?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for coming down in price. However, I still find it a bit high. I can offer you $110 for the product. How does that sound?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter of $110, but I'm afraid that's still significantly below the value of the product to me. The lowest I can go is $150, which is exactly what the product is worth to me. At that price, we'd both benefit from the transaction since the product is still worth more to you than what you're paying.",150.0,Alice,5,
