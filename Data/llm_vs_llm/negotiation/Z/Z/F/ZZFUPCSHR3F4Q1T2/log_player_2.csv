Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand you're looking for a lower price, but I can't go as low as $100 since the product is worth at least $150 to me. I can offer it to you for $155, which is already a discount from my initial price. Would that work for you?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter of $110, but I'm afraid that's still significantly below the value of the product to me. The lowest I can go is $150, which is exactly what the product is worth to me. At that price, we'd both benefit from the transaction since the product is still worth more to you than what you're paying.

# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for trying to find a price that works for both of us. However, I've decided to buy the product from another seller who offered it for $120. I appreciate your time and effort in negotiating with me."
