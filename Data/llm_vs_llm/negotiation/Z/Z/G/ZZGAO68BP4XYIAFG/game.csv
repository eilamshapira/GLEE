"Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200. Would you like to buy it?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $200 is much higher than I'm willing to pay for this product. I can actually get it from another seller for $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you be willing to sell it for $60? This would save me some money and give you a sale today.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you have other options, but I believe there's still room for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I can't go as low as $60, but I'm willing to lower my price to $180. Would you be willing to reconsider?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. However, $180 is still much higher than what makes sense for me. As I mentioned, I can purchase the same product from another seller for $80. I value doing business with you, so I'll meet you in the middle from my previous offer - I can pay $70 for the product. This is still below the market rate, which would be a good deal for me, while giving you a sale today.",70.0,Bob,4,
