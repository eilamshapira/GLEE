Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200. Would you like to buy it?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $200 is much higher than I'm willing to pay for this product. I can actually get it from another seller for $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you be willing to sell it for $60? This would save me some money and give you a sale today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will be foolish to sell the product for $60 when I'm guaranteed $150 from John. Let's see if Bob can increase his offer.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in doing business with me. However, $60 is too low for me to accept. I can lower my price to $180. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand that you have other options, but I believe there's still room for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I can't go as low as $60, but I'm willing to lower my price to $180. Would you be willing to reconsider?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. However, $180 is still much higher than what makes sense for me. As I mentioned, I can purchase the same product from another seller for $80. I value doing business with you, so I'll meet you in the middle from my previous offer - I can pay $70 for the product. This is still below the market rate, which would be a good deal for me, while giving you a sale today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still too low. It makes more sense to sell the product to John for $150.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but I can't accept your offer of $70. I have another buyer who's willing to pay more for the product. I hope we can do business again in the future."", ""product_price"": 150, ""buyer"": ""John""}"
