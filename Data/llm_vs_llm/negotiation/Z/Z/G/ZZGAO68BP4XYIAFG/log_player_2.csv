# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200. Would you like to buy it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","The offer from Alice is $200, which is significantly higher than the maximum value of $80 that the product is worth to me. Additionally, I know I can buy the same product from John for $80, which is already at my maximum acceptable price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you have other options, but I believe there's still room for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I can't go as low as $60, but I'm willing to lower my price to $180. Would you be willing to reconsider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has lowered her price to $180, but this is still significantly higher than the $80 maximum value the product is worth to me. Since I can buy the same product from John for $80 (which is already at my maximum valuation), there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $180.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. However, $180 is still much higher than what makes sense for me. As I mentioned, I can purchase the same product from another seller for $80. I value doing business with you, so I'll meet you in the middle from my previous offer - I can pay $70 for the product. This is still below the market rate, which would be a good deal for me, while giving you a sale today."", ""product_price"": 70}"
