"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob and I want to earn as much money as I can, I'll start by offering a high price. I know I have a safety net of $1,200,000 from John, so I can be aggressive in my negotiation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($1,200,000) and also lower than what I know he's willing to pay ($1,500,000), I'll reject his offer.

I still have a good chance of getting a better price from Bob, and selling to John for $1,200,000 is not my best option yet, considering Bob's higher willingness to pay.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob rejected my initial offer and then made a low counteroffer of $1,000,000, I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my initial offer, but still keeping in mind that I want to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible.

My counteroffer will be $1,400,000, which is slightly lower than my initial offer but still reflects the high value I believe the product has to Bob.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's new offer of $1,100,000 is still lower than what I'm aiming for, but it's slightly better than his previous offer. However, it's still below the $1,200,000 that John is willing to pay, and I know Bob values the product at $1,500,000.

I'll reject Bob's offer again because I believe I can still get a better price from him. Since we're only at Round 4, I have plenty of room to negotiate further.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still lower than my target, but he's slowly increasing his offer, I'll try to encourage him to meet me closer to the middle.

My next counteroffer will be $1,350,000. This is a decrease from my previous offer of $1,400,000, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still asserts the high value of the product.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's new offer of $1,200,000 matches the price that John is willing to pay. At this point, since Bob's offer is the same as my minimum acceptable price and my alternative option, I don't see a significant advantage in continuing to negotiate with Bob, hoping for a higher price.

Given that Bob's offer is now at the threshold of what I'm willing to accept, and considering the risk that further negotiation might not yield a better result, I'll choose to accept Bob's offer. This ensures I get a price I'm comfortable with without the risk of Bob walking away.
