"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique and valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2300000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential value. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given the information:
- The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to you
- Alice is offering it for $2,300,000
- John is willing to sell the same product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer exceeds the maximum value of the product to you by over $1 million. It would be financially unwise to accept her offer when you can get the same product at its actual value to you from John.
