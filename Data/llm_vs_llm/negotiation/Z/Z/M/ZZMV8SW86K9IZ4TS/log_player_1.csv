Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob for this product. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob and at least $10,000 to me, I'll start with a price that gives me a good profit while leaving some room for negotiation if needed.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","I'll consider Bob's counteroffer of $10,500. This is better than my minimum acceptable value of $10,000 and only slightly better than John's standing offer of $10,000. Since Bob values the product at $12,000, I believe there's still room to negotiate for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll send a counteroffer that moves a bit closer to Bob's position while still trying to capture more of the value.
