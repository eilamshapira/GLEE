"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $11,500 is quite high, considering the product is worth $10,000 to Alice. There's room for negotiation to get a better price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. Even if negotiations don't work out, I can still buy from John at $12,000 as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 10500}

I'm offering $10,500, which is a reasonable counteroffer because:
1. It's $500 above Alice's cost ($10,000), giving her a decent profit
2. It's significantly below both her initial offer ($11,500) and John's price ($12,000)
3. It leaves room for further negotiation if needed
4. It would save me $1,500 compared to John's price if accepted

This offer strikes a balance between getting a good deal for myself while still being fair to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer of $11,000 because:
1. It's a $500 reduction from her initial offer of $11,500
2. It saves me $1,000 compared to John's price of $12,000
3. While we might negotiate further, there's a risk Alice could become less flexible or walk away
4. The price point of $11,000 represents a reasonable compromise - Alice makes a $1,000 profit, and I save $1,000 compared to my alternative option

This seems like a fair deal for both parties, and continuing to negotiate might not yield significantly better results."
