Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I know the product has value, but I can only offer $75 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
