"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $200. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I should reject this offer because $200 is well above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). Since John is willing to sell at $80, there's no reason to accept any price above that.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I won't pay more than $80 (and can get it from John for that price), I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's fair to Alice but still within my constraints.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I know the product has value, but I can only offer $75 for it. Would you consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, after considering your offer, I'm willing to come down from my initial price. I can offer you the product for $180. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $180 is still well above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). Since John is offering the product at $80, and Alice's counteroffers are still far above this price, it makes more sense to buy from John at this point rather than continue negotiating.
