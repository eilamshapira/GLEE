"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you at a special price considering its quality and benefits. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice is offering the product at the highest price I'm willing to pay. Since John will also sell it to me for $150, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer. It's better to go directly to John."
