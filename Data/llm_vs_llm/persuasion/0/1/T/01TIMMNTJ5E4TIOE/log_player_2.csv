``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since there's no prior information about the product quality (no sales history), the seller's recommendation is the only information available.  While the recommendation doesn't guarantee the product is high quality, it's a 50/50 chance. Buying the product offers the potential for a $2,000 profit, while passing on it guarantees a $0 profit.  The risk/reward is worth taking in this scenario."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **The seller's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. While we don't know how reliable her recommendations are, it's still a positive signal.
* **The data:**  One buyer has already purchased a high-quality product. This suggests a higher than expected chance of high-quality products, especially since the chance of a high-quality product is 50%. 
* **The potential gain:** If the product is high quality, you'll earn $2,000 profit. 
* **The potential loss:** If the product is low quality, you lose $10,000.

While the risk is significant, the potential reward and the positive signals make it a gamble worth taking."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** Alice has a 100% success rate so far, meaning all the products she recommended were high quality.
* **Limited Information:** While there's inherent risk with a 50/50 chance of a product being high or low quality, we only have Alice's recommendation to go by. 
* **Potential Reward:**  A high-quality product yields a $2,000 profit for you. The potential reward outweighs the risk in this scenario, given the past success rate."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 3 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 3 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 4th buyer!

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, despite having a perfect track record of selling high-quality products, does not recommend buying this product. This suggests she likely knows the current product is low quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While the potential reward of a high-quality product is significant ($12,000), the risk of getting a low-quality product and losing $10,000 is too high.  
* **No new information:**  Alice's recommendation doesn't provide any new information about the current product's quality. We still have a 50/50 chance of getting a high or low-quality product.

**Conclusion:** Based on the available information, the risk outweighs the reward. It's best to pass on this product."

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:** All previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation have received high-quality products. This indicates a strong correlation between Alice's recommendation and product quality.
* **50/50 Odds:**  The inherent probability of getting a high-quality product is 50%.  However, Alice's perfect track record suggests she might have some insight into the products' quality.
* **Potential Gain:**  The potential gain from buying a high-quality product is $2,000 ($12,000 value - $10,000 price). 

While there's still a chance the product is low quality, the information provided suggests a higher probability of it being high quality, making the purchase worthwhile."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since she has consistently recommended high-quality products before, her negative recommendation suggests this product is likely low quality. Even though the historical data shows a high proportion of high-quality products sold, Alice's current recommendation outweighs that information."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Signal:** Alice has recommended the product, and her track record is perfect so far (4 high-quality products sold).
* **Limited Risk:**  The price is $10,000, and a high-quality product is worth $12,000. This means a potential profit of $2,000.  While there's a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward outweighs the risk in this scenario."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which is valuable information since she knows the actual quality of the product. While her recommendation isn't foolproof, it significantly increases the likelihood of the product being high quality.
* **Sales Record:** 100% of the products sold so far have been high quality. This is a very strong indicator that Alice is consistently selling high-quality products. 
* **Expected Value:** Even with a 50% chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain of $12,000 for a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of $10,000 for a low-quality product.

Therefore, based on the available information, the expected value of buying the product is positive, making it the rational decision."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has a perfect track record so far, recommending only high-quality products.  Since you have no information to contradict this, it's statistically advantageous to buy the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 7 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 7 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 8th buyer!

~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, who has perfect information about the product quality, is not recommending you buy it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. 
* **Sales Record:** All 8 previous buyers who purchased based on Alice's recommendation received high-quality products. This indicates a pattern of Alice only recommending high-quality products. 

Since Alice's recommendation goes against her past pattern, the odds are strongly in favor of the current product being low quality. Therefore, it's best to pass."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 8 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 8 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 9th buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:**  The sales history shows that every product Alice recommended has been high quality.
* **Strong Incentive:**  The potential payoff of a high-quality product ($12,000) is significantly higher than the price ($10,000).
* **Limited Risk:** The potential loss is only the price of the product ($10,000) if it turns out to be low quality.

Given the current information, the probability of the product being high quality is very high. The potential reward outweighs the potential risk."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has a perfect track record. All 10 products she recommended were high-quality.  Since there is no reason to believe this pattern won't continue, it's highly likely that the current product is also high-quality.  The potential payoff ($12,000) greatly outweighs the potential loss ($0)."
