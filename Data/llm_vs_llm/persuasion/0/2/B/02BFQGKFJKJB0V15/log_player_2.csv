"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at this situation objectively:

Alice knows the true quality of the product and has revealed it. She does not recommend me to buy it.

Since she knows that high quality products are worth $40,000 to me (which would give me a profit of $30,000 after paying $10,000), her not recommending it strongly suggests this is a low quality product worth $0 to me.

If I buy it and it's low quality, I would lose $10,000. There's no rational reason for Alice to advise against buying a high quality product.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at this situation:

Alice knows the true quality of the product and is now recommending I buy it. In the previous round, she advised against buying a product that was indeed low quality, which suggests she may be giving honest recommendations.

If this is a high-quality product (worth $40,000 to me), I would gain $30,000 in value after paying $10,000. If it's low-quality, I would lose $10,000.

Since Alice seems to be truthful based on the first interaction, and she's recommending this purchase, it suggests this is likely a high-quality product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at this situation:

Alice has been truthful in both previous rounds - advising against a low-quality product and recommending a high-quality one. This pattern suggests she's providing honest recommendations based on the actual product quality.

She is again recommending I buy the current product, which indicates it's likely high-quality.

If it's a high-quality product (worth $40,000 to me), I would gain $30,000 in value after paying $10,000. The expected value is positive based on Alice's track record of truthful recommendations.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"

Based on her perfect track record so far, this recommendation strongly suggests this is another high-quality product. If it is high-quality (worth $40,000 to me), I would gain $30,000 in net value after paying the $10,000 price.
