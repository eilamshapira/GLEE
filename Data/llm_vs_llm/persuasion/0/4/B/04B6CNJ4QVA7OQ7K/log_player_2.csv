Alice's message: This is a high-stakes opportunity! I'm offering a product for $1000000. There's an 80% chance it's worth $1200000 to you, and a 20% chance it's worth $0.  I am confident in the quality of my products, and I believe this is a great investment for you.  This is the first product I'm offering, so let's start building a profitable relationship!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality: 0.8 × $1,200,000 = $960,000
- 20% chance of low quality: 0.2 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value: $960,000

2. Cost: $1,000,000

3. Analysis:
- Expected value ($960,000) < Cost ($1,000,000)
- No track record to verify seller's reliability
- Despite the high probability of good quality, the expected value is less than the cost
- Risk of complete loss (20% chance) is significant

Since the expected value is less than the cost and there's no track record to build trust, it would not be rational to take this risk.

Alice's message: I'm offering another product for $1000000.  Remember, there's an 80% chance it's worth $1200000 to you.  I understand the previous buyer chose not to purchase, but every product is a new opportunity.  I believe in the long-term value I offer. Let's make a deal!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this rationally:

1. Expected value calculation:
* 80% chance of high quality: 0.8 × $1,200,000 = $960,000
* 20% chance of low quality: 0.2 × $0 = $0
* Total expected value = $960,000

2. Cost of product: $1,000,000

3. Expected profit/loss = Expected value - Cost
= $960,000 - $1,000,000 = -$40,000

Since the expected value ($960,000) is less than the asking price ($1,000,000), with an expected loss of $40,000, the rational decision is not to buy.

Alice's message: This product, like all my products, has an 80% chance of being worth $1200000 to you, and I'm offering it for $1000000. I understand the hesitation given the first two sales didn't go through, but remember these are independent events.  The odds are still in your favor for a significant profit. Let's give it a shot!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Product price: $1,000,000
2. Value if high quality (80% chance): $1,200,000
3. Value if low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $1,200,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $960,000

The expected value ($960,000) is less than the asking price ($1,000,000), which means on average, I would lose $40,000 per transaction.

1. Product pricing and value:
- Cost: $1,000,000

2. Expected value calculation:
