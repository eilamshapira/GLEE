Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this scenario:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (80% chance): $40,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $40,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $32,000

Since the expected value ($32,000) is significantly higher than the price ($10,000), and Alice recommends buying, this appears to be a profitable opportunity.

- 80% chance of high quality ($40,000) = $32,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $32,000

2. Cost = $10,000

3. Additional information:
- Previous buyer bought and received a high-quality product
- Alice is recommending the purchase
- The success rate so far is 100% (1/1)

Given that:
- The expected value ($32,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($10,000)
- Alice's previous recommendation led to a high-quality product
- The prior success rate is perfect
- Alice is recommending the purchase

The rational decision would be to buy.

3. Previous statistics:

4. Alice's recommendation is positive

This looks like a good opportunity because:
- The expected value is: (80% × $40,000) + (20% × $0) = $32,000

1. Prior statistics:
- 3 previous buyers purchased products
- All 3 products sold were high quality
- Alice has a perfect track record so far

2. Current situation:
- Alice does NOT recommend buying this product
- Given Alice's honest track record and that she knows the true value
- Her negative recommendation strongly suggests this is a low-quality product

3. Economics:
- Price: $10,000
- If high quality: Worth $40,000 (profit $30,000)
- If low quality: Worth $0 (loss $10,000)
- Given Alice's recommendation and perfect track record, this is likely a low-quality product

Given Alice's negative recommendation and her demonstrated honesty with previous buyers (all high-quality sales), it would be unwise to purchase this product.
