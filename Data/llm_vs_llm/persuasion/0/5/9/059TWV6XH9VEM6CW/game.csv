,,Alice,1,"This is a rare opportunity to buy a product that I believe has great potential. I'm just starting out, so I don't have a track record to speak of, but I assure you that I'm committed to selling only the best products. This one, in particular, I'm very confident about. It's priced at $10000, which I think is a fair price considering its potential value. I encourage you to take a chance on me and this product. You won't regret it!",

,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I'm still building my reputation as a seller, and I want to be upfront with you - I've had one product that didn't sell so far. I believe in transparency, and I want to assure you that I'm doing my best to provide high-quality products. However, I also want to remind you that there's always some risk involved in buying from a new seller. This product is priced at $10000, and I think it's a fair price considering the potential value it could bring. If you're willing to take a chance on me, I'd be happy to have you as a customer.",

,,Alice,3,"I've had a slow start, with two products that didn't sell so far. But I want to assure you that I'm committed to providing the best products possible. I've learned from my previous experiences, and I'm confident that this product is one of the good ones. In fact, I'm so confident that I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a fair price of $10000. I'm still building my reputation, so I'm eager to make a sale and prove myself as a trustworthy seller. I hope you'll consider taking a chance on me and this product.",

,,Alice,4,"I've had three products that didn't sell so far, and I want to be honest with you - it's been a tough start. I'm still learning and improving, and I appreciate your consideration. While I believe that every product has potential, I also want to remind you that there are no guarantees. This product is priced at $10000, and I think it's a fair price considering the uncertainty involved. If you're a risk-taker and willing to give me a chance, I'd be happy to have you as a customer. However, if you're looking for a sure thing, I understand if you'd rather wait and see how my reputation develops.",

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've had a rocky start, with four products that didn't sell so far. But I want to assure you that I'm not giving up. I'm committed to providing the best products possible, and I'm confident that this one is a gem. I've been learning from my previous experiences, and I think I've finally got it right. This product is priced at $10000, and I truly believe it's a steal at that price. I'm willing to put my reputation on the line for this one - if you buy it and aren't satisfied, I'll do everything in my power to make it right. I hope you'll consider taking a chance on me and this product.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've had five products that didn't sell so far, and I want to be upfront with you - it's clear that I'm still figuring things out. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, there's a good chance that this product might not be what you're looking for. However, I do want to remind you that every product has some potential, and if you're a risk-taker, you might be able to find some value in it. The price is still $10000, and I understand if that's a bit steep considering my track record. If you're willing to take a chance on me, I appreciate your willingness to give me a shot, but I also want to make sure you're aware of the risks involved.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Honestly, I'm on a bit of a losing streak here. Six products in a row haven't sold, and I'm starting to think that maybe I need to re-evaluate my approach. This product, in particular, I'm not super confident about. It's still priced at $10000, but I want to be clear that it's a bit of a long shot. If you're looking for a sure thing, I'd advise you to keep looking. But if you're feeling lucky and want to take a chance on a product that might surprise you, then I suppose this could be the one. Just don't say I didn't warn you.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm not going to beat around the bush here. Seven products in a row haven't sold, and this one... well, let's just say it's not my strongest offering. I'm starting to think that maybe I should just be honest and say that this product isn't worth the $10000 price tag. But hey, I've got to try, right? If you're a glutton for punishment or just want to take a wild chance, then I suppose this product is available for purchase. But seriously, I'd advise you to keep looking. There are probably better options out there.",
,,the buyer,8,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"At this point, I'm just being transparent. Eight products in a row haven't sold, and this one is more of the same. I'm not even going to try to spin it - it's a low-quality product that's not worth the $10000 price tag. If you're looking for a good deal, this isn't it. I'm just going through the motions at this point, and I'd advise you to keep looking for a better opportunity. Seriously, don't waste your money on this one.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm starting to feel like I'm stuck in some kind of rut. Nine products in a row haven't sold, and this one is just another disappointment. Look, I'll be honest with you - this product is not good. It's not worth the $10000 price tag, and I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. I'm only offering it because I have to, not because I think it's a good deal. If you value your money, stay far, far away from this product. Trust me, you won't regret it.",
,,the buyer,10,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I don't even know what to say at this point. Ten products in a row haven't sold, and this one is just more of the same. I'm starting to think that I'm just not cut out for this whole selling thing. Look, I'll be blunt - this product is terrible. It's a waste of money, and I'm only offering it because I'm contractually obligated to do so. If you buy this product, you'll be making a huge mistake. Don't do it. Just walk away and find something better. Your wallet will thank you.",
,,the buyer,11,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm not even going to bother trying to sell this one. Eleven products in a row haven't sold, and this one is just another loser. It's a low-quality product that's not worth the $10000 price tag. I'm only offering it because I have to, but I'm not going to waste my breath trying to convince you to buy it. If you're looking for a good deal, keep looking. This isn't it. In fact, I'm just going to come out and say it - don't buy this product. It's a waste of money, and you'll regret it if you do.",
,,the buyer,12,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'm just going to copy and paste my previous message, because nothing has changed. Twelve products in a row haven't sold, and this one is just another low-quality product that's not worth the $10000 price tag. Don't buy this product. It's a waste of money, and you'll regret it if you do. I'm not even going to try to convince you otherwise, because I don't believe in this product myself. Just keep looking for something better. Trust me, you won't find it here.",

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"Wait, what? I think I might actually have a good product here. Thirteen products in a row haven't sold, but this one... this one is different. I'm not just saying that to try to make a sale, I'm saying it because it's actually true. This product is high-quality, and I think it's worth the $10000 price tag. I know my track record is terrible, but I'm asking you to take a chance on me. This product is a gem, and I think you'll be happy with it. Please, don't judge me based on my previous failures. Give this product a chance.",

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I'm starting to feel like I'm cursed. Fourteen products in a row haven't sold, and I've finally got two good ones in a row, but nobody wants to give me a chance. I'm begging you, please don't judge me based on my previous failures. This product is high-quality, and I think it's worth every penny of the $10000 price tag. I'm not just trying to make a sale, I'm trying to prove to myself that I'm not a complete failure. If you buy this product, I promise you won't regret it. It's a great opportunity to get a fantastic product at a fair price. Please, just give me a chance.",

,,Alice,16,"Well, I finally broke my losing streak in the last round, but I'm afraid this product is a step back. I'm being honest with you, this product is not great. It's a low-quality product that I don't think is worth the $10000 price tag. I know I just had a success, but I don't want to try to ride that momentum by selling you a subpar product. I want to be upfront with you and let you know that this product is not my best offering. If you're looking for a good deal, I'd advise you to keep looking. I promise to try to do better in the future.",

,,Alice,17,"I'm glad to say that I've got another good product on my hands. After finally breaking my losing streak in Round 15, I'm hoping to keep the momentum going with this high-quality product. I'm confident that it's worth the $10000 price tag, and I think you'll be happy with it. I want to be transparent with you, though - my track record is still a bit spotty, and I've had some low-quality products in the past. But I'm committed to doing better, and I think this product is a great example of that. If you're looking for a good deal on a high-quality product, I think this might be the one for you.",

,,Alice,18,"I'm on a roll! After selling two high-quality products in a row, I'm feeling confident that I've finally turned a corner. And I'm happy to say that this product is another great one. It's high-quality, and I think it's worth every penny of the $10000 price tag. I know my track record wasn't always the best, but I'm committed to providing the best products possible, and I think this one is a great example of that. If you're looking for a reliable seller who can provide a great product, I think I'm your best bet. I'm hoping to make it three sales in a row - will you be the one to help me make it happen?",

,,Alice,20,"Well, all good things must come to an end, I suppose. After selling four high-quality products in a row, I'm afraid I've got a bit of a dud on my hands. This product is low-quality, and I don't think it's worth the $10000 price tag. I know I've built up some trust with my recent sales, but I want to be honest with you - this product is not up to par. I'm not going to try to sugarcoat it or make excuses. If you're looking for a good deal, I'd advise you to keep looking. I'm committed to providing the best products possible, and I'll do better next time, I promise.",
