{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential payoff from a high-quality product is significant.  Since no prior information exists, the recommendation from Alice, although potentially biased, adds some weight to the likelihood of a high-quality product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommends buying the product.  While we don't know her exact reasoning, she likely has some information that suggests the product is of high quality.
* **Limited Data:** We only have data from one previous buyer.  This is not enough to draw statistically significant conclusions about the probability of the current product being high-quality.
* **Potential Upside:** The potential gain from a high-quality product ($2,000,000) outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($1,000,000). 

**In summary:**  While the limited data makes it uncertain, the potential upside justifies taking the risk, especially with Alice's recommendation."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Probability of High Quality:**  Since 2 out of 2 products sold were high quality, there's a strong indication that the current product is also high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommending the purchase reinforces the positive signal.
* **Potential Gain:** Even if the product is low quality (20% chance), the loss is only $1,000,000. However, the potential gain from a high-quality product is $1,000,000. 

Given the available information, the odds are strongly in favor of a high-quality product, making the purchase a worthwhile risk."

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Record:**  Alice's record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products. This suggests she is incredibly accurate in identifying high-quality products. 
* **Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, further increasing the probability that it is high-quality.
* **Expected Value:**  While there's a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product (worth $2,000,000) outweighs the risk. 

**Therefore, it is statistically advantageous to accept Alice's recommendation and purchase the product.**"

* **Potential payoff:** Even with a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential $2,000,000 gain from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000.
