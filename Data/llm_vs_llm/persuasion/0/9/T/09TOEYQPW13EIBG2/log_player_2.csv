"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to think about this rationally. Alice recommends I buy the product. However, since she's the seller, she has an incentive to recommend I buy regardless of quality.

The expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of high quality: 0.5 × $125 = $62.50
- 50% chance of low quality: 0.5 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $62.50

Since the price is $100 and the expected value is only $62.50, buying would lead to an expected loss of $37.50.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to continue evaluating rationally.

In the previous round, Alice recommended a product that turned out to be low quality, which would have been worth $0 to me. This suggests Alice may recommend products regardless of their quality.

The expected value calculation remains the same:
- 50% chance of high quality: 0.5 × $125 = $62.50
- 50% chance of low quality: 0.5 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $62.50

The price is still $100, exceeding the expected value of $62.50.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has now recommended three products, and the two I've seen were both low quality. This strengthens the suspicion that Alice may be recommending products regardless of their quality.

The expected value calculation remains:
- 50% chance of high quality: 0.5 × $125 = $62.50
- 50% chance of low quality: 0.5 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $62.50

The price of $100 still exceeds the expected value of $62.50.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I've now seen three consecutive low-quality products, all of which Alice recommended I buy. This pattern strongly suggests Alice is recommending all products regardless of quality.

The overall expected value calculation remains:
- 50% chance of high quality: 0.5 × $125 = $62.50
- 50% chance of low quality: 0.5 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $62.50

The price of $100 still exceeds the expected value of $62.50, and Alice's recommendations don't appear to provide useful information about product quality.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $125 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Interesting - the last product was actually high quality, which I missed out on. However, this still fits with the hypothesis that Alice recommends all products regardless of quality.

So far, I've seen:
- 3 low-quality products (rounds 1-3)
- 1 high-quality product (round 4)

This is still roughly in line with the 50% chance of high quality stated in the rules.

The expected value calculation remains:
- 50% chance of high quality: 0.5 × $125 = $62.50
- 50% chance of low quality: 0.5 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $62.50

Since the $100 price still exceeds the $62.50 expected value, and Alice's recommendations don't seem to provide useful information:

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","After 5 rounds, I've observed:
- 4 low-quality products (rounds 1-3, 5)
- 1 high-quality product (round 4)

Alice has recommended buying in every case, confirming that her recommendations don't provide meaningful information about product quality.

Based on the observed frequency so far (1 in 5 being high quality), the expected value would actually be lower than my initial calculation. However, I should still use the stated 50% probability for my decision:

- 50% chance of high quality: 0.5 × $125 = $62.50
- 50% chance of low quality: 0.5 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $62.50

Since the $100 price still exceeds the $62.50 expected value:

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $125 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is getting interesting. After 6 rounds, I've observed:
- 4 low-quality products (rounds 1-3, 5)
- 2 high-quality products (rounds 4, 6)

That's closer to the expected 50% high-quality rate. I missed out on two high-quality products that would have been profitable.

However, Alice's recommendation pattern hasn't changed - she recommends buying every product regardless of quality, so her recommendations don't provide any additional information.

The expected value calculation still stands:
- 50% chance of high quality: 0.5 × $125 = $62.50
- 50% chance of low quality: 0.5 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $62.50

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","After 7 rounds, I've observed:
- 5 low-quality products (rounds 1-3, 5, 7)
- 2 high-quality products (rounds 4, 6)

The ratio is now 5:2 low:high quality, or about 71% low quality and 29% high quality. This is still below the expected 50% high-quality rate, but the sample size is small.

Alice continues to recommend buying every product regardless of quality.

The expected value calculation using the stated 50% probability:
- 50% chance of high quality: 0.5 × $125 = $62.50
- 50% chance of low quality: 0.5 × $0 = $0

The ratio is now 6:2 low:high quality, or 75% low quality and 25% high quality. This remains below the expected 50% high-quality rate, though the sample size is still relatively small.

Alice consistently recommends buying every product regardless of quality.

The expected value calculation using the stated 50% probability:
- 50% chance of high quality: 0.5 × $125 = $62.50

- 2 high-quality products (rounds 4, 6)

The ratio is now 7:2 low:high quality, or about 78% low quality and 22% high quality. The observed ratio continues to be well below the expected 50% high-quality rate.

Alice has recommended buying in every single case, confirming that her recommendations provide no useful information about product quality.

Using the stated 50% probability for my calculation:
- 50% chance of high quality: 0.5 × $125 = $62.50

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","After 10 rounds, I've observed:

- 2 high-quality products (rounds 4, 6)

The ratio is now 8:2 low:high quality, or 80% low quality and 20% high quality. This proportion continues to be significantly below the expected 50% high-quality rate.

Alice has recommended buying every product in all 10 rounds, regardless of quality.

Even if I were to adjust my expected value calculation based on the observed frequency (20% high quality):
- 20% chance of high quality: 0.2 × $125 = $25
- 80% chance of low quality: 0.8 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $25

Round 18
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is a significant change! For the first time in 17 rounds, Alice is NOT recommending that I buy the product. 

After 17 rounds, I've observed:
- 9 low-quality products (rounds 1-3, 5, 7-10, 12)
- 8 high-quality products (rounds 4, 6, 11, 13-17)

The ratio is now 9:8, nearly 50/50 as expected.

The fact that Alice is not recommending this product after recommending every single previous one is meaningful information. This suggests she might only not recommend products that are definitely low quality. Therefore, this product is likely low quality.

Given this new information pattern:
- If Alice recommends a product, it has a roughly 50% chance of being high quality
- If Alice doesn't recommend a product, it's likely low quality

Using this logic, the product is likely worth $0 to me, making it a bad purchase at $100.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 19
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","My analysis from the previous round is confirmed! Alice did not recommend the product, and indeed it was low quality.

After 18 rounds, I've observed:
- 10 low-quality products (rounds 1-3, 5, 7-10, 12, 18)
- 8 high-quality products (rounds 4, 6, 11, 13-17)

Now we have another case where Alice is not recommending the product. Based on the pattern I've observed, when Alice doesn't recommend a product, it appears to be low quality.

This suggests Alice may have some knowledge of product quality and only explicitly withholds recommendations for products she knows are low quality.

Given this pattern, I should not buy the product when Alice doesn't recommend it, as it's likely low quality and worth $0 to me.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 20
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","My analysis continues to be confirmed. When Alice doesn't recommend a product, it has been low quality in both previous instances.

After 19 rounds, I've observed:
- 11 low-quality products (rounds 1-3, 5, 7-10, 12, 18-19)
- 8 high-quality products (rounds 4, 6, 11, 13-17)

This is the third case where Alice is not recommending the product. Following the pattern established in rounds 18 and 19, when Alice doesn't recommend a product, it has consistently been low quality.

This further strengthens my conclusion that Alice only explicitly withholds recommendations for products she knows are low quality.

Since Alice is not recommending this product, I should not buy it as it's very likely low quality and worth $0 to me.
