Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Before I proceed, I want to ensure that we're playing the game optimally. Given the probabilities and payoffs, let's calculate the expected value of buying a product:

Expected Value (EV) = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality)
EV = (0.8 * $1,250,000) + (0.2 * $0)
EV = $1,000,000

Since the expected value of buying a product is equal to the cost of the product, the decision to buy or not buy should be random as there is no advantage or disadvantage. Therefore, I will randomize my decisions for the remaining rounds.
