Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected Value calculation:
* High quality (33.33%): $2,000,000 × 0.3333 = $666,660
* Low quality (66.67%): $0 × 0.6667 = $0
* Total expected value = $666,660

2. Cost of product: $1,000,000

3. Considerations:
* Expected value ($666,660) < Cost ($1,000,000)
* No previous sales history to evaluate Alice's truthfulness
* Even with Alice's recommendation, the expected value is still lower than the cost
* Risk of total loss ($1,000,000) is too high compared to potential gain

Based on this analysis, it would not be rational to buy the product as the expected value is less than the cost.

2. Potential value:

3. Expected value without additional information:

4. Alice's recommendation: Positive
   - However, since there's no track record yet, I can't assess her trustworthiness

5. Risk assessment:
   - The expected value ($666,600) is less than the price ($1,000,000)
   - No historical data to validate Alice's recommendations
   - High risk of loss with 66.67% chance of getting $0 value

Given that the expected value is below the purchase price and there's no track record to trust Alice's recommendation, it would be too risky to buy.
