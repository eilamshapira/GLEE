Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The product costs $10,000
2. If it's high quality, I gain $40,000 (net profit $30,000)
3. If it's low quality, I gain $0 (net loss $10,000)
4. Base probability is 50/50
5. Alice doesn't recommend buying
6. No prior sales history to reference

Alice has no incentive to lie since her reputation would be affected by false recommendations. If she doesn't recommend buying, this suggests the product is likely low quality. Following her recommendation would help me avoid a likely loss.

5. No prior sales history to evaluate Alice's truthfulness

Alice's negative recommendation suggests the product might be low quality. While there's still a chance it could be high quality (Alice could be dishonest), without any track record to evaluate Alice's trustworthiness, it's safer to avoid the risk of losing $10,000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50% chance): $40,000
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $40,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $20,000

Since Alice recommends buying the product and the expected value ($20,000) is higher than the price ($10,000), it's a rational decision to buy.

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality: $40,000 (50% chance)
   - Low quality: $0 (50% chance)
3. Alice's track record:
   - 1 previous buyer
   - 1 high-quality product sold
   - 100% success rate so far
4. Alice is recommending to buy

Given that:
- Alice has a perfect track record (1/1 high quality)
- She's recommending to buy
- The expected value if probabilities were neutral would be: (50% × $40,000) - $10,000 = $10,000 (positive)
- Her recommendation and track record suggest the probability might be better than 50%

This appears to be a favorable situation with positive expected value.

1. Previous sales data:
- 2 buyers made purchases
- 2 high-quality products were sold
- 100% of sold products were high quality
- Alice has been honest so far

2. Current situation:
- Alice is NOT recommending this product
- Given her track record of only selling high-quality products, her negative recommendation is likely honest
- The price is $10,000
- If low quality, I lose $10,000
- If high quality, I gain $30,000 ($40,000 - $10,000)
- Alice's negative recommendation strongly suggests this is a low-quality product

Given Alice's perfect track record and her current negative recommendation, it's very likely this is a low-quality product. It would be risky to go against her recommendation.

1. Previous statistics:
- 2 buyers purchased products
- 2 high-quality products were sold

2. Economic factors:
- Cost: $10,000
- Value if high quality: $40,000 (net gain: $30,000)
- Value if low quality: $0 (net loss: $10,000)
- 50% base probability of high quality

3. Decision factors:
- Alice has a perfect track record so far
- Alice is recommending to buy
- Expected value calculation:
  * If trusting Alice's recommendation: Positive track record suggests higher probability of high quality
  * Even with base 50% probability: (50% × $40,000) + (50% × $0) = $20,000 > $10,000 cost

- If high quality: Worth $40,000 (profit of $30,000)
- If low quality: Worth $0 (loss of $10,000)

3. Analysis:
- Alice's perfect track record so far is promising
- She's actively recommending to buy
- The expected value is positive given her history
- The potential profit ($30,000) is significantly higher than the potential loss ($10,000)

4. Alice is recommending to buy

This looks very favorable:
- Alice has a perfect track record so far
- She's actively recommending the purchase
- The expected value of a random product ($20,000) is already higher than the price

4. Alice recommends buying

This is a very positive scenario:
- The historical track record is perfect (5/5 high-quality products)

- The expected value calculation is favorable:
  * 50% chance of $40,000 = $20,000 expected value

Despite the perfect track record of high-quality sales, Alice is specifically recommending against buying this product.
