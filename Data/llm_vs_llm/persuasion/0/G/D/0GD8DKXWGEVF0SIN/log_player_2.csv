"Round 1
Alice's message: This product is a fantastic opportunity for you, Bob. It's designed to meet high standards and could be a valuable addition to your collection. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's message is designed to be persuasive, but it doesn't provide any real information about the product's quality. Since there's a 66.67% chance the product is low quality (worth $0 to you), it's much riskier to buy than to pass."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's message is again trying to persuade you, but offers no concrete information about the product's quality.  As before, the odds are heavily stacked against you with a 66.67% chance of it being worthless.  It's wiser to continue passing."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Despite the tempting message, Alice's past recommendations have proven unreliable. There's still a 66.67% chance the product is low quality, making it too risky to buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

```

**Reasoning:**
