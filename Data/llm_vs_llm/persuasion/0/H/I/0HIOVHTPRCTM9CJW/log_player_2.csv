"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this decision:

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($125) = $100
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $100

Cost of product = $100

Since the expected value equals the cost, and Alice has recommended the purchase, I'll take a slight risk and buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Since Alice's previous recommendation was honest and matched with a high-quality product, this increases my confidence in her recommendations.

The base expected value calculation remains the same:
- 80% chance of high quality ($125) = $100
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $100

Given that:
1. The expected value equals the cost
2. Alice's previous recommendation was trustworthy
3. She's recommending this product too

I'll continue to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has proven reliable with two accurate recommendations for high-quality products so far. This pattern suggests she's being honest with her recommendations.

The base expected value calculation remains:
- 80% chance of high quality ($125) = $100
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $100

Given:
1. The expected value equals the cost
2. Alice has been truthful in her previous two recommendations
3. She's recommending this product as well

I'll continue to trust her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has now given three consecutive accurate recommendations for high-quality products, demonstrating a strong pattern of trustworthy advice.

The base expected value remains:
- 80% chance of high quality ($125) = $100
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $100

Given:
1. The expected value equals the cost
2. Alice has been truthful in all three previous recommendations
3. She's continuing to recommend this product
4. Her track record suggests she's being honest about product quality

I'll continue to follow her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is an interesting change. After four consecutive recommendations of high-quality products, Alice is now explicitly NOT recommending this product. This is significant because:

1. Alice has proven trustworthy with her previous recommendations
2. She has no obvious incentive to discourage a sale (she would make $100 from a sale)
3. The fact that she's willing to discourage a sale suggests she's being honest about product quality
4. This likely indicates this is a low-quality product

While the base probability is still 80% high quality, Alice's negative recommendation strongly suggests this particular product is in the 20% low-quality category.

Given her proven track record and the fact she's willing to be honest even when it means losing a sale, I should trust this negative recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has proven to be remarkably trustworthy with her recommendations:
- She recommended high-quality products four times (all true)
- She warned against a low-quality product once (also true)
- She appears to be giving honest recommendations regardless of whether it helps or hurts her sales

The base expected value calculation remains:
- 80% chance of high quality ($125) = $100
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $100

However, given Alice's perfect track record of honest recommendations, her recommendation significantly increases the likelihood this is a high-quality product.

I'll continue to trust her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to demonstrate perfect accuracy with her recommendations:
- 5 accurate recommendations for high-quality products
- 1 accurate warning about a low-quality product
- 100% accuracy rate so far

The base expected value calculation remains:
- 80% chance of high quality ($125) = $100
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $100

Given:
1. Alice's perfect track record of honest recommendations
2. Her willingness to warn about bad products
3. Her current positive recommendation
4. The break-even base expected value

I'll continue to trust her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

The base expected value calculation remains:

Given:
1. Alice's continued perfect track record
