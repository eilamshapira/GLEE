"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Alice does not recommend me to buy the product. This suggests she might have information that it's low quality. Since she's the seller, it's interesting that she would not recommend her own product.

Given that:
- If it's high quality, my value is $12,500 (profit of $2,500)
- If it's low quality, my value is $0 (loss of $10,000)
- The prior probability is 50% for each quality level
- Alice is not recommending the purchase

Alice's recommendation against buying suggests this is more likely to be a low-quality product. Following her recommendation would help me avoid a potential $10,000 loss, while only missing out on a potential $2,500 gain.
