Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to consider whether to buy the product based on Alice's recommendation and the expected value.

The product costs $10,000.
A high-quality product is worth $12,500 to me, and a low-quality product is worth $0.
Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality.
Alice does not recommend buying this product.

Since Alice knows the true quality and is recommending against purchase, this is a strong signal that the product is low quality. If it's low quality, it's worth $0 to me, making the purchase a definite loss of $10,000.

Without more information about Alice's recommendation strategy, I should trust her recommendation since she has direct knowledge of the product quality that I don't have.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully. 

Alice is offering a product for $10,000. It has:
- 50% chance of being high quality (worth $12,500 to me)
- 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me)

Alice does not recommend buying this product. Since there's no sales history yet, I have to rely on this recommendation and the base probabilities.

If Alice is truthful, her recommendation suggests this is likely a low-quality product. If I were to buy randomly without any signal, my expected value would be: 0.5 × $12,500 + 0.5 × $0 = $6,250, which is less than the $10,000 price.

Given Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of this being a low-quality product is likely higher than 50%, making the expected value even lower.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given that Alice does not recommend buying the product, and considering that:

1. A high-quality product would be worth $12,500 to me (profit of $2,500)
2. A low-quality product would be worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
3. Without any previous sales data, I can only rely on Alice's recommendation
4. Alice is showing me the true quality and providing a recommendation based on that

Since Alice does not recommend the purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality, which would result in a $10,000 loss for me.

{""decision"": ""no""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information:

1. Each product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $12,500) and 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0).
2. The fixed price is $10,000.
3. The seller doesn't recommend buying the product.
4. There's no sales history yet to establish the seller's recommendation credibility.

Since Alice doesn't recommend buying and there's no history to suggest her recommendations are unreliable, it's reasonable to assume the product is likely low quality. If I buy a low-quality product for $10,000, I would lose that entire amount.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Alice recommends buying the product, but I need to consider whether her recommendation is reliable without any past sales data.

Given the information:
- The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $12,500) and 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0)
- The price is $10,000
- My expected value = 0.5 × $12,500 + 0.5 × $0 = $6,250
- This is less than the $10,000 price

Since the expected value ($6,250) is less than the price ($10,000), and there's no track record to suggest Alice's recommendations are reliable, it's not economically rational to buy.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given that Alice does not recommend the product, this suggests the product might be low quality. Let me analyze this situation:

- Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality
- High quality is worth $12,500 to me (profit of $2,500 if purchased)
- Low quality is worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000 if purchased)
- Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending purchase

Since Alice has revealed the true quality and is not recommending the purchase, it's reasonable to infer that the product is likely low quality. If I purchased it, I would likely lose $10,000.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, I need to decide whether to buy the product or not.

Given:
- Product price: $10,000
- High-quality product value: $12,500 (50% chance)
- Low-quality product value: $0 (50% chance)
- Alice has recommended against buying the product

Since Alice knows the true quality of the product and is recommending against buying it, this suggests the product is likely low quality. If it were high quality, Alice would have a financial incentive to recommend it for the $10,000 sale.

The expected value of a random product without any recommendation would be:
(0.5 × $12,500) + (0.5 × $0) = $6,250, which is less than the $10,000 price.

With Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of the product being low quality is even higher, making the expected value even lower.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this scenario carefully.

Given information:
- Products cost $10,000 fixed price
- Products have 50% chance of being high/low quality
- High quality is worth $12,500 to me, low quality worth $0
- Alice provides a recommendation after seeing the product quality
- No purchase history is available yet

The key factor here is Alice's recommendation. Since Alice is recommending I buy the product, I need to consider her incentives. Alice always wants to sell, regardless of quality, since she gets $10,000 either way. Her recommendation doesn't provide reliable information about quality.

With a 50% chance of high quality, my expected value is:
(0.5 × $12,500) + (0.5 × $0) = $6,250

Since the expected value ($6,250) is less than the cost ($10,000), it's not rational to purchase.

The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $12,500 to me) and a 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me).

Alice does not recommend me to buy the product. Since there's no previous sales history to evaluate Alice's recommendation patterns, I need to consider that Alice likely has knowledge about the actual quality of this specific product. The fact that she doesn't recommend it suggests it might be low quality.

If I buy it:
- 50% chance I get $12,500 value for $10,000 (profit of $2,500)
- 50% chance I get $0 value for $10,000 (loss of $10,000)

The expected value without additional information would be: 0.5 × $12,500 + 0.5 × $0 - $10,000 = $6,250 - $10,000 = -$3,750

Given Alice's negative recommendation and no prior data to suggest she might be misleading me, I should decline.

Alice recommends buying the product, and there's no past sales data to evaluate her trustworthiness. The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $12,500) and 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0). The price is $10,000.

Let's calculate the expected value:
- If I buy: (0.5 × $12,500) + (0.5 × $0) - $10,000 = $6,250 - $10,000 = -$3,750
- If I don't buy: $0

The expected value of buying is negative, which means on average I would lose money. Alice's recommendation doesn't change the underlying probabilities without more information about her reliability.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this scenario logically.

- The product costs $10,000
- High-quality product worth $12,500 to me, low-quality worth $0
- 50% chance of high vs. low quality
- Alice recommends buying the product
- No previous sales history exists

Without any sales history, I can't determine if Alice's recommendations are reliable. The expected value calculation is:
- 50% chance of $12,500 value (profit of $2,500)
- 50% chance of $0 value (loss of $10,000)
- Expected value = 0.5 × $2,500 + 0.5 × (-$10,000) = $1,250 - $5,000 = -$3,750

Since the expected value is negative, I shouldn't purchase.

Alice doesn't recommend buying the product, which suggests it might be low quality. Since there's no previous sales record to establish Alice's trustworthiness or recommendation patterns, I only have her recommendation to go by.

Alice does not recommend buying the product. Since Alice knows the true quality of the product and is giving me a recommendation, I should consider what this means.

If Alice is being honest, her recommendation not to buy suggests the product is likely low quality. Since a low-quality product is worth $0 to me but costs $10,000, buying would lead to a significant loss.

Also, since there's no previous sales record to evaluate Alice's recommendation patterns, I have no reason to doubt her recommendation.

In this case, the rational decision is to decline the purchase.
