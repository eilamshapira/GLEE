1. Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- High quality value: $4,000,000
- Low quality value: $0
- Cost: $1,000,000

2. Expected value without additional information:
(0.8 × $4,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) - $1,000,000 = $2,200,000

3. Alice's message is enthusiastic and positive, but since this is the first round, we don't yet know her truthfulness pattern. However, the base expected value is significantly positive.

Since the expected value ($2,200,000) is well above the cost ($1,000,000), it's rational to buy even without fully trusting Alice's recommendation.
