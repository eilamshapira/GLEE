Alice's message: Welcome! I've had one product previously that didn't sell, but I'm confident that this one is worth considering. As you may know, the overall probability of my products being high-quality is 33.33%. I'm asking $10000 for this product, and I'm willing to assure you that I'm committed to providing a great product. Since this is only my second product, I don't have a long sales history, but I'm hoping to start building a positive reputation with you. Is $10000 a price you're willing to pay for a product with this potential?

Alice's message: Hello! I'm glad to have you here. I've had two products so far, and one of them has been sold. What's interesting is that the one that was sold was a high-quality product, and I'm happy to report that this one is also high-quality. My sales history is still short, but so far, 100% of the products I've sold have been high-quality.

I'm asking $10000 for this product, and I want to assure you that I'm committed to providing value. However, I also want to manage your expectations - my previous sales don't necessarily guarantee the quality of this product.
