{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is the only information we have. Since she knows the true quality of the product and doesn't recommend buying it, it's a strong indicator that the product is low quality. Even with a 50/50 chance, it's not worth the risk of potentially losing $10,000."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation against buying the product is a strong signal. Since there's no historical data, we rely entirely on Alice's knowledge of the product's quality.  Even though there's a 50% chance of it being high quality, the risk of it being low quality and worthless is too high.  It's better to pass and wait for more information."
"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!
~

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since there is no information on the quality of previous products and Alice recommends buying, it's reasonable to assume she is offering a high-quality product.  Even if the product turns out to be low-quality (50% chance), it's still a gamble worth taking. The potential gain of $2,500 (high-quality product) outweighs the potential loss of $10,000 (low-quality product) in this case."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong indicator. Since she knows the true quality of the product and is not recommending it, it's highly likely the product is low quality. Even though the previous buyer purchased a high-quality product, the sample size is too small to make a reliable judgment. It's better to pass and avoid the risk of buying a worthless product."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice, knowing the true value of the product, does not recommend buying it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. Since the previous buyer purchased a high-quality product, it further reinforces the likelihood of the current product being low quality. It's not worth the risk of spending $10,000 for a product likely worth $0."

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which means she has likely presented you with a high-quality product.  
* **Previous Sales:** The previous buyer purchased a high-quality product. This further reinforces the idea that Alice is likely offering a high-quality product to you. 
* **Value Calculation:**  Even if there's a 50% chance it's low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($12,500) outweighs the potential loss ($0).

Therefore, based on the information available, it's a good gamble to buy the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since she knows the true value of the product and has a strong incentive to sell, her recommendation not to buy suggests the product is likely low quality. Even though the historical data suggests a 100% success rate for high-quality products, Alice's recommendation outweighs this small sample size."

~

{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who knows the product's true quality, is not recommending the product. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. 
* **Previous Sales:**  The fact that two high-quality products were sold previously is a bit misleading. Since Alice can choose which products to offer, this doesn't necessarily mean the next product will be high quality. 

While there's always a chance the product is high quality, the odds are against you based on the available information. It's wiser to pass."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since she knows the true quality of each product, her recommendation against buying suggests that this particular product is likely low quality.  Even though the historical data shows a high proportion of high-quality products sold, this single recommendation is very strong evidence to the contrary."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has a perfect track record of recommending only high-quality products. Since she recommends buying this product, it is highly likely that it is also high-quality. The potential gain ($12,500) far outweighs the potential loss ($0). Therefore, it is rational to buy the product."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:** Alice has a 100% success rate in recommending high-quality products.
* **Value Proposition:** Even with a 50/50 chance of a product being high or low quality, the potential gain of $12,500 outweighs the potential loss of $10,000. 
* **Trust:** Alice's consistent track record makes her recommendation very credible.

Since the potential reward is significant, and the risk is mitigated by Alice's perfect recommendation history, it is a rational decision to buy the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 6 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 6 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 7th buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The seller's recommendation is a strong signal. Since all six previous buyers who followed the recommendation purchased high-quality products, it's highly likely that the current product is also high quality.  While there's still a chance of getting a low-quality product, the odds are heavily in favor of a good deal at this point."
