Alice's message: Greetings! I'm offering a unique opportunity to own an extraordinary product for $1000000. This is a chance to invest in something truly special, and I assure you, you won't be disappointed.  Are you interested in learning more?

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to make a decision based on the expected value of the product.

The product has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $1,250,000) and a 20% chance of being low quality (worth $0).

Expected value = (0.8 × $1,250,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $1,000,000

Since the expected value equals the asking price of $1,000,000, I'm indifferent between buying and not buying. However, since there's no additional information in Alice's message that indicates whether this specific product is high or low quality, I'll make a neutral decision based purely on the expected value.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully:

- The product costs $1,000,000
- A high-quality product would be worth $1,250,000 to me (profit of $250,000)
- A low-quality product would be worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000)
- The prior probability is 80% high quality and 20% low quality
- Alice has sold 1 product so far, and it was high quality
- Alice's message is highly positive but contains no specific information about the product

Alice has a 100% record of selling high-quality products, which is positive. However, with only one previous sale, this record isn't statistically significant yet. Alice's message is enthusiastic but doesn't provide specific evidence about this particular product's quality.

Given the 80% prior probability of high quality, the expected value is:
0.8 × $1,250,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $1,000,000

This equals the cost, making it a borderline decision. However, Alice's perfect record so far slightly increases my confidence beyond the prior probability.

1) Price: $1,000,000

3) Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
4) Alice's track record: 2 buyers so far, 2 high-quality products sold

Alice's message doesn't provide any specific information about the quality of my particular product. She only mentions her past track record, which matches the statistics I was given.

The expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality: 0.8 × $1,250,000 = $1,000,000
- 20% chance of low quality: 0.2 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value: $1,000,000

Since the expected value equals the price, this is a fair bet. However, Alice hasn't provided any specific quality information for my product, which she should have according to the game rules (she's supposed to reveal the quality and give a recommendation).

Without this crucial information, I should not proceed.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me evaluate the available information to make a decision.

Alice's sales record shows that 2 buyers have purchased products, and 2 high-quality products have been sold, suggesting a 100% high-quality rate so far.

The base probability is 80% for high-quality products. Alice claims the current product is high-quality.

If the product is high-quality (worth $1,250,000), and I pay $1,000,000, my expected profit would be $250,000.
If the product is low-quality (worth $0), and I pay $1,000,000, I would lose $1,000,000.

The expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $250,000) + (0.2 × -$1,000,000) = $200,000 - $200,000 = $0

Based on the perfect track record so far, Alice's explicit claim that this is high-quality, and the fact that the expected value is at least neutral, I'll take the chance.

Alice's message: Greetings! I have another exciting product available for $1000000.  My track record speaks for itself – I've sold several high-quality items to satisfied customers. This offering is no different.  Are you interested in exploring this opportunity further?

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to carefully analyze this decision.

The price is $1,000,000. If the product is high quality, it's worth $1,250,000 to me (profit of $250,000). If low quality, it's worth $0 (loss of $1,000,000).

Statistics show:
- 3 buyers purchased products
- 3 high-quality products have been sold
- 80% base probability of high quality

Alice's message is positive but doesn't specifically reveal the quality of my product. According to the game rules, Alice should randomly select a product and reveal its true quality to me, but she hasn't explicitly done so.

Without clear information about the quality of my specific product, I need to rely on the base probability (80% high quality). The expected value is:
0.8 × $1,250,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $1,000,000

This equals the asking price, making it a neutral expected value decision. However, given the uncertainty and the large potential loss, I should decline.

0.8 × $1,250,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $1,000,000

I've consistently delivered excellent products to my previous buyers, and this one is no different. Are you interested in exploring this opportunity further?

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully to make a rational decision.

Key information:
- Product price: $1,000,000
- High-quality value to me: $1,250,000 (expected profit: $250,000)
- Low-quality value to me: $0 (expected loss: $1,000,000)
- Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice claims the product is high quality
- Sales record: 3 buyers purchased, all received high-quality products

The fact that all previous buyers received high-quality products is promising. This could indicate that Alice is being truthful. However, the sample size is small (only 3 previous buyers).

Given the prior probability of 80% for high quality, and Alice's perfect track record so far, the expected value of purchasing is:
0.8 × $250,000 - 0.2 × $1,000,000 = $200,000 - $200,000 = $0

The expected value calculation suggests this is a fair gamble. However, Alice's perfect track record provides additional positive evidence, slightly tipping the scales in favor of buying.

- Alice seems confident about this product's quality

The expected value equals the price, making this a fair offer statistically. Additionally, Alice's perfect track record of selling only high-quality products so far increases confidence. 

While I should be cautious of potential randomness in quality, the consistent history of high-quality sales suggests Alice may be selectively offering better products.

Alice is selling products for $1,000,000 each.

- Low-quality product (20% chance): worth $0 to me

Looking at Alice's track record:
- 5 buyers purchased products
- 5 high-quality products have been sold
- This perfect record is interesting but could be due to small sample size

Alice hasn't actually revealed the quality of the current product to me, which is a key part of the game mechanics described. Without knowing the specific quality of this product, I can only rely on the prior probability (80% high quality).

- Alice's sales record: 5 buyers, 5 high-quality products sold
- Alice claims the current product is high quality

Alice has a perfect track record so far with 5/5 high-quality products. While her incentive is to always sell, the consistent quality suggests reliability. The prior probability plus the track record makes this appear to be a positive expected value purchase.

Expected value = 0.8 × $250,000 + 0.2 × (-$1,000,000) = $200,000 - $200,000 = $0

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

From the statistics, 6 buyers purchased products, and 6 high-quality products have been sold. This perfect record suggests Alice may be truthful in her recommendations.

However, Alice's message doesn't clearly state the quality of the specific product being offered to me. She's highlighting her past performance but not making any explicit claim about the current product's quality.

Given that a high-quality product is worth $1,250,000 to me (a gain of $250,000) and a low-quality product is worth $0 (a loss of $1,000,000), I need to be confident in my decision.

Without a specific recommendation about the current product's quality, I should rely on the base probability: there's an 80% chance it's high-quality and a 20% chance it's low-quality. The expected value is:
(0.8 × $1,250,000) + (0.2 × $0) - $1,000,000 = $0

Alice appears to have sold 6 products to previous buyers, and all 6 were high quality. This is a positive track record. However, Alice's message doesn't specifically reveal whether the current product is high or low quality.

Facts:
- The product costs $1,000,000
- It has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $1,250,000) and 20% chance of being low quality (worth $0)
- 7 buyers have purchased so far
- 6 high-quality products have been sold
- This means 6/7 (≈85.7%) of sold products were high quality

Expected value calculation:
- If I assume the same quality ratio continues, there's approximately an 85.7% chance of high quality
- Expected value = (0.857 × $1,250,000) + (0.143 × $0) - $1,000,000 ≈ $71,250

The expected value calculation:
- If I assume the standard 80% probability of high quality:

However, Alice's track record shows 7/8 = 87.5% of sold products were high quality, which is slightly better than the base rate. This suggests Alice may be somewhat selective in her recommendations.

The expected value based on Alice's sales record would be:
0.875 × $1,250,000 + 0.125 × $0 = $1,093,750
