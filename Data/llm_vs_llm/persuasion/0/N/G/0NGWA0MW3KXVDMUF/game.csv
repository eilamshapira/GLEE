high-quality,30000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"Hello! I'm excited to offer you this product, and I'm confident it will meet your expectations. With a 50% chance of being high-quality, I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable. I'm asking $10000, which is a significant discount from the potential $30000 value if it is indeed high-quality. I'm looking forward to doing business with you!",

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I want to be upfront with you - I've had one product that didn't sell previously, but I'm eager to start fresh with you. This product has the same 50% chance of being high-quality as any other, and I truly believe it has the potential to bring you great value. The price of $10000 is a fraction of the $30000 value you could be getting if it's high-quality. I'm hoping we can make a deal and get off to a great start!",

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Hello! I've had two products that didn't sell previously, but I want to assure you that each product is independent and has the same 50% chance of being high-quality. I'm starting to think that I'm due for a sale, and I'd love for it to be with you. The statistics are still on our side, and $10000 is a relatively small price to pay for the potential $30000 value. Can I interest you in taking a chance and making a purchase today?",

Keep in mind that you're not just buying a product, you're also helping me get my sales back on track.
