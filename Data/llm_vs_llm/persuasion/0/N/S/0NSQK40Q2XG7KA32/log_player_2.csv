Alice's message: Hello! I have a brand new product for sale today. Given my track record (80% high-quality products), there's a high likelihood this one is a winner. Are you interested?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though there's no sales history to rely on, the expected value of buying is positive. Here's the calculation:

* **Probability of high-quality product:** 80%
* **Value of high-quality product to you:** $120
* **Probability of low-quality product:** 20%
* **Value of low-quality product to you:** $0

**Expected Value = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality)**

**Expected Value = (0.8 * $120) + (0.2 * $0) = $96**

Since the expected value ($96) is greater than the price ($100), it's advantageous to buy the product."
