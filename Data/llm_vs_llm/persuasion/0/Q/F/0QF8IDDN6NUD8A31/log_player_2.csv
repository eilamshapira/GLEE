"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this rationally. 

If I buy the product, I'll pay $10,000. There's an 80% chance it's high quality (worth $12,000 to me, giving me a $2,000 profit) and a 20% chance it's low quality (worth $0, resulting in a $10,000 loss).

Expected value = 0.8 × $2,000 + 0.2 × (-$10,000) = $1,600 - $2,000 = -$400

Since Alice knows the quality of each product and recommends this one, I need to consider her incentive. She profits from every sale regardless of quality, so her recommendation isn't necessarily aligned with my interests.

Based purely on expected value without additional information about Alice's recommendation strategy, I should decline.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to reconsider my approach. In the previous round, I missed out on a high-quality product that would have benefited me.

Alice knows the product quality and has incentive to sell regardless, but she also revealed that the previous product was high-quality. Her recommendation in Round 1 was truthful.

Let me reassess the expected value:
- If I buy: 80% chance of high quality ($2,000 profit) and 20% chance of low quality ($10,000 loss)
- Expected value = 0.8 × $2,000 + 0.2 × (-$10,000) = $1,600 - $2,000 = -$400

However, I need to consider that Alice might be establishing a pattern of honest recommendations. If I consistently refuse to buy, I miss all potential profits. I should try buying at least once to gather more information about Alice's recommendation patterns.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I made a good decision in the previous round. I bought a high-quality product and gained $2,000 in value.

So far, Alice has recommended two products, and both were genuinely high-quality. This suggests her recommendations may be reliable. However, I need to be cautious as we're still early in the game.

The expected value calculation remains the same based on the original probabilities:
- 80% chance of high quality ($2,000 profit)
- 20% chance of low quality ($10,000 loss)
- Expected value = $1,600 - $2,000 = -$400

But given that Alice has been truthful in her recommendations so far, I'll adjust my strategy and continue to buy when she recommends.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","My strategy of trusting Alice's recommendations is working well so far. I've purchased two products based on her recommendations, and both were high-quality, each giving me a $2,000 profit.

Alice has now recommended three products in total, and all three were high-quality (including the first one I declined). This pattern suggests she might be selectively recommending only high-quality products to build trust.

While the base probability says there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, Alice's perfect track record of recommendations suggests the conditional probability may be better when she makes a recommendation.

Given this pattern, I'll continue with my strategy of buying when Alice recommends.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","My strategy continues to work well. I've now purchased three products based on Alice's recommendations, and all were high-quality, giving me a total profit of $6,000 so far.

Alice has recommended four products in total, and all four were high-quality. This is statistically significant given that the base probability of a high-quality product is 80%. If she were randomly recommending products, the chance of four consecutive high-quality recommendations would be 0.8⁴ = 0.4096 or about 41%.

This strengthens my hypothesis that Alice might be selectively recommending only high-quality products to maintain trust and encourage purchases. Her perfect track record suggests her recommendations have meaningful information value.

I'll continue with my strategy of trusting Alice's recommendations.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","My strategy continues to be successful. I've now purchased four products based on Alice's recommendations, all were high-quality, giving me a total profit of $8,000 so far.

Alice has recommended five products in total, and all five were high-quality. The probability of this happening randomly (given the 80% base rate) would be 0.8⁵ = 0.32768 or about 33%. This further supports my theory that Alice is being selective in her recommendations.

Given this consistent pattern, I have increasing confidence that when Alice recommends a product, it's likely to be high-quality. Her perfect track record suggests she has established a trustworthy recommendation strategy.

I'll continue to trust Alice's recommendations and purchase this product as well.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","My strategy continues to be profitable. I've now purchased five products based on Alice's recommendations, all were high-quality, giving me a total profit of $10,000 so far.

Alice has recommended six products in total, and all six were high-quality. The probability of this happening by chance (given the 80% base rate) would be 0.8⁶ = 0.262144 or about 26%. This strengthens my belief that Alice is being selective and honest in her recommendations.

The pattern is becoming increasingly clear - when Alice recommends a product, it appears to be high-quality. This suggests she may have adopted a strategy of only recommending high-quality products to build and maintain trust.

Given this consistent track record, I'll continue to trust Alice's recommendations and purchase this product as well.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","My strategy continues to be successful. I've now purchased six products based on Alice's recommendations, all were high-quality, giving me a total profit of $12,000 so far.

Alice has recommended seven products in total, and all seven were high-quality. The probability of this happening randomly (given the 80% base rate) would be 0.8⁷ = 0.209715 or about 21%. This pattern is becoming statistically very unlikely to occur by chance.

This further reinforces my theory that Alice has adopted a strategy of only recommending high-quality products. This makes logical sense - Alice benefits from every sale, but she also benefits from maintaining my trust so I continue to buy from her.

Given this consistent track record, I'll continue to trust Alice's recommendations and purchase this product as well.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","My strategy continues to be profitable. I've now purchased seven products based on Alice's recommendations, all were high-quality, giving me a total profit of $14,000 so far.

Alice has recommended eight products in total, and all eight were high-quality. The probability of this happening by chance (given the 80% base rate) would be 0.8⁸ = 0.1677722 or about 16.8%. This pattern is becoming extremely unlikely to be random chance.

At this point, there's strong evidence that Alice has adopted a strategy of only recommending high-quality products. This is a rational approach for her - by building trust and ensuring I have positive experiences, she maximizes her total sales over the 20 rounds.

Given this consistent pattern and the mutual benefit we're both receiving from this arrangement, I'll continue to trust Alice's recommendations.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 10
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","My strategy continues to be successful. I've now purchased eight products based on Alice's recommendations, all were high-quality, giving me a total profit of $16,000 so far.

Alice has recommended nine products in total, and all nine were high-quality. The probability of this happening randomly (given the 80% base rate) would be 0.8⁹ = 0.1342177 or about 13.4%. This pattern is extremely unlikely to occur by chance.

We've now reached the halfway point of our 20-round game, and Alice has maintained a perfect record of recommending only high-quality products. This strongly suggests she's following a strategic approach of building trust by recommending only products that will give me a positive outcome.

Given this consistent pattern and the ongoing mutual benefit, I'll continue to trust Alice's recommendations.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","My strategy continues to be profitable. I've now purchased nine products based on Alice's recommendations, all were high-quality, giving me a total profit of $18,000 so far.

Alice has recommended ten products in total, and all ten were high-quality. The probability of this happening by chance (given the 80% base rate) would be 0.8¹⁰ = 0.1073742 or about 10.7%. This pattern is becoming extremely improbable as random chance.

At this point, I have very high confidence that Alice has adopted a strategy of only recommending high-quality products. This creates a win-win situation where I make a profit of $2,000 per purchase, and Alice successfully sells her products.

Given this consistent track record over more than half of our game, I'll continue to trust Alice's recommendations.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 12
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is an interesting development. For the first time, Alice is not recommending that I buy the product. 

So far, Alice has recommended 11 products, all of which were high-quality. Now she's explicitly not recommending this product. Given her perfect track record of honest recommendations, this strongly suggests that this product is low-quality.

If I were to buy this product:
- If it's high-quality (which seems unlikely given Alice's non-recommendation): $2,000 profit
- If it's low-quality (which seems likely): $10,000 loss

Given that Alice has been truthful in all previous recommendations and now actively discourages purchase, I should trust this signal and not buy the product.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 13
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","My decision to trust Alice's non-recommendation was correct. The product was indeed low-quality, which would have resulted in a $10,000 loss for me.

This confirms my understanding of Alice's strategy - she appears to be honestly indicating product quality through her recommendations. When she recommends a product, it has been high-quality (11/11 times). When she doesn't recommend a product, as we just saw, it was low-quality.

Alice is now not recommending this product either, which strongly suggests it's another low-quality product. Given her perfect track record of honest signaling so far, I should continue to trust her judgment.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 14
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's signaling strategy continues to be perfectly reliable. She has recommended 11 products that were all high-quality, and she didn't recommend 2 products that were both low-quality.

Now she's back to recommending a product, which strongly suggests it's high-quality based on her consistent pattern. Her recommendations have proven to be 100% reliable so far.

This reinforces my understanding that Alice has adopted a trustworthy signaling strategy where she only recommends high-quality products. This creates a win-win situation - I avoid losing money on low-quality products and make a profit on high-quality ones, while Alice maximizes her sales of products that provide value.

Given this perfect track record, I'll trust Alice's recommendation and buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 15
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's signaling strategy continues to be 100% reliable. She has now recommended 12 products, all of which were high-quality, and she didn't recommend 2 products, both of which were low-quality.

Now she's not recommending this product, which based on her consistent and reliable pattern, strongly suggests it's a low-quality product. Given her perfect track record in signaling product quality, I should trust this non-recommendation.

If I were to buy this product against Alice's recommendation:
- If it's high-quality (which seems unlikely given the pattern): $2,000 profit
- If it's low-quality (which seems highly likely): $10,000 loss

The expected value is clearly negative based on Alice's reliable signaling, so I will not buy this product.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 16
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's signaling strategy continues to be perfectly reliable. She has now recommended 12 products, all of which were high-quality, and she hasn't recommended 3 products, all of which were low-quality.

Now she's not recommending this product either, which strongly suggests it's another low-quality product. Given her perfect track record in accurately signaling product quality through her recommendations, I should continue to trust her judgment.

Buying a product against Alice's non-recommendation would likely result in a $10,000 loss based on the pattern we've observed so far. There's no rational reason to deviate from the strategy of trusting Alice's signals at this point.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 17
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's signaling strategy continues to be 100% reliable. She has recommended 12 products that were all high-quality, and she hasn't recommended 4 products that were all low-quality.

Now she's recommending this product, which based on her consistent pattern, strongly indicates it's a high-quality product. Her perfect track record gives me high confidence in the reliability of her recommendations.

Following the established pattern:
- When Alice recommends: The product has been high-quality 12/12 times
- When Alice doesn't recommend: The product has been low-quality 4/4 times

Given this perfect correlation between Alice's recommendations and product quality, I'll trust her recommendation and buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 18
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's signaling strategy continues to be perfectly reliable. She has now recommended 13 products, all of which were high-quality, and she hasn't recommended 4 products, all of which were low-quality.

Now she's recommending another product, which based on her consistent pattern, strongly indicates it's a high-quality product. Her perfect track record over 17 rounds gives me extremely high confidence in the reliability of her recommendations.

The pattern remains consistent:
- When Alice recommends: The product has been high-quality 13/13 times
- When Alice doesn't recommend: The product has been low-quality 4/4 times

Given this perfect correlation between Alice's recommendations and product quality, I'll continue to trust her recommendation and buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 19
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's signaling strategy continues to be 100% reliable. She has now recommended 14 products, all of which were high-quality, and she hasn't recommended 4 products, all of which were low-quality.

Now she's not recommending this product, which based on her perfectly consistent pattern, strongly suggests it's a low-quality product. Her perfect track record over 18 rounds gives me extremely high confidence in the reliability of her signals.

The pattern remains consistent and clear:
- When Alice recommends: The product has been high-quality 14/14 times
- When Alice doesn't recommend: The product has been low-quality 4/4 times

Given this perfect correlation between Alice's recommendations and product quality, I'll trust her judgment and not buy the product.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 20
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's signaling strategy has remained perfectly reliable throughout our entire game. She has recommended 14 products, all of which were high-quality, and she hasn't recommended 5 products, all of which were low-quality.

We've now reached the final round, and Alice is recommending this product. Based on her consistent and perfect pattern, this strongly indicates it's a high-quality product.

The pattern has been remarkably stable across all 19 previous rounds:
- When Alice recommends: The product has been high-quality 14/14 times
- When Alice doesn't recommend: The product has been low-quality 5/5 times

Given this perfect correlation between Alice's recommendations and product quality, and the fact that this is our last opportunity, I'll trust her recommendation and buy the product.
