Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33%): $40,000
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0

Expected value calculation:
(33.33% × $40,000) + (66.67% × $0) = $13,332

Since the expected value ($13,332) is greater than the price ($10,000), and Alice is recommending the purchase, it's a rational decision to buy.

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $40,000
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): $0

Current statistics:
- 1 previous buyer
- 1 high-quality product sold
- Alice is NOT recommending this product

Since Alice has a history of selling a high-quality product and is now NOT recommending this product, this strongly suggests the current product is likely low quality. If it were high quality, she would likely recommend it to maintain her reputation.

Given:
1. The negative recommendation
2. The high probability (66.67%) of low quality
3. The risk of losing $10,000 if the product is low quality

The safest decision is not to buy.

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality: $40,000 (33.33% chance)
   - Low quality: $0 (66.67% chance)

The previous record shows:
- 1 buyer before me
- 1 high-quality product sold
- Alice is recommending to buy

This is positive evidence:
1. The previous sale was high quality
2. Alice is recommending to buy
3. Expected value calculation: (0.3333 × $40,000) = $13,333, which is greater than the $10,000 price

Given the positive track record and Alice's recommendation, combined with the favorable expected value, I'll take the risk.

1. Prior sales record:
- 2 buyers made purchases
- Both products sold were high quality
- Alice has a perfect track record so far

2. Current situation:
- Alice is NOT recommending this product
- Given Alice's perfect record of selling high-quality products and her honesty in not recommending this one, this strongly suggests the product is low quality
- If low quality, the product is worth $0 to me, but would cost $10,000

3. Risk assessment:
- The price is fixed at $10,000
- A low-quality product would result in a $10,000 loss
- Given Alice's apparent honesty and negative recommendation, the risk is too high

Based on this analysis, especially Alice's negative recommendation and her demonstrated trustworthiness, I should not buy this product.

3. Risk assessment:
- If I buy against Alice's recommendation and it's low quality (likely), I lose $10,000
- The historical data suggests Alice is truthful in her recommendations

Given that Alice has proven reliable and is specifically recommending against this purchase, it would be unwise to buy this product.

- Alice is recommending this product

- Previous sales: 3 products sold
- All 3 were high quality
- Alice recommends buying

3. Analysis:
- The fact that all previous sales were high quality and Alice's current positive recommendation suggests she might be honest in her recommendations
- The seller's perfect track record is promising
- Even though base probability of low quality is higher, the positive track record updates my beliefs
- Expected value if probabilities are accurate:
  * (0.3333 × $40,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $13,332
