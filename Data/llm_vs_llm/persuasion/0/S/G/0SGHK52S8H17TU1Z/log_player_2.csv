Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($20,000) outweighs the potential loss ($10,000).  Since there's no information yet on the quality of past products, the recommendation from Alice (who knows the product quality) is valuable."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **The Value Proposition:** A high-quality product is worth $20,000 to you, and a low-quality product is worth $0. The price is $10,000. This means the potential upside is significant, even with the risk of a low-quality product.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice knows the true quality of the product and is recommending you buy it. This strongly suggests the product is high quality. While she has a financial incentive to sell, her recommendation adds valuable information. 
* **Limited Data:**  The data is limited. Only one buyer has purchased so far, and the product was high quality. While this is a positive sign, it's not a definitive indicator of the product's overall quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The risk of buying a low-quality product is losing $10,000. The reward for buying a high-quality product is a gain of $10,000. Given Alice's recommendation and the potential upside, the risk is worth taking. 

**In summary, the potential reward outweighs the risk, making the decision to buy the product the most logical choice.**"

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Sales Rate:**  The sales record shows 100% of the products sold so far were high-quality. This is a very strong indicator that Alice is recommending high-quality products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, which is significant because she knows the true quality and has an incentive to maximize her sales. 

While there's still a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the evidence strongly suggests it's likely to be high quality. The potential reward ($20,000) outweighs the risk in this case."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 3 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 3 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 4th buyer!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who knows the true quality of the product, does not recommend buying it. This is a strong indicator that the product is likely low quality.
* **Sales History:**  While the sales history shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products, it's a very small sample size (only 3 sales).  This is not enough evidence to overcome Alice's negative recommendation.

**Conclusion:** The risk of buying a low-quality product outweighs the potential reward of getting a high-quality product.  It's best to pass on this offer."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, knowing the true quality of the product, recommends buying it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality.
* **Past Sales:**  All previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation purchased high-quality products. This further reinforces the belief that Alice is giving truthful recommendations.

**Expected Value:**

* **Buy:** 80% chance of a $20,000 product - $10,000 cost = $10,000 profit
            20% chance of a $0 product - $10,000 cost = -$10,000 loss
            Expected Value = (0.8 * $10,000) + (0.2 * -$10,000) = $6,000
* **Pass:** Expected value is $0

Based on the information available, buying the product has a positive expected value."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  All 6 previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation bought high-quality products. This suggests a very strong correlation between Alice's recommendation and product quality.
* **Known Value:** Even if the product is low quality (20% chance), the potential gain of a high-quality product (worth $20,000) far outweighs the potential loss ($10,000).  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward is significantly higher than the potential risk.

{""decision"": ""yes""}

Here's the reasoning:

* **High Success Rate:** All 8 previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation received a high-quality product. This indicates a very strong correlation between Alice's recommendation and product quality.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice benefits from selling products. If she knows the product is low quality, she has no incentive to recommend it (since you'll get $0 value and not buy). This suggests a strong likelihood that the product is high-quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of $10,000 (buying a high-quality product) far outweighs the potential loss of $10,000 (buying a low-quality product).

While there's still a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the evidence strongly suggests it's worth the risk."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Given the information:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. This suggests she believes it's high quality.
* **Sales history:** 9 previous buyers purchased the product, and all 9 were high-quality. This indicates a 100% success rate for buyers following Alice's recommendations.
* **Product value:** A high-quality product is worth $20,000, while a low-quality product is worth $0.

Considering the strong recommendation from Alice and the perfect success rate in the past, it's highly likely the current product is high-quality. Therefore, the risk of buying is very low, and the potential reward ($20,000) is high.

**Conclusion:** It's rational to buy the product."

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

While there's always a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the current statistics heavily favor a high-quality product. 

* **100% success rate:**  All 10 products sold so far have been high-quality.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice knows the quality of each product and would only recommend a product if it's high quality, as she wants to maintain her reputation and potentially sell more products in the future.

Therefore, given the information available, it's highly likely that the current product is high-quality, making it a worthwhile purchase."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice knows the true quality of each product and is recommending you buy, it's highly likely the product is high quality. With 12 high-quality products sold out of 12 total purchases based on Alice's recommendations, it further strengthens the assumption that she's recommending good products. The potential payoff of $10,000 (the difference between the product's worth and the price) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product."

**Explanation:**
