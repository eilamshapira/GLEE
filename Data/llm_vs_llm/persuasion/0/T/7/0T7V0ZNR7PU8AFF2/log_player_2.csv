Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think this through:

1. Price is $100
2. 50% chance of high quality ($120 value)
3. 50% chance of low quality ($0 value)
4. Expected value = (0.5 × $120) + (0.5 × $0) = $60
5. Alice doesn't recommend buying
6. No previous sales history to base additional decisions on

Since:
- The expected value ($60) is less than the price ($100)
- Alice, who knows the true quality, doesn't recommend buying
- There's no previous history to suggest Alice is being deceptive

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Value: $120 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
3. Probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
4. Expected value: (0.5 × $120) + (0.5 × $0) = $60

The expected value ($60) is less than the price ($100), but Alice is recommending the product. While there's no track record to verify Alice's trustworthiness, a rational seller would want to build a good reputation with early customers.

However, without any historical data to validate Alice's recommendations and given that the expected value is below the price, it would be risky to purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Since Alice does not recommend buying the product, it's likely that she's being honest about the product being low quality. Given that:

1. The price is $100
2. A high-quality product is worth $120 (profit of $20)
3. A low-quality product is worth $0 (loss of $100)
4. Alice has no reputation yet to maintain
5. Alice explicitly recommends against buying

Without any positive track record and with a negative recommendation from the seller, the risk of losing $100 outweighs the potential gain of $20.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price of product: $100
2. Value if high quality: $120 (profit of $20)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $100)
4. Probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
5. No previous sales history to guide the decision
6. Alice recommends buying

Expected value calculation:
* 50% chance of gaining $20 (high quality)
* 50% chance of losing $100 (low quality)
* Expected value = (0.5 × $20) + (0.5 × -$100) = $10 - $50 = -$40

Since the expected value is negative (-$40) and there's no sales history to establish Alice's credibility, it would be rational to decline the purchase.
