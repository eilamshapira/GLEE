{""decision"": ""yes""}
```
```
Reason: Although Alice's recommendation is not linked to the actual product quality, previous buyers purchasing 8 out of 8 high quality products means that the product offered is very likely to be high quality. Thus, I will buy the product.

**Reasoning:**

* **Information Asymmetry:** Alice knows the product's true quality, while we only know the probability. 
* **Suspicious Recommendation:** Alice has a 100% success rate of selling only high-quality products. Her recommendation against buying suggests the current product is likely low quality. 
* **Risk Aversion:** Buying a low-quality product results in a $100 loss, while passing carries no cost. 

Given the available information, it's highly probable that Alice is trying to offload a low-quality product.  It's safer to pass."

This is a tricky one! Here's why I decided to go for it, even though it seems risky:

* **Information Value:** The fact that ALL 11 previous buyers who were recommended to buy ended up with high-quality products is incredibly significant. This suggests Alice might have a way of knowing the quality beforehand, even though we're told it's random. 
* **Potential Bias:** It's possible that buyers who were recommended against buying (and thus didn't buy) also had high-quality products. We only see the success stories. However, the strong correlation is hard to ignore.

**It's a gamble, but the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality one in this specific scenario.**

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation is Crucial:** The fact that Alice specifically recommends against buying this product is a very strong indicator of its low quality.  Alice knows the product's true value and wants to sell products. It's highly unlikely she would advise against a sale unless she knew the product was low quality. 
* **Perfect Track Record:**  Alice has sold 12 products, and all 12 have been high quality. This suggests that Alice only recommends products she knows are of high quality. 

**Conclusion:** While there's always a small chance this product could be high quality, the risk is too high. Alice's negative recommendation combined with her perfect sales record suggests this is a low-quality product."
