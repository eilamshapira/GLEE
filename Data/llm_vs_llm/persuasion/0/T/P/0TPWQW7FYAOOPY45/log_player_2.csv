"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to think about whether to buy this product.

Alice is recommending I buy the product. Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality. 

If I buy:
- If high quality: I pay $1,000,000 and get $1,250,000 in value (profit of $250,000)
- If low quality: I pay $1,000,000 and get $0 in value (loss of $1,000,000)

Expected value = 0.5 × $250,000 + 0.5 × (-$1,000,000) = $125,000 - $500,000 = -$375,000

Since Alice knows the product quality and is recommending I buy, she might have information that it's high quality. However, since this is the first round, I don't have any prior data on whether her recommendations are trustworthy.

Given that the expected value is negative based on the prior probability, I'll decline this purchase until I have more information about Alice's recommendation patterns.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to think about this situation.

Alice did not recommend that I buy this product. In round 1, she recommended I buy a product that turned out to be high quality, which suggests her recommendations may have some value.

If I buy:
- If high quality: I pay $1,000,000 and get $1,250,000 in value (profit of $250,000)
- If low quality: I pay $1,000,000 and get $0 in value (loss of $1,000,000)

Given that Alice is now actively recommending against buying this product, and her previous recommendation was accurate, there's a higher probability this product is low quality.

It seems Alice may be giving honest recommendations, though I only have one data point so far. Since she's recommending against buying, and the downside of buying a low-quality product ($1,000,000 loss) is much greater than the upside of a high-quality one ($250,000 gain), I should follow her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate this situation.

So far, Alice's recommendations have been accurate:
- Round 1: Alice recommended buying → Product was high quality
- Round 2: Alice recommended not buying → Product was low quality

This suggests Alice may be giving honest recommendations about product quality. If her pattern continues, this product is likely high quality since she's recommending I buy it.

If I buy:
- If high quality: I pay $1,000,000 and get $1,250,000 in value (profit of $250,000)
- If low quality: I pay $1,000,000 and get $0 in value (loss of $1,000,000)

Given Alice's track record so far, I'm more confident in following her recommendation. The expected value calculation shifts in favor of buying if I assign a higher probability to this being a high-quality product based on her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate this situation.

Alice's recommendations have been accurate in all three previous rounds:
- Round 1: Alice recommended buying → Product was high quality
- Round 2: Alice recommended not buying → Product was low quality
- Round 3: Alice recommended buying → Product was high quality

Her pattern of honest recommendations is holding up consistently. Now she's recommending that I do not buy this product, which suggests it's likely low quality.

If I buy:
- If high quality: I pay $1,000,000 and get $1,250,000 in value (profit of $250,000)
- If low quality: I pay $1,000,000 and get $0 in value (loss of $1,000,000)

Given Alice's perfect track record so far, the smart move is to follow her recommendation and not buy this product.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

- Round 3: Alice recommended buying → Product was high quality
- Round 4: Alice recommended not buying → Product was low quality

This perfect pattern suggests Alice is giving honest recommendations about product quality. Now she's recommending that I buy this product, which suggests it's likely high quality.

If I buy:
- If high quality: I pay $1,000,000 and get $1,250,000 in value (profit of $250,000)
- If low quality: I pay $1,000,000 and get $0 in value (loss of $1,000,000)

Given Alice's consistent track record, I should follow her recommendation and buy this product.

- If low quality: I pay $1,000,000 and get $0 in value (loss of $1,000,000)
