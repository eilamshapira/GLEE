The expected value of the product is calculated as follows:

Expected Value = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality)

In this case:

* Probability of High Quality = 33.33% = 0.3333
* Value of High Quality = $3,000,000
* Probability of Low Quality = 66.67% = 0.6667
* Value of Low Quality = $0

Expected Value = (0.3333 * $3,000,000) + (0.6667 * $0) = $1,000,000

Since the price of the product ($1,000,000) is equal to its expected value, it's a fair gamble.  Therefore, the decision to buy is justified from a purely mathematical perspective.  Any additional information (like past sales data) doesn't change the inherent expected value of *this particular* product."
