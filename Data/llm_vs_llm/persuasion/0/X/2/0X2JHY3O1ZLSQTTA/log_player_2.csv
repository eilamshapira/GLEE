Explanation: Given the odds, buying at $1,000,000 each round has a negative expected value. The expected value for each round is:

(0.3333 * $4,000,000) + (0.6667 * $0) - $1,000,000 = $333,000

So, on average, buying each round would result in a loss of $667,000. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to always pass."
