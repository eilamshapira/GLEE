"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the provided information:
- Total buyers before you: 1
- High-quality products sold: 1
- Therefore, 100% of the products sold have been high-quality, based on a small sample size.

Alice's recommendation is not to buy the product, which might indicate that the current product is low-quality. However, given the current statistics (1 out of 1), it might seem tempting to take the risk for a potential high reward.

Despite the high success rate so far, the sample size is very small, and Alice's recommendation is likely based on the product being low-quality.

Let's decide:

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To analyze the situation:

- There have been 3 buyers before me.
- All 3 buyers purchased the products offered to them.
- Alice recommended purchasing each time, and all 3 products turned out to be high quality.

Given that Alice has recommended you to buy the product and has a perfect track record with 3 out of 3 high-quality products being sold based on her recommendation, it's reasonable to infer a strong likelihood that the recommendation is good.

Therefore, I will choose to buy the product.
