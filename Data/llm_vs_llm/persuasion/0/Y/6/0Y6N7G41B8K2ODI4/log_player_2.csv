"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this scenario.

When Alice recommends a product, I need to consider whether her recommendation is credible and whether buying is profitable in expectation.

Given:
- Product price: $10,000
- High-quality product value: $40,000
- Low-quality product value: $0
- Prior probability of high quality: 80%

Since this is the first round, I have no pattern of Alice's recommendation behavior. I need to rely on the prior probabilities.

Expected value of buying = (0.8 × $40,000) + (0.2 × $0) - $10,000 = $32,000 - $10,000 = $22,000

Since the expected value is positive, it makes sense to buy.
