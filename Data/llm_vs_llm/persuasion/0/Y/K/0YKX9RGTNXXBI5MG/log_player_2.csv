Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the outcomes so far, let's reevaluate the strategy. Buying every product might not be optimal since there's a higher chance of getting a low-quality product. Let's consider the expected value:

- Expected value of a product: (0.3333 * $30,000) + (0.6667 * $0) = $10,000
- Cost of a product: $10,000

The expected value matches the cost, but given the recent losses, it might be prudent to be more selective. However, since Alice's recommendation doesn't provide additional information, we'll continue with the initial strategy for now.

Since Alice's recommendation does not provide additional information, and the probability of getting a low-quality product is higher, it might be wise to start passing on some products to minimize losses.
