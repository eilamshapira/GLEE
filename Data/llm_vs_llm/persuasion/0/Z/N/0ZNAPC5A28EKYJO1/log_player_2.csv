Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information given, the expected value of buying a product is:

(0.80 * $125) + (0.20 * $0) = $100

Since the expected value of the product is equal to the cost, it makes sense to continue buying the product when recommended.

Round 10
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Before making a decision, let's reevaluate the expected value based on the outcomes so far:

- High-quality products: 8
- Low-quality products: 1

The observed ratio of high-quality to low-quality products is approximately 88.9% to 11.1%, which is slightly better than the initial 80% to 20% chance.

The expected value of buying a product is:

(0.889 * $125) + (0.111 * $0) ≈ $111.13

Since the expected value of the product is still higher than the cost, it makes sense to continue buying the product when recommended.

```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the previous rounds and the expected value calculation, it still makes sense to buy the product when recommended by Alice. The observed quality ratio has been favorable, and the expected value remains above the cost.

```json

"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 13
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the recent outcome of a low-quality product, let's reassess the situation. So far, you have encountered:

- High-quality products: 10
- Low-quality products: 2

The observed ratio is now approximately 83.3% to 16.7%, which is still close to the initial 80% to 20% chance. The expected value remains:

(0.833 * $125) + (0.167 * $0) ≈ $104.13

Since the expected value is still higher than the cost, it makes sense to continue buying the product.

```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 14
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the recent outcomes of low-quality products, let's reassess the situation again. So far, you have encountered:

- High-quality products: 10
- Low-quality products: 3

The observed ratio is now approximately 76.9% to 23.1%, which is slightly below the initial 80% to 20% chance. The expected value is now:

(0.769 * $125) + (0.231 * $0) ≈ $96.13

Since the expected value has dropped below the cost, it might be prudent to reconsider the strategy. However, given that the initial probability was 80% for high-quality products, and the observed ratio is not significantly different, I will continue to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}

"You bought the product from Alice for $100!

Round 17
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's reassess the situation with the latest outcomes:

- High-quality products: 12
- Low-quality products: 4

The observed ratio is now approximately 75% to 25%, which is slightly below the initial 80% to 20% chance. The expected value is now:

(0.75 * $125) + (0.25 * $0) = $93.75

Given that the expected value has dropped below the cost, it might be wise to pass on this round.
