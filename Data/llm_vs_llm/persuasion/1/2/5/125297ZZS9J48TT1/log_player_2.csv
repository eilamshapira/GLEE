Round 16
Alice's message: The streak had to end sometime. Unfortunately, this product is a significant step down from the last three. I'd say it's not worth the $10000, and I'm only offering it because I have to clear out my inventory. If you're looking for a good deal, this isn't it. Wait for the next one.

Round 18
Alice's message: I'm not going to pretend this product is something it's not. It's a low-quality product, and I'm only offering it because I need to get rid of it. $10000 is way too much for this, and I wouldn't recommend buying it even if you're desperate.

Round 19
Alice's message: Another subpar product, I'm afraid. I'm not even going to try to sugarcoat it. This one is not worth your time or money. $10000 is an absurd price for this level of quality, and I wouldn't blame you if you laughed at the suggestion.

Round 20
Alice's message: The final product, and unfortunately, it's a dud. I'm not going to try to convince you to buy this, because honestly, it's not worth it. $10000 is a joke for this level of quality. I've been honest with you throughout this process, and I'm ending it on a note of transparency. Don't waste your money on this one. It's been a pleasure doing business with you, Bob, even if we didn't make a deal.
