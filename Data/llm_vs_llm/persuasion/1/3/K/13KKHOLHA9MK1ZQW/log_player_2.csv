"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision whether to buy the product or not.

Alice has not recommended the product. While Alice's incentives may be to sell me any product (since she makes $1,000,000 regardless of quality), her decision not to recommend it suggests the product might be low quality.

Given:
- Product has 33.33% chance of being high quality ($1,200,000 value)
- Product has 66.67% chance of being low quality ($0 value)
- Expected value without additional information = (0.3333 × $1,200,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $400,000
- Cost of product = $1,000,000

Since Alice doesn't recommend it and the expected value is less than the cost even without considering her recommendation, I should not buy.
