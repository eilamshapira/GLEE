Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality (50%): $12,000
   - Low quality (50%): $0

3. Expected value = (0.5 × $12,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $6,000

4. Alice has recommended buying, but:
   - No prior sales history to establish trust
   - Alice has incentive to sell regardless of quality
   - Expected value ($6,000) is less than price ($10,000)

Even with Alice's recommendation, the expected value is lower than the asking price, making this a negative expected value decision.

3. Expected value calculation:

4. Considerations:
   - The expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000)
   - No previous sales history to validate Alice's reliability
   - Alice's recommendation could be biased as she wants to make the sale
   - The risk of losing the entire investment is significant

Given that the expected value is lower than the asking price, and there's no track record to trust Alice's recommendation, it would be financially unwise to make this purchase.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $10,000
2. Value if high quality: $12,000 (profit of $2,000)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $10,000)
4. Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
5. Alice recommends buying

Without any sales history, I can only rely on the base probabilities and Alice's recommendation. However, since Alice is trying to sell all products, her recommendation might not be entirely reliable.

Expected value calculation:
* 50% chance of $2,000 profit = $1,000
* 50% chance of $10,000 loss = -$5,000
* Net expected value = -$4,000

Since the expected value is negative, even with Alice's recommendation, it would be risky to be the first buyer.

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - 50% chance of $12,000 (high quality)
   - 50% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $12,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $6,000

Since Alice recommends buying, this might suggest the product is high quality. However, since there's no previous sales history to establish Alice's credibility, I can only rely on the base probabilities.

The expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000), so it would not be rational to buy.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Price is $10,000
2. High quality (worth $12,000) probability is 50%
3. Low quality (worth $0) probability is 50%
4. Alice does not recommend buying
5. No previous sales history to reference

The expected value without considering Alice's recommendation would be:
(50% × $12,000) + (50% × $0) = $6,000

Since Alice does not recommend buying and she knows the true quality, this suggests the product might be low quality. Given that the expected value is already below the asking price ($6,000 < $10,000) and the negative recommendation, it would be wise to decline.

3. The price is $10,000
4. Alice doesn't recommend buying
5. As the seller, Alice wants to sell the product, so if she's recommending against buying, that's a strong negative signal

Given that Alice is advising against the purchase despite having an incentive to sell, and considering that the expected value would be $6,000 (50% × $12,000 + 50% × $0) even without this negative signal, it's best to avoid this purchase.
