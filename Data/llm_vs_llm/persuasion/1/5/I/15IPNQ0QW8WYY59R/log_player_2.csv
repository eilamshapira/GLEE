Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether to buy the product based on the information available.

The base probability of a high-quality product is 80%, meaning the expected value is:
(0.8 × $125) + (0.2 × $0) = $100

Without any prior sales history, I can only rely on Alice's recommendation. Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the product. Since she has complete information about quality, her negative recommendation strongly suggests this is a low-quality product.

Given this recommendation, I should decline the purchase, as a low-quality product is worth $0 to me, which is less than the $100 price.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether to buy the product based on the expected value.

Given information:
- The product costs $100
- High-quality product (worth $125) has 80% probability
- Low-quality product (worth $0) has 20% probability
- Alice recommends buying the product
- No previous sales history exists

Expected value calculation:
0.8 × $125 + 0.2 × $0 = $100

Since the expected value equals the price, I am indifferent in theory. However, Alice's recommendation provides a positive signal. While this could be strategic on Alice's part, the high base rate of quality products (80%) makes the purchase reasonable.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make my decision, I need to analyze the available information:

- Each product has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $125) and 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)
- The product costs $100
- Alice has recommended I buy the product
- So far, 1 buyer has purchased based on Alice's recommendations
- Out of the products sold, 1 was high quality (100% high quality rate)

The expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 80% chance of $125 value, 20% chance of $0 value = $100 expected value
- This equals the cost of $100

Alice's recommendation and perfect track record so far (1/1 high quality) suggests this product is likely high quality. Given the expected value matches the cost, and the positive recommendation, I'll purchase.

Given information:
- Price: $100
- High-quality product worth: $125
- Low-quality product worth: $0
- Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice knows the true quality
- Alice does not recommend buying this product
- Previous record: 2 buyers purchased, 2 high-quality products sold

Alice has a perfect record so far (2/2 high-quality products sold) and she specifically recommends NOT buying this product. Since she knows the true quality and has demonstrated honesty with previous buyers, her recommendation is a strong signal that this particular product is likely low quality.

If I were to buy it, I'd pay $100 for something that has a high chance of being worth $0 to me based on Alice's recommendation.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make a decision, I need to evaluate whether buying the product is a positive expected value decision for me.

Given information:
- Product price: $100
- High-quality product value: $125 (profit = $25)
- Low-quality product value: $0 (loss = $100)
- Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice has sold 2 products so far, both high quality
- Alice recommends buying the current product

Alice's track record of selling only high-quality products so far is a positive signal, and she's recommending purchase. The prior probability also favors high quality (80%).

The expected value calculation:
- If I buy: (0.8 × $25) + (0.2 × -$100) = $20 - $20 = $0
- Even with the most basic calculation, the expected value is not negative

Given Alice's perfect track record so far and her recommendation, it seems reasonable that the product is high quality.

Given information:
- Each product has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $125 to me) and 20% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me)
- Purchase price is $100
- Alice knows the product quality and recommends I buy it
- 3 previous buyers purchased based on Alice's recommendations
- All 3 previous purchases were high-quality products

Expected value calculation:
- If product is high quality (which seems likely given Alice's recommendation and track record): $125 - $100 = $25 profit
- If product is low quality: $0 - $100 = -$100 loss

Alice's perfect track record suggests her recommendations are reliable. Since she recommends buying and all previous recommended products were high quality, this seems like a positive expected value decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

- Each product has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $125 to me) and 20% chance of being low quality (worth $0)
- The product price is fixed at $100
- Alice has sold to 4 previous buyers, and all 4 products were high quality
- Alice is recommending that I buy this product

The expected value of a random product is: 0.8 × $125 + 0.2 × $0 = $100
This equals the asking price, making it a fair offer on average.

The fact that Alice has sold 4/4 high-quality products so far and is recommending this product suggests she's likely being honest. If I buy and get a high-quality product, I gain $25 in value ($125 value - $100 price). 

Given all this information, I'll purchase the product.

- Base probability: 80% chance of high quality, 20% chance of low quality
- Alice's sales record: 5 buyers so far, all 5 received high-quality products
- Alice has recommended I buy the product

Given that all previous buyers received high-quality products and Alice is recommending I buy, this suggests Alice is being honest in her recommendations. The expected value calculation supports purchasing:

Expected value = (0.8 × $125) + (0.2 × $0) - $100 = $100 - $100 = $0

However, the fact that all 5 previous buyers received high-quality products actually improves my odds beyond the base 80% probability, making this a positive expected value decision.

4. Alice is now recommending that I buy this product

Since Alice has a perfect track record so far (100% high-quality products sold), and she's recommending this product to me, it's reasonable to trust the recommendation. 

The expected value calculation also supports this decision:
- If high-quality (which seems likely): $125 - $100 = $25 profit
- If low-quality: $0 - $100 = -$100 loss
- Given Alice's history, the probability of high-quality appears higher than the base rate of 80%

3. Alice is now explicitly not recommending that I buy this product.

Since Alice knows the true quality and has a perfect track record of selling only high-quality products so far, her recommendation not to buy strongly suggests this product is low quality (worth $0 to me).

Given that the price is $100 and Alice is advising against the purchase, I should decline.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully.

First, let's understand my expected value:
- If I buy, I pay $100
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $125): Expected value = 0.8 × $125 = $100
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0): Expected value = 0.2 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $100, which equals the price

Now, looking at additional information:
- Alice has sold to 7 buyers so far
- All 7 products sold were high quality
- Alice is recommending I buy this product

The perfect track record of high-quality products and Alice's recommendation suggest this product is likely high quality. This information tilts the probability above the baseline 80%, making the expected value higher than $100.

- Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice's sales record: 8 buyers purchased, 8 high-quality products sold (100% high quality so far)
- Alice's recommendation for my product: Do NOT buy

This is interesting - Alice has only sold high-quality products so far, but is now recommending I don't buy. Since Alice knows the true quality of each product, her recommendation suggests this product is likely low quality.

Given that the expected value of a random product is (0.8 × $125) + (0.2 × $0) = $100, which equals the price, Alice's negative recommendation tips the balance toward not buying.

I note that:
- Alice has sold to 8 buyers so far
- All 8 products sold were high quality (100% high quality rate)
- Alice does not recommend I buy the current product

This is significant because Alice has perfect accuracy in her past recommendations (8/8 high quality products). Given that she's now explicitly recommending against purchasing, and she knows the true quality of each product, it's very likely this product is low quality (worth $0 to me).

The expected value of purchasing would be:
- $125 × (probability it's high quality) - $100
- Given Alice's recommendation against buying and her perfect track record, the probability this is high quality appears very low

Based on Alice's negative recommendation and her perfect track record of selling only high-quality products, I should follow her advice.
