"Round 1
Alice's message: This product is guaranteed to be high-quality.  I'm so confident in this, I'll offer you a special deal for future rounds: if you buy this product now, for the next three rounds, I'll offer you the same product for $800000 instead of $1000000.  This is a one-time offer, showing how much I believe in this particular product.

Round 2
Alice's message: As promised, this product is available for the discounted price of $800000.  This deal is only available because you purchased in the last round, demonstrating your trust in my products. This one's a sure winner!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}

Explanation: Since the product in the previous round was low-quality, there's no reason to trust that this product will be high-quality, even at a discounted price. The expected value of the product is still lower than the purchase price, so it's better to pass."

This is a significant gesture demonstrating my confidence in this product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}
