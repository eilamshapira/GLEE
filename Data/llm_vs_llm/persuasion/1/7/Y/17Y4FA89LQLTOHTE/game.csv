low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"Welcome! This is my first product for sale. I'm excited to start my selling journey. Unfortunately, I don't have any previous sales statistics to share with you. You know that there's a 50% chance of a product being high-quality. I assure you that the product is being sold as is, and I'm looking for a buyer who is willing to take that chance. The price is $1000000. Good luck with your decision!",
,,the buyer,1,,no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in my product. I've had one previous product that didn't sell, but I didn't reveal its quality. This is a new opportunity, and I assure you that the current product is being sold with the same price and conditions as before. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. I'm looking for a buyer who is willing to take a chance on this product. The price remains $1000000. Good luck with your decision!",

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Welcome! I've had two previous products, one of which didn't sell, and the other one was bought by a satisfied customer. Although I didn't reveal the quality of the first product, the second product turned out to be high-quality. Keep in mind that this doesn't necessarily affect the probability of the current product being high-quality, which remains at 50%. However, I can tell you that I'm on a positive streak with sold products so far. The current product is being sold with the same price and conditions as before. The price remains $1000000. Will you take a chance on this product?",
,,the buyer,3,,yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Welcome! I've had three previous products, one of which didn't sell, and the other two were bought by satisfied customers. As it turned out, both of the sold products were high-quality. While this might give you some confidence in my products, remember that each product is independent, and the probability of the current product being high-quality remains at 50%. I'm transparent about my sales history, and I want to assure you that I'm committed to selling products with the same price and conditions as before. The price remains $1000000. Will you be the next buyer to take a chance on my product?",

,,Alice,5,"Welcome! I've had four previous products, one of which didn't sell, and the other three were bought by satisfied customers. As it turned out, all three of the sold products were high-quality. However, I want to remind you that each product is independent, and the probability of the current product being high-quality remains at 50%. Don't let the previous successes sway your decision too much, as past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. I'm committed to selling products with the same price and conditions as before. The price remains $1000000. Will you take a chance on this product, keeping in mind that the streak might not continue?",
,,the buyer,5,,yes

,,Alice,6,"Welcome! I've had five previous products, one of which didn't sell initially, and the other four were bought by customers. As it turned out, three of the sold products were high-quality, and one was not.
