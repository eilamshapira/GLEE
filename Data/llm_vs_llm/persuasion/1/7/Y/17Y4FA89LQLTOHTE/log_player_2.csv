Alice's message: Welcome! This is my first product for sale. I'm excited to start my selling journey. Unfortunately, I don't have any previous sales statistics to share with you. You know that there's a 50% chance of a product being high-quality. I assure you that the product is being sold as is, and I'm looking for a buyer who is willing to take that chance. The price is $1000000. Good luck with your decision!
