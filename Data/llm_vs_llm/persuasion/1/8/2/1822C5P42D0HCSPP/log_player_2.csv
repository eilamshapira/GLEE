Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. Prior probability of high quality: 33.33%
2. Price: $1,000,000
3. Expected value without recommendation:
   * High quality (33.33%): $3,000,000
   * Low quality (66.67%): $0
   * Expected value = $1,000,000

4. Alice knows the true quality and does NOT recommend buying
5. This negative recommendation likely indicates it's a low-quality product
6. Since Alice has no previous sales history, we can't evaluate her credibility

Given Alice's negative recommendation and the fact that she knows the true quality, it's likely this is a low-quality product. If it's low quality, I would lose $1,000,000.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $3,000,000
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): $0

3. Expected value without additional information:
   (0.3333 × $3,000,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $1,000,000

4. Key factor: Alice's recommendation
   - Alice knows the true quality
   - Alice does NOT recommend buying
   - Alice has no established track record yet

Given that Alice knows the true value and is not recommending the purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. Since a low-quality product is worth $0, it would be unwise to pay $1,000,000 for it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. Prior probability of high quality: 33.33%
2. Price: $1,000,000
3. Value if high quality: $3,000,000
4. Value if low quality: $0
5. Alice doesn't recommend buying
6. No prior sales history to reference

Given that Alice knows the true value and doesn't recommend buying, this is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. While Alice could be strategic in her recommendation, there's no clear incentive for her to lie in this case since she gets the same fixed price either way.

Expected value calculation:
- Even with the base probability (33.33%), expected value would be: (0.3333 × $3,000,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $1,000,000
- With Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of high quality is likely even lower

Therefore, the expected value is less than the asking price of $1,000,000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. Prior probabilities:
- 33.33% chance of high quality ($3M value)
- 66.67% chance of low quality ($0 value)

2. Alice's recommendation:
- Alice knows the true quality
- Alice does not recommend buying
- This suggests the product is likely low quality

3. Expected value without recommendation:

- This equals the asking price

4. With Alice's negative recommendation:
- The probability of high quality is likely even lower
- Expected value would be below $1M

Given Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying, plus the high stakes involved ($1M purchase price), the rational decision is not to buy.

However, Alice has given me a negative recommendation. Since Alice knows the true quality and has provided this recommendation, this likely indicates the product is low quality. While Alice's incentives aren't completely clear, the negative recommendation from someone who knows the true quality is a strong signal.

1. Base probabilities:
- 33.33% chance of high quality ($3M value)
- 66.67% chance of low quality ($0 value)
- Price is $1M

2. Expected value without any additional information:

3. Additional information:
- Alice knows the true quality
- Alice does not recommend buying
- This is the first potential sale

Given that Alice knows the true value and is not recommending the purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. It would be rational for Alice to recommend high-quality products since they provide value above the price.

Therefore, I should not buy the product.
