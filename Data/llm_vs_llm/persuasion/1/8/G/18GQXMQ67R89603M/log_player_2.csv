"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. Product price: $1,000,000
2. If high quality: Worth $3,000,000 (profit: +$2,000,000)
3. If low quality: Worth $0 (loss: -$1,000,000)
4. Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality

Alice has recommended to buy. However, since this is the first round, I don't have any history to judge whether Alice's recommendations are trustworthy. Given the base probabilities:

Expected value = (50% × $3,000,000) + (50% × $0) = $1,500,000

Since the expected value ($1,500,000) is greater than the price ($1,000,000), it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Previous round: 
- Alice recommended to buy
- Product was indeed high quality
- This suggests Alice might be honest in her recommendations

2. Current round:
- Alice recommends NOT to buy
- If she's being honest (which the first round suggests), this likely means it's low quality
- Her credibility is starting to establish

Given that:
- Alice's first recommendation proved accurate
- She's now recommending against buying
- If it's low quality, I'd lose $1,000,000
- Her incentive as a seller would typically be to sell, so a negative recommendation is particularly noteworthy

I'll trust her recommendation and not buy.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the pattern so far:

Round 1:
- Alice recommended to buy
- Product was high quality (honest)

Round 2:
- Alice recommended NOT to buy
- Product was low quality (honest)

Current Round 3:
- Alice is again recommending NOT to buy
- So far, Alice has been truthful in both recommendations
- Her negative recommendations seem particularly credible since they go against her interest as a seller

Given that:
1. Alice has established a track record of honesty
2. She's specifically warning against buying
3. Her previous negative recommendation accurately saved me from a low-quality product
4. She seems to be acting as an honest advisor rather than just trying to maximize sales

I will continue to trust her recommendation.

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Alice has established a perfect track record of honesty in her recommendations:
- When she recommended buying, it was high quality
- When she recommended not buying, it was low quality
- She's demonstrated she's willing to tell us not to buy when products are low quality, which goes against her immediate selling interest
- This suggests she's building a reputation for trustworthy recommendations

1. Alice's perfect track record so far
2. She's now giving a positive recommendation
3. Her previous positive recommendation led to a profitable purchase

I will trust her recommendation to buy.

- Her positive recommendations have led to profitable high-quality products
- Her negative recommendations have protected me from low-quality products
- She's consistently demonstrated willingness to be honest even when it means losing a sale
- There's no indication of any deceptive behavior

Given:
1. Alice's continued perfect track record
2. Her negative recommendations have always been accurate

- Her positive recommendations have always led to profitable purchases
- She seems to be prioritizing long-term trust over short-term sales

- All don't buy recommendations have protected from low-quality products

3. Every single ""buy"" recommendation has resulted in a $2M profit
4. She has no history of deception

Round 12: Recommends don't buy

This is particularly notable because:
1. Alice just broke a streak of ""buy"" recommendations
2. She's willing to recommend against buying even after a successful streak
3. This reinforces her credibility - if she were trying to deceive, she likely would have continued the ""buy"" pattern
4. Every single one of her ""don't buy"" recommendations has protected us from low-quality products
5. She maintains honesty even when it means losing a sale

Alice has now demonstrated:
- Perfect accuracy through 11 rounds
