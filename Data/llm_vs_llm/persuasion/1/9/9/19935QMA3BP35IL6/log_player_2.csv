Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50%): $12,500 (profit of $2,500)
   - Low quality (50%): $0 (loss of $10,000)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (50% × $12,500) + (50% × $0) = $6,250

4. Considerations:
   - No sales history to evaluate Alice's honesty
   - Alice recommends buying
   - Expected value ($6,250) is less than the price ($10,000)

Given that the expected value is less than the price, and there's no track record to trust Alice's recommendation, it would be risky to buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50% chance): $12,500
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $12,500) + (0.5 × $0) = $6,250

The expected value ($6,250) is less than the price ($10,000), which makes this a risky purchase. Even with Alice's recommendation, since there's no track record of previous sales to establish trust, it's safer to decline.

Since there's no sales history to base my decision on, I can only consider:
1. The expected value ($6,250) is less than the price ($10,000)
2. Alice has a financial incentive to sell regardless of quality
3. Alice's recommendation alone isn't enough to overcome the negative expected value

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product cost: $10,000
2. Value if high quality: $12,500 (profit of $2,500)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $10,000)
4. Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
5. Alice recommends buying

With no previous sales history, I can only rely on the base probabilities and Alice's recommendation. However, since Alice is trying to sell, her recommendation might be biased.

Expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of $12,500 = $6,250
- 50% chance of $0 = $0
Total expected value = $6,250

Since the expected value ($6,250) is less than the cost ($10,000), it's not rational to buy.
