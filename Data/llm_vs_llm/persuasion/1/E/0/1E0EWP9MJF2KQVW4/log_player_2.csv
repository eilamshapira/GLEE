"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully.

Alice recommends buying the product, but I need to determine if her recommendation is reliable.

Initially, I know:
- The product costs $100
- It has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $200 to me)
- It has a 20% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me)
- Alice knows the true quality

Without more information about Alice's incentives or past behavior, I should calculate the expected value based on the prior probabilities:

Expected value = (0.8 × $200) + (0.2 × $0) = $160

Since the expected value ($160) exceeds the cost ($100), I should buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully.

Alice does not recommend buying the product in this round. This is interesting information since:

1. In Round 1, she recommended buying, and the product was indeed high quality.
2. Now she's recommending against buying.
3. Alice knows the true quality of each product.

Since Alice knows the quality and is explicitly recommending against purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If I were to buy it:
- If high quality (which seems unlikely given her recommendation): I gain $100 ($200 value - $100 cost)
- If low quality (which seems likely given her recommendation): I lose $100 ($0 value - $100 cost)

Given Alice's recommendation against buying and the fact that she has accurate information, I should follow her advice.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully.

In this round, Alice is recommending that I buy the product. Based on her track record, there's good reason to trust her recommendation, suggesting the product is high quality.

If the product is high quality (worth $200) and I pay $100, I would gain $100 in value.

Since Alice's recommendations have aligned with the true quality so far, and she's recommending purchase, I should follow her advice.
