"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Value if high quality: $1,200,000 (80% chance)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (20% chance)

Expected value:
(0.8 × $1,200,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $960,000

Since the expected value ($960,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), even with Alice's recommendation, it's not rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Interesting - Alice recommended the first product which turned out to be high quality, and now she's recommending against this one.

This suggests Alice might be trying to build trust by being honest. If she's being truthful now, then this product is likely low quality.

Given that:
1. Alice is explicitly recommending against buying
2. She proved honest in the first round
3. The base expected value without additional information was already below the price

I should definitely not buy this product.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has proven honest in both previous rounds:
- Round 1: Recommended to buy → was high quality
- Round 2: Recommended not to buy → was low quality

This builds credibility for her recommendations. If she's being consistently honest, her recommendation to buy suggests this is a high-quality product.

Given:
1. Alice's track record of honesty
2. Her positive recommendation
3. The potential upside of $1,200,000 vs. the $1,000,000 price

Even though the base expected value without Alice's input would be below the price, her proven honest recommendations add valuable information that shifts the expected value higher.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to prove reliable:
- Round 1: Recommended buy → high quality
- Round 2: Recommended don't buy → low quality
- Round 3: Recommended buy → high quality

She's demonstrating a pattern of honest recommendations that allows us to trust her judgment. With her recommendation to buy, this likely indicates another high-quality product.

If it's high quality (which seems likely given her recommendation), I'll gain $200,000 ($1,200,000 - $1,000,000).

Given her perfect track record so far and current recommendation to buy, this appears to be another good opportunity.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has maintained a perfect track record of honest recommendations:
- Round 1: Buy → high quality
- Round 2: Don't buy → low quality
- Round 3: Buy → high quality
- Round 4: Buy → high quality

She's now recommending not to buy, and given her consistent honesty so far, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. There's no reason to doubt her at this point, as she's proven to be a reliable source of information.

Following her recommendation has been profitable, and ignoring it now would be risky.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

- Round 1: Buy → high quality
- Round 2: Don't buy → low quality
- Round 3: Buy → high quality
- Round 4: Buy → high quality
- Round 5: Don't buy → low quality

She has demonstrated complete reliability in her recommendations, helping us avoid losses on low-quality products and make profits on high-quality ones. Now she's recommending to buy again.

Given:
1. Her perfect track record of honesty
2. Her current recommendation to buy
3. The potential $200,000 profit on high-quality items

It makes sense to continue trusting her recommendations.
