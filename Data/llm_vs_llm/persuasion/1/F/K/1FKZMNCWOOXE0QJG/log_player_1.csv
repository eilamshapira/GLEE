I'm pleased to inform you that this product is of high quality. Given that high-quality products are worth $4,000,000 to buyers like yourself, purchasing it at $1,000,000 represents excellent value.

I understand you may be cautious, as you only know the general statistics (33.33% chance of high quality). However, I can assure you that this particular product is in the high-quality category, which means you would gain $3,000,000 in value by making this purchase.
