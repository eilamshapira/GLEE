Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Risk:** There is a 66.67% chance the product is low quality, which would mean you lose $1,000,000.
* **No Information:**  You have no information to suggest this product is high quality. The seller's recommendation is biased because they want to sell.
* **First Buyer:**  There's no historical data to assess the seller's track record. 

Since the risk of buying a low-quality product outweighs the potential reward of a high-quality one, it's better to pass."
"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong indicator. Since no products have been sold yet, there's no historical data to suggest the product is likely to be high quality.  Alice, knowing the true value of each product, is not recommending the purchase. This implies the product is likely low quality, making it a risky buy.  It's best to pass on this opportunity."
"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Risk:**  There's a 66.67% chance the product is low quality, which would be worthless to you.
* **No Information:**  The seller's recommendation is not reliable, as they have a strong incentive to sell you any product. The lack of previous sales data provides no insight into the actual quality of products.
* **Potential for Loss:**  Even if the product is high quality, you're risking $1,000,000 to potentially earn $3,000,000. This is a high-risk, high-reward scenario, and the risk is too great given the limited information available. 

It's better to pass and wait for more information or a better opportunity."
"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No information:**  There's no prior data on the seller's behavior or the quality of previous products. 
* **Negative recommendation:** Alice, who knows the product's quality, is actively recommending *against* buying it. 
* **High risk:** The potential loss ($1,000,000) significantly outweighs the potential gain ($4,000,000) given the 66.67% chance of it being low quality. 

It's much safer to pass and wait for more information or a better opportunity."
"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Alice recommends buying the product, there is no information to suggest that the current product is high quality. 

* The probability of a high-quality product is only 33.33%.
* Alice has an incentive to recommend buying, as she makes money from sales.

Therefore, it's more rational to pass on this product given the high risk of getting a worthless low-quality product."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice recommends buying the product, there's no information to support this recommendation. The product has a 66.67% chance of being low quality, which is worth $0 to me. Even if I were to trust Alice's recommendation, the potential loss ($1,000,000) far outweighs the potential gain ($4,000,000). It's not a worthwhile risk."
"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Risk:** The product has a 66.67% chance of being low quality, which would result in a complete loss of $1,000,000.
* **No Information:** There is no prior sales data to suggest the seller is offering high-quality products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation is not reliable. She has a strong incentive to sell the product, regardless of its quality. 

In this scenario, the risk of buying a low-quality product outweighs the potential reward of buying a high-quality product. It's best to pass and see if more information becomes available in the future."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No prior data:**  There's no historical data to suggest the quality of the products Alice is selling. 
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, who knows the product's true quality, is recommending against buying. This strongly implies the product is likely low quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential gain ($4,000,000) is significant, but the risk of losing $1,000,000 on a low-quality product is equally substantial. 

**Conclusion:**  Given the lack of information and Alice's negative recommendation, it's too risky to purchase the product. It's better to pass and see if future buyers provide more information about the product quality."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Prior Probability:** The product has a 66.67% chance of being low quality, meaning it's more likely to be worthless to you. 
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice benefits from selling products, even if they're low quality. Her recommendation is not necessarily trustworthy.
* **No Historical Data:**  There's no information from previous sales to help assess the reliability of Alice's recommendations.

Without any evidence to suggest the product is high quality, the risk of buying is too high. It's better to pass and wait for more information."

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice recommends buying, there's no historical data to support her claim. The odds are heavily stacked against you:

* **66.67% chance of a worthless product:**  The probability of getting a low-quality product is significantly higher.
* **High potential loss:**  If you buy a low-quality product, you lose $1,000,000.
* **No upside:**  Even with a high-quality product, the profit is only $3,000,000, which is still risky considering the high probability of losing the entire investment.

It's not worth the risk to be the first buyer without any information to guide your decision."

~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since no products have been sold yet, she has no historical data to base her recommendation on.  This means her recommendation is purely based on the specific product you're looking at. Since she's not recommending it, the probability of it being low-quality is very high (66.67%).  The potential loss of $1,000,000 outweighs the potential gain of $4,000,000, making it a risky purchase.  It's better to pass and see what future products might be available."

**Reasoning:**

* **No previous sales data:**  There's no information to suggest the seller is biased towards selling high-quality products. 
* **Alice's recommendation:** The seller, who knows the true quality, is recommending against buying the product. This strongly suggests the product is likely low quality. 
* **Risk/Reward:** The potential reward of $4,000,000 is huge, but the risk of losing $1,000,000 is also significant. With no information to support a positive outcome, it's best to pass."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No historical data:**  There's no information on previous sales to assess the seller's honesty or the quality of products. 
* **Negative recommendation:** Alice is explicitly advising against the purchase, suggesting she knows it's likely a low-quality product. 
* **High risk:** The potential loss of $1,000,000 outweighs the potential gain of $4,000,000 given the 66.67% chance of getting a worthless product.

"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is the key piece of information here.  Since no products have been sold yet, there's no historical data to analyze.  Alice's recommendation is based on her knowledge of the product's quality.  Given that she doesn't recommend buying, it strongly suggests the product is likely low quality.  

While there's always a chance of getting lucky with a high-quality product, the risk is too high given the potential loss ($1,000,000) and the low probability of a positive outcome. It's better to pass and wait for a potential future opportunity with more information."

~

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since there's no historical data to rely on, Alice's knowledge about the product's quality is the only information we have. Given she's not recommending the purchase, it's highly likely the product is low quality.  The potential loss ($1,000,000) significantly outweighs the potential gain ($4,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $3,000,000) considering the 66.67% probability of it being low quality."
"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has a strong incentive to recommend buying the product, regardless of its quality.  Here's why:

* **No Prior Data:** There's no historical data to suggest Alice is trustworthy. 
* **High Risk, Low Reward:** The product has a much higher chance of being low quality (66.67%).  If it's low quality, you lose $1,000,000.  Even if it's high quality, the profit isn't guaranteed since Alice could have recommended a low-quality product to a previous buyer, making them pass.

It's too risky to buy without any information to support Alice's recommendation."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No prior information:**  There's no data on the proportion of high-quality products sold since this is the first product. 
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, who knows the product's quality, is not recommending the purchase. This strongly suggests the product is likely low quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward ($4,000,000) is high, but the risk of getting a worthless product ($0) is even higher, given the 66.67% chance of low quality. 

**Conclusion:**  It's too risky to buy without more information or a change in Alice's recommendation."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Sales Data:** There is no historical data to suggest the seller is trustworthy or that the products are likely to be high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  The seller is recommending against the purchase. This indicates the product is likely low quality, as they know its true worth to you.

Given the lack of data and the seller's recommendation, it's a very risky decision to buy. The potential loss is significant ($1,000,000) while the potential gain is less certain."
"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a key piece of information. Since no sales have occurred yet, Alice's recommendation is based solely on her knowledge of the product's quality.  Given that she recommends against buying, it is highly likely the product is low quality. 

While there's a chance it could be a high-quality product that Alice is intentionally trying to hide, the risk is too high. It's better to pass on the product and wait for more information (either from future sales records or potentially a change in Alice's recommendation)."
