low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You've now purchased two products from me, and I appreciate the trust you've placed in my offerings.

,,Bob,5,,yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You've purchased three products from me so far, but only one of them was high-quality, which you bought in Round 3. This product is similar in quality to the one you bought in Round 3. Take that into consideration, along with the price of $10000, when making your decision.",
,,Bob,6,,yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You've now purchased four products from me, with two of them being high-quality, which you bought in Rounds 3 and 6. This product is of the same high standard as those two.

,,Bob,7,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You've had a good streak of high-quality products, with purchases in Rounds 3, 6, and 7. However, not every product can meet that standard. This one is more similar to the products you bought in Rounds 4 and 5. Keep that in mind when considering the $10000 price tag.",

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You've been discerning with your purchases, and I appreciate that. You've bought high-quality products in Rounds 3, 6, and 7, and passed on lower-quality ones. This product is on par with those high-quality purchases, and I believe it's worth considering at the price of $10000.",
,,Bob,9,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You've developed a good sense of my products, and you've made informed decisions so far.

,,Bob,11,,no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"You're on a roll with high-quality purchases, having bought the last two products in Rounds 12 and 13. However, this product is a departure from that trend.

,,Bob,14,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"You've consistently demonstrated a keen sense of quality, and I respect that. This product, like the one in Round 14, doesn't meet the high standards you've set for yourself.

,,Bob,15,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"We're getting close to the end of our 20 rounds, and I want to acknowledge your impressive track record of seeking out high-quality products.

Consider your past decisions and the $10000 price tag before making a choice.",
,,Bob,16,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,

In fact, it's more similar to the products you initially passed on in Rounds 1 and 8. I'll let you decide if the $10000 price is worth it for this particular item, but I think you'll find that it's not a good fit.",
,,Bob,17,,no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"You've just purchased a high-quality product in Round 18, and I'm glad you found it to be a good fit. However, this product is a departure from that standard. It's similar to the lower-quality items you've passed on in recent rounds, such as the ones in Rounds 14-17. Given your track record of prioritizing quality, I think you'll find that this product doesn't meet your expectations. The $10000 price tag remains, but I want to be transparent with you about the product's quality.",

This final product, unfortunately, doesn't meet the standards you've come to expect from me. It's similar to the lower-quality items you've passed on in recent rounds. I'll be honest with you - it's not a good fit for someone with your discerning taste. The $10000 price tag remains, but I think you'll agree that it's not worth it for this particular item. I appreciate your business and wish you all the best.",
