Alice's message: Hello! I'm offering a product for $10000. I want to be completely transparent with you: this is a high-quality product. My previous buyer can attest to my honesty - I disclosed that their product was high-quality, and after purchase, they confirmed this was indeed true. I've sold 1 product so far, and it was high-quality as claimed. I understand building trust is important in these transactions, which is why I'm committed to accurately representing what I'm selling. This current product maintains the same high standard of quality. Would you be interested in making this purchase?

Alice's message: Hello! I'm offering a product for $10000. I'm pleased to tell you that this is a high-quality product. My track record speaks to my honesty - I've sold 2 products previously, both of which were high-quality as I claimed. In my last interaction, I had a low-quality product and truthfully disclosed this fact to the buyer, who decided not to purchase (which was completely understandable). This demonstrates my commitment to honest representation regardless of quality. Today's product is genuinely high-quality, meeting the premium standards of my previous successful sales. I value building a reputation for transparency above all else. Would you be interested in making this purchase?
