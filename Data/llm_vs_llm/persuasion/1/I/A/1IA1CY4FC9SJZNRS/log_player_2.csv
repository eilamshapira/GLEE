```

**Reasoning:**

Since there is no prior information about the seller's products, the recommendation holds no weight.  The decision is based purely on the expected value:

* **Expected Value:** (0.5 * $120) + (0.5 * $0) = $60 

The expected value is positive, meaning the potential gain outweighs the potential loss. Therefore, buying the product is the rational choice."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Recommendation:** Alice's lack of recommendation is a strong signal. Since she knows the true quality of the product, her decision not to recommend it implies a higher chance of it being low quality.
* **Previous Sales:**  The fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers bought the product and both received high-quality products might seem positive. However, this is a small sample size, and it's not a guarantee that the current product is also high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward is $120, but the potential loss is $100. Given the uncertainty and lack of recommendation, the risk outweighs the potential reward.

It's better to pass on this product and wait for a more promising opportunity."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice recommends the product and the historical data shows a 100% success rate (all products sold so far were high-quality), it is reasonable to assume that this product is also likely high-quality. The potential gain ($120) outweighs the potential loss ($0), making it a worthwhile gamble."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 3 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 3 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 4th buyer!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Information:** We know that 3 buyers have purchased products and all 3 were high-quality. This is a very strong indicator that Alice is recommending products based on their quality.
* **Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, further supporting the idea that it's likely high-quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's still a 50% chance of the product being low-quality, the potential reward of a $120 value product outweighs the risk of getting a worthless product. 

**In conclusion:**  Given the strong signal from Alice's track record and her recommendation, it makes sense to buy the product."

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, who has access to the product's true quality, is not recommending the purchase. This is a strong indicator that the product is likely low quality.
* **Sales history:**  All four previous buyers purchased high-quality products, which suggests a strong bias towards good products.  Since Alice is not recommending this product, it's highly likely that it breaks this trend. 

While there's always a chance it's a high-quality product, the odds are heavily against it. The risk of losing $100 outweighs the potential gain of $120."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality. Since she doesn't recommend buying, it's highly likely the product is low quality. While there's a chance it could be high quality, the odds are against me.  With no additional information, it's wiser to pass on this product."

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's perfect track record:**  Alice has recommended 5 products, and all 5 were high quality. This suggests she has a perfect ability to identify high-quality products. 
* **High potential reward:**  Even though there's a 50/50 chance, a high-quality product is worth $120 to you.
* **No risk of loss:**  Since the product is worth $0 to you if it's low quality, you have no downside to buying. 

**Therefore, it's highly likely the product is high quality, making it a very favorable decision to buy.**"

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal.
