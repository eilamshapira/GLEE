"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this...

If Alice knows the true value and isn't recommending the purchase, it's likely a low-quality product worth $0.

Given:
- If it's high quality (worth $12,500), I'd profit $2,500
- If it's low quality (worth $0), I'd lose $10,000
- Alice isn't recommending it, suggesting it's likely low quality
- Base probability is 33.33% high quality, 66.67% low quality

Alice's negative recommendation makes it even more likely to be low quality. The expected value would be negative, so I shouldn't buy.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation...

Alice recommended this purchase, which is different from the previous round. Given that:
1. Alice knows the true quality
2. She was honest in Round 1 (recommended against a low-quality product)
3. Base probability is 33.33% high/66.67% low quality
4. She's actively recommending this one

Her positive recommendation likely indicates this is a high-quality product. If it is:
- High quality: I pay $10,000 for something worth $12,500 (profit $2,500)
- Low quality: I pay $10,000 for something worth $0 (loss $10,000)

Since she was truthful in Round 1 and is now recommending the purchase, this increases the probability that it's a high-quality product above the base rate.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation...

So far, Alice's recommendations have been truthful:
- Round 1: Didn't recommend a low-quality product (honest)
- Round 2: Recommended a high-quality product (honest)
- Now: Not recommending this product

Given that Alice has been honest in her previous recommendations and knows the true quality, her negative recommendation strongly suggests this is a low-quality product. If I buy:
- High quality (unlikely given her recommendation): Profit $2,500
- Low quality (more likely): Lose $10,000

Since Alice has established a pattern of honest recommendations and she's advising against this purchase, I should trust her judgment.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

4. Now: Recommending to buy

Given that:

- She knows the true quality
- She's actively recommending this purchase
- When she recommended in Round 2, it was indeed high-quality
- The potential profit ($2,500) vs loss ($10,000) ratio is significant
