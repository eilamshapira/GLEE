Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate this decision carefully.

Given information:
- The product costs $10,000
- 80% chance it's high quality (worth $12,000 to me)
- 20% chance it's low quality (worth $0 to me)
- Alice recommends buying the product
- No sales history yet

Expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 0.8 × $12,000 + 0.2 × $0 - $10,000 = $9,600 - $10,000 = -$400

While Alice recommends buying, the recommendation could be strategic rather than honest. With no sales history to evaluate Alice's reliability, and a negative expected value, I should decline.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation:

- The product costs $10,000
- High-quality product (80% chance) is worth $12,000 to me
- Low-quality product (20% chance) is worth $0 to me
- Alice recommends buying the product

The expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of getting $12,000 worth = $9,600
- 20% chance of getting $0 worth = $0
- Total expected value = $9,600

Since the expected value ($9,600) is less than the price ($10,000), and there's no sales history to evaluate Alice's recommendation reliability, it would be economically rational to decline.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to decide whether to buy the product based on the available information.

Given information:
- Each product has an 80% chance of being high quality and 20% chance of being low quality.
- A high-quality product is worth $12,000 to me, and a low-quality product is worth $0.
- The price is fixed at $10,000.
- Alice recommends that I buy the product.
- No products have been sold yet, so there's no track record to evaluate.

Expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 0.8 × ($12,000 - $10,000) + 0.2 × ($0 - $10,000) = $0.8 × $2,000 - $0.2 × $10,000 = $1,600 - $2,000 = -$400

Since the expected value is negative, it would not be rational to buy the product despite Alice's recommendation.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this offer carefully:

- Price: $10,000
- Potential value: $12,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice recommends buying the product
- No previous sales data available

My expected value calculation:
0.8 × $12,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $9,600

Since the expected value ($9,600) is less than the price ($10,000), it would not be rational to purchase based on prior probabilities alone.

Alice's recommendation might indicate she knows it's high quality, but without any track record of her truthfulness, I cannot rely on this recommendation.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this carefully.

The base probability of a high-quality product is 80%. A high-quality product gives me +$2,000 in value (worth $12,000 minus $10,000 cost), while a low-quality product gives me -$10,000 in value (worth $0 minus $10,000 cost).

Alice has told me she does NOT recommend buying this product. Since Alice knows the true quality, her recommendation suggests this is likely a low-quality product. If I trust her recommendation, I should decline.

The expected value calculation without Alice's recommendation would be:
0.8 × $2,000 + 0.2 × (-$10,000) = $1,600 - $2,000 = -$400

With Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of a low-quality product increases significantly, making the expected value even more negative.

The product costs $10,000.

Given the negative expected value and Alice's recommendation against buying, I should decline.
