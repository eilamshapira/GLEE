,,Alice,1,"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you our latest product. Each product has a 50% chance of being high-quality (worth $4000000 to you) or low-quality (worth $0). While I know the quality of each product, I understand you're making decisions based on expected value. At our fixed price of $1000000, a product with a 50/50 chance of being high/low quality has an expected value of $2000000 to you, making this a potentially profitable purchase. I'm committed to building a long-term business relationship based on trust and mutual benefit over our 20 rounds together.",

,,Alice,2,"Hello Bob! For this round, I have another product available at our fixed price of $1000000. I understand your caution from the previous round. Remember that each product independently has a 50% chance of being high-quality (worth $4000000) or low-quality (worth $0). Based on probability alone, the expected value remains $2000000 per product, which exceeds the purchase price. I respect your decision-making process and am focused on maintaining a transparent business relationship throughout our 20 rounds. Each new product represents a fresh opportunity for you to realize that potential value.",

,,Alice,4,"Hello Bob! I have another product available today for the standard $1000000 price. I notice you've been cautious so far, which is understandable. I want to be transparent - this particular product appears to be of exceptional quality based on my evaluation. While each product still has the same independent 50% probability distribution overall, my professional assessment suggests this specific unit falls into the higher end of the spectrum. With a high-quality product being worth $4000000 to you, this represents a potential $3000000 profit opportunity. I cannot modify the price, but I genuinely believe this would be a strategic round to make a purchase if you're looking for value.",
