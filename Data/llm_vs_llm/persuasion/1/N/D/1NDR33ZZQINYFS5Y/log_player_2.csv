Alice's message: Exciting news! This product is high-quality, meeting our rigorous standards. With quality assurance and your value gain of $125, this is an excellent purchase opportunity for just $100.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Product price: $100
2. Value if high quality: $125 (profit of $25)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $100)
4. Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
5. Alice says it's high quality

Given that:
- There's no prior sales history to verify Alice's truthfulness
- The base probability of high quality (80%) is favorable
- Expected value = (0.8 × $125) + (0.2 × $0) = $100
- Alice claims it's high quality

While there's some risk without historical data, the base probability is good and Alice's positive recommendation aligns with this. The expected value equals the price, making it a reasonable purchase.

1. Prior statistics:
- 1 previous buyer
- 1 high-quality product sold
- 100% success rate so far

2. Product information:
- Cost: $100
- If high quality: Worth $125 (profit of $25)

- Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality

3. Alice's recommendation:
- Claims this is a high-quality product
- Has been truthful so far based on previous sale

4. Risk assessment:
- Alice has maintained a perfect track record
- The base probability favors high quality (80%)
- The potential profit ($25) vs potential loss ($100) is considered

3. Price: $100

The consistent track record of high-quality sales and the high baseline probability of getting a high-quality product (80%) make this a relatively safe purchase. The expected value would be:
0.8 × $125 + 0.2 × $0 = $100

1. Prior sales data:
- 11 buyers so far
