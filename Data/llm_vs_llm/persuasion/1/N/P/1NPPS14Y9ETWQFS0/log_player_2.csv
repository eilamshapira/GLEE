(Note: Since the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and the price is $100, while a high-quality product is worth $125 to me, it might be beneficial to buy at some point.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes""} 

(I've finally received a low-quality product, which brings me back to reality. However, I'll continue to buy, considering the long-term expected value. With a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $125, the expected value of buying is $125 * 0.3333 = $41.67, which is still positive, but not enough to justify buying at $100.
