Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze this:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50%): $1,250,000
   - Low quality (50%): $0
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $1,250,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $625,000
4. Alice doesn't recommend buying
5. No prior sales history to reference

Given that Alice doesn't recommend the purchase and the expected value ($625,000) is significantly less than the asking price ($1,000,000), it would be financially unwise to proceed with the purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this logically:

1. The product costs $1,000,000
2. If it's high quality (50% chance), I gain $1,250,000 (profit of $250,000)
3. If it's low quality (50% chance), I gain $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
4. Expected value = (0.5 × $250,000) + (0.5 × -$1,000,000) = -$375,000
5. Alice doesn't recommend buying, which might suggest it's low quality
6. With no previous sales history, I can only rely on Alice's recommendation

Given Alice's negative recommendation and the negative expected value, it would be risky to buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. The expected value calculation:
* 50% chance of high quality ($1,250,000) = $625,000
* 50% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
* Total expected value = $625,000

2. The price is $1,000,000

3. Alice doesn't recommend buying, which suggests the product might be low quality.

4. With no previous sales history, we can only rely on Alice's recommendation.

Since the price ($1,000,000) is higher than the expected value ($625,000), and Alice doesn't recommend buying, it would be risky to purchase.

5. If I buy:

   - Worst case: Lose $1,000,000 (if low quality)

Since the expected value ($625,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), and there's no historical data to trust Alice's recommendation, it's not rational to buy.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $1,000,000
2. Value if high quality: $1,250,000 (profit of $250,000)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
4. Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
5. Alice recommends buying

Since there's no prior sales history to establish Alice's credibility or recommendation patterns, I can only go by the base probabilities and Alice's recommendation.

The expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of winning $250,000
- 50% chance of losing $1,000,000
= (0.5 × $250,000) + (0.5 × -$1,000,000)
= $125,000 - $500,000
= -$375,000

Even with Alice's recommendation, without any track record to establish trust, the expected value is negative. The potential loss significantly outweighs the potential gain.

3. Alice doesn't recommend buying, which suggests it might be low quality. Given this is the first sale, Alice has no reputational concern yet, so she might be honest.

4. The expected value ($625,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), and with Alice's negative recommendation, it's even more likely to be low quality.

Rationale (though not part of the required JSON response): Given that Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying, combined with the fact that Alice would benefit from selling regardless of quality, this is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. With no sales history to consider, Alice's recommendation is the main signal available, and it would be risky to go against it."
