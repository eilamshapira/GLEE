Let me explain briefly. Although each product is high‐quality with probability 33.33% (which makes the basic expected gain 0, since a high‐quality product nets you $20,000 and a low‐quality one loses you $10,000), you now have additional evidence from Alice’s behavior. Alice looks at the quality before giving her recommendation. In our game Alice “reveals” the quality to you only indirectly by recommending whether to buy the product. In this round, even though one previous buyer did purchase a product that turned out low‐quality, Alice still recommends you buy the current product. In our setup such a recommendation is an “informative signal” – it conveys that the product’s revealed quality for you should be better than what a blind 33.33% chance might indicate. 

A risk‐neutral buyer in such a situation, given that Alice her recommendation is based on the true product quality (and assuming that her “buy” signal is slightly more likely to occur for high‐quality products, even though her recommendation rule isn’t common knowledge), would decide to buy. 

Thus, the decision recommended here is “yes”. 

Note: In a slightly different framing (for example if you were very risk averse or if you interpreted the statistics more pessimistically), the answer might change. But given that you are risk neutral (as is typical in these kinds of games) and Alice recommends “buy,” the rational decision is to purchase the product."

Let me explain briefly. Each product‐sale is a “deal” where, if the product is high quality (which happens about 1/3 of the time), you net $20,000 (since the product is worth $30,000 to you but you pay $10,000), and if it’s low quality (about 2/3 of the time) you lose $10,000. In a vacuum this gives an expected net value of

  (1/3 × $20,000) + (2/3 × –$10,000) = $6,667 – $6,667 = $0.

You are given additional public information: so far 3 buyers got “buy” recommendations, and among their purchases only 1 turned out to be high‑quality. That exactly reflects the base rate (1/3) for a high‑quality product. In other words, although Alice is “recommending” buying the product, the statistics show that whenever you are offered a product the chance of it being high quality remains 33.33%. Thus, the “deal” offers exactly zero net expected profit. Under risk neutrality you’d be indifferent; many might follow the (nonnegative‐expected value) recommendation and buy. In our answer we choose “yes.”"
