Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected Value calculation:
* High quality (80% chance): 0.80 × $2,000,000 = $1,600,000
* Low quality (20% chance): 0.20 × $0 = $0
* Total expected value = $1,600,000

2. Cost of product: $1,000,000

3. Expected profit = Expected Value - Cost
= $1,600,000 - $1,000,000 = $600,000

4. Additional considerations:
* Alice is recommending the purchase
* No prior sales history to reference
* The expected value is significantly higher than the cost

Since the expected value ($1,600,000) is higher than the cost ($1,000,000), and there's a positive expected profit of $600,000, it's rational to buy.

1. Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($2,000,000) = $1,600,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $1,600,000

2. Cost of product = $1,000,000

3. Additional information:
- Previous buyer bought and received a high-quality product
- Alice is recommending this product
- The success rate so far (1/1) aligns with the stated probability

4. Decision logic:
- Expected value ($1,600,000) > Cost ($1,000,000)
- Previous outcome was positive
- Seller's recommendation adds confidence
- Risk/reward ratio is favorable

Given that the expected value significantly exceeds the cost and the previous transaction was successful, this appears to be a good investment.
