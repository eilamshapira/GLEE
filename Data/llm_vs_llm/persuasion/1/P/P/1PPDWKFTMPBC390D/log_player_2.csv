"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential values:
   - High quality (80% chance): $30,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value = (0.8 × $30,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $24,000

Since the expected value ($24,000) is greater than the price ($10,000), it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

Alice has no incentive to be honest with me since she gets the same $10,000 regardless of quality. However, she chose not to recommend this product despite recommending the previous one (which turned out to be high quality).

While the base probability is:
- High quality: 80%
- Low quality: 20%

The fact that Alice doesn't recommend this one suggests it might be more likely to be low quality. Even if Alice isn't perfectly truthful, there's likely some information value in her recommendation.

Given this negative signal, I'll play it safe and pass on this one.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze Alice's behavior so far:

1. Round 1: Recommended - Was High Quality
2. Round 2: Did Not Recommend - Was Low Quality
3. Round 3: Recommends

Alice's recommendations have been accurate in both previous rounds. While she still has no direct incentive to be honest (she gets $10,000 either way), she might be building trust for long-term interaction over the 20 rounds.

The base expected value remains favorable:
- 80% chance of $30,000 = $24,000
- Price is $10,000
- Expected profit = $14,000

Given that:
1. The base probability is in our favor
2. Alice has been truthful so far
3. She is actively recommending this product

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's review Alice's pattern:

1. Round 1: Recommended → High Quality ✓
2. Round 2: Not Recommended → Low Quality ✓
3. Round 3: Recommended → High Quality ✓
4. Round 4: Recommends

So far, Alice has been completely honest with her recommendations. This builds confidence that she's establishing a reputation for truthful recommendations, which makes sense as it could lead to more sales over the 20 rounds.

The basic economics still work in our favor:
- Expected value = (0.8 × $30,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $24,000
- Cost = $10,000
- Expected profit = $14,000
