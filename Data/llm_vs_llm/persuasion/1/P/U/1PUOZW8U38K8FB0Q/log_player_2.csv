Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The price is $10,000
2. If high quality, I gain $30,000 (profit of $20,000)
3. If low quality, I gain $0 (loss of $10,000)
4. Alice doesn't recommend buying
5. Alice knows the true value
6. Alice seems to have no incentive to lie

Given that Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If I buy a low-quality product, I would lose $10,000.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - 50% chance of $30,000 (high quality)
   - 50% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value: (50% × $30,000) + (50% × $0) = $15,000
4. Alice recommends buying
5. No prior sales history to evaluate Alice's truthfulness

Even without knowing Alice's trustworthiness, the expected value ($15,000) is higher than the price ($10,000), making this a positive expected value decision. Given Alice's recommendation and the favorable expected value, I'll take the risk.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Previous statistics:
- 1 buyer before me
- 1 product sold
- 1 high-quality product sold (100% success rate so far)

2. Current situation:
- Price is $10,000
- 50% chance of high quality ($30,000 value)
- 50% chance of low quality ($0 value)
- Alice doesn't recommend buying

The key factor here is that Alice explicitly doesn't recommend buying. Given that:
1. Alice knows the true quality
2. She has shown honesty by selling a high-quality product before
3. She's actively advising against purchase

This strongly suggests the product is low quality. If I buy, I would likely get a $0 value product for $10,000.

1. Previous statistics:

- 1 high-quality product sold
- This shows Alice has been honest so far

2. Current situation:
- Alice is not recommending the product
- Given her honest track record and that she knows the true quality
- Her negative recommendation likely means this is a low-quality product

3. Risk assessment:
- Price: $10,000
- If high quality: gain $20,000 ($30,000 - $10,000)
- If low quality: lose $10,000 ($0 - $10,000)
- Alice's negative recommendation makes low quality more likely

Given Alice's honest track record and her current negative recommendation, it's most likely a low-quality product that would result in a loss.

   - 100% success rate
4. Alice is recommending to buy

Alice's perfect track record and positive recommendation are strong positive signals. Previous buyers who followed her recommendation received high-quality products. This suggests Alice is being honest in her recommendations.

Expected value calculation:
- If Alice is truthful (which seems likely given the track record), this is a high-quality product
- A high-quality product would give me $20,000 profit ($30,000 - $10,000)

Given the strong track record and positive recommendation, this appears to be a good deal.
