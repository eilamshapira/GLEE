"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. Base probability:
- High quality: 33.33% (worth $40,000)
- Low quality: 66.67% (worth $0)

2. Alice doesn't recommend buying:
- This likely means it's a low-quality product
- Alice has no direct incentive to lie since the price is fixed
- Her recommendation provides additional negative signal

3. Expected value calculation:
- Given the negative recommendation, the probability of high quality is likely even lower than 33.33%
- Even at base probability: (0.3333 × $40,000 + 0.6667 × $0) = $13,332
- With negative recommendation, expected value is likely below $10,000

4. Decision:
Since Alice has no reason to lie and actively recommends against buying, the expected value is very likely below the $10,000 price.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. Previous round:
- Alice was honest in her negative recommendation
- This builds some trust in her recommendations

2. Current situation:
- Alice recommends buying
- Base probability was 33.33% high / 66.67% low
- But with a positive recommendation, probability of high quality should increase

3. Expected value calculation:
- Given Alice's proven honesty and positive recommendation
- Probability of high quality likely higher than base 33.33%
- If we assume probability of high quality is now >25%:
- Expected value = (>0.25 × $40,000) = >$10,000

4. Decision:
Since Alice proved honest last round and now recommends buying, the expected value likely exceeds the $10,000 price.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

4. Decision:
Alice has demonstrated honest recommendations twice now, and she's advising against purchase. Following her proven track record is logical.
