"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has revealed the true quality of the product and is not recommending I buy it. Given that:
- A high-quality product is worth $125 to me (profiting $25)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (losing $100)
- Products are 50% likely to be high or low quality

If Alice is being truthful about her recommendation, she's suggesting this product is low quality. Since buying a low-quality product would result in a $100 loss, I should decline.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice again does not recommend that I buy the product. In the previous round, her recommendation was honest - she didn't recommend a low-quality product.

Since:
- A high-quality product would give me $25 profit
- A low-quality product would give me $100 loss
- Alice's recommendation appears truthful based on round 1

I'll follow her recommendation and not buy the product.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has not recommended the product for the third time. In both previous rounds, her recommendations were honest - she didn't recommend low-quality products that would have caused me to lose $100.

Since her recommendations have been consistently truthful so far, I'll continue to follow her advice and not buy this product.

{""decision"": ""no""}"

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is the first time Alice has recommended that I buy a product. In all three previous rounds, Alice did not recommend buying, and all three products were indeed low quality. Her recommendations have been honest so far.

Now that she's recommending I buy this product, it's likely that this is a high-quality product worth $125 to me. Buying it for $100 would give me a $25 profit.

Based on Alice's track record of honesty so far, I'll follow her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"

Given her consistent track record of truthfulness, I'll follow her recommendation again and buy this product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!

- When she recommended (rounds 4-5), the products were high quality

Since her advice has been reliable and she's not recommending this product, it's likely low quality which would result in a $100 loss for me.

I'll continue to trust her recommendation.
