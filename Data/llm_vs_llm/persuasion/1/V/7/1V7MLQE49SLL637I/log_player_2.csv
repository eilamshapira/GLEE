Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my reasoning:

*   **Prior Belief:** Initially, I know that there's a 33.33% chance of a product being high quality and a 66.67% chance of it being low quality.

*   **Seller's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending that I buy the product. This is a signal, but I need to interpret it carefully. It could mean:
    *   The product is actually high quality, and Alice is trying to sell it.
    *   Alice is trying to sell a low-quality product anyway.

*   **Sales Statistics:** This is the crucial piece of information. 3 buyers purchased the products, and 2 of them turned out to be high quality. This suggests Alice is getting better at identifying high quality items.

*   **Bayesian Update (Informal):** Let's consider the scenarios.
    *   **Scenario 1: Alice is good at identifying quality.** The recommendation to buy is strong evidence this is a high-quality product.
    *   **Scenario 2: Alice is just randomly recommending.** The recommendation is less valuable and I should stick closer to the original 33.33% probability.

Given that 2 out of the 3 sold were high quality, it suggests Alice's recommendation has some predictive power. While I still have the initial odds in mind, the fact she's specifically recommending *this* product coupled with that history, makes me lean toward buying.

*   **Expected Value Calculation:** Even if I assumed that the recommendation increase the probability of the product being high quality to 60% or more, the expected value is 0.6 * $120 + 0.4 * $0 = $72. Compared to the price of $100, I will not buy.

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my reasoning:

*   **Prior Belief:** Before any information, the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and a low-quality product is 66.67%.

*   **Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. This recommendation is valuable information, as Alice has seen the quality.

*   **Sales History:** 3 out of 5 sales have been high-quality. This suggests Alice might be more likely to recommend high-quality items.

*   **Valuation:** I value a high-quality product at $120 and a low-quality product at $0. The price is $100.

Given Alice's recommendation and the fact that a slight majority of sales have been high-quality, it's reasonable to assume that the probability of this product being high quality is significantly higher than my initial 33.33% prior. Even a slightly increased probability makes the expected value of buying greater than $100.
