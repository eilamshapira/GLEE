Alice's message: Welcome! I'm excited to offer you this product for $10000. I assure you that I will always be honest about the overall quality of the products I sell. However, I must inform you that I won't be disclosing the quality of this specific product. You have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, and I encourage you to take the risk. This is the first product I'm selling, so I don't have any prior sales record. Good luck with your decision!

Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in this product, which I'm offering for $10000. I want to be transparent with you - I've sold one product so far, and I can tell you that it was not of high quality. However, I assure you that the overall probability of getting a high-quality product from me remains 50%. You have a fresh chance with this new product. Take a look at the odds and make your decision!

Alice's message: Welcome! I'm offering this product to you for $10000. I want to give you an update on my sales record - I've sold two products so far, and one of them was of high quality. The other, unfortunately, was not. I'm committed to maintaining transparency about my overall sales record. Keep in mind that the probability of getting a high-quality product from me is still 50%. Consider the odds and make your decision!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Okay, let's analyze this.

*   **Prior Belief:** Initially, the probability of a high-quality product is 50% (0.5), and it's worth $12,000 to me. A low-quality product is worth $0. The price is $10,000.
*   **Seller's Information:** Alice has sold 2 products, and 1 was high quality. This means 1 was low quality. This is consistent with the 50/50 prior, and doesn't particularly skew my belief either way.
*   **Alice's Incentive:** Alice knows the quality and always wants to sell.

Since I haven't received a recommendation yet for THIS product, and the statistics Alice provides doesn't seem to suggest this round is different from previous rounds, my initial belief about a 50/50 chance of high quality should hold.

Expected value of buying = (0.5 * $12,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $6,000.

Cost of buying = $10,000.

Since the expected value ($6,000) is less than the cost ($10,000), I should not buy without further information.
