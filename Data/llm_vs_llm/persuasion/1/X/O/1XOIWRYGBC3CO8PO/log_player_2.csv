"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this decision.

From the game description, I know:
- Each product has an 80% chance of being high quality
- High-quality products are worth $4,000,000 to me
- Low-quality products are worth $0 to me
- The price is always $1,000,000

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of getting $4,000,000 value for $1,000,000 = +$3,000,000 in expected profit
- 20% chance of getting $0 value for $1,000,000 = -$1,000,000 in expected loss
- Total expected value: (0.8 × $3,000,000) + (0.2 × -$1,000,000) = $2,400,000 - $200,000 = $2,200,000

Since the expected value is positive and significantly higher than the cost, it makes sense to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this decision.

Alice is not recommending this product, which is different from the previous rounds. This could be because she knows it's low quality. However, I need to consider the base probabilities:

- Each product still has an 80% chance of being high quality
- High-quality products are worth $4,000,000 to me
- Low-quality products are worth $0 to me
- The price is always $1,000,000

Without any additional information about Alice's recommendation strategy, the expected value calculation would still be:
- 80% chance of getting $4,000,000 value for $1,000,000 = +$3,000,000 in expected profit
- 20% chance of getting $0 value for $1,000,000 = -$1,000,000 in expected loss
- Total expected value: $2,200,000

However, Alice's negative recommendation likely means the probability of this being high quality is much lower than 80%. If she's being honest, this product is likely low quality.
