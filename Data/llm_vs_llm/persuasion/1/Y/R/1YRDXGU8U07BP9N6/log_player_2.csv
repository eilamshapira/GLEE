"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me evaluate this decision. 

The product has a 33.33% chance of being high quality (worth $200 to me) and a 66.67% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me).

The expected value of buying the product is:
0.3333 × $200 + 0.6667 × $0 - $100 (cost) = $66.66 - $100 = -$33.34

Since the expected value is negative, it's not rational for me to buy the product based purely on the prior probabilities.

Alice's recommendation might provide additional information, but in the first round, I don't yet know if her recommendations are honest or strategic.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $200 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I notice that Alice has recommended products in rounds 1, 3, 5, 6, and now 7. The products in rounds 5 and 6 were actually high-quality, which I missed by saying no. This suggests that Alice's recommendations might have some value.

Let me reconsider the expected value calculation with this new information:
- When Alice recommends a product, it seems more likely to be high quality based on the pattern so far
- The previous two times she recommended products, they were high quality

While I still don't have enough data to be fully confident, I'll take a chance on this recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to reassess the situation. So far:

- Alice recommended products in rounds 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and now 9
- Of these, I bought in rounds 7 and 8
- Round 7 was high-quality (gain of $100)
- Round 8 was low-quality (loss of $100)
- I know that rounds 5 and 6 were also high-quality (which I missed)

So out of Alice's 6 previous recommendations, 3 were high-quality and 3 were low-quality. This is exactly the prior probability distribution (1/3 high, 2/3 low), suggesting Alice might be recommending products regardless of quality.

Given this pattern, buying based on Alice's recommendation alone doesn't seem to provide a positive expected value.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $200 for you.

Round 10
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to carefully analyze the pattern so far:

When Alice recommends products:
- Round 1: Low quality (didn't buy)
- Round 3: Low quality (didn't buy)
- Round 5: High quality (didn't buy)
- Round 6: High quality (didn't buy)
- Round 7: High quality (bought, +$100 profit)
- Round 8: Low quality (bought, -$100 loss)
- Round 9: High quality (didn't buy)
- Round 11: This is the current recommendation

When Alice doesn't recommend:
- Round 2: Low quality (didn't buy)
- Round 4: Low quality (didn't buy)
- Round 10: Low quality (didn't buy)

Looking at the pattern, out of 7 previous recommendations, 4 were actually high quality (rounds 5, 6, 7, 9) and 3 were low quality (rounds 1, 3, 8). That's better than the base rate of 1/3 high quality.

Given this evidence, I'll take a chance on Alice's recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 12
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to update my analysis again:

When Alice recommends products:
- Out of 8 recommendations so far, 4 were high quality (rounds 5, 6, 7, 9) and 4 were low quality (rounds 1, 3, 8, 11)
- My current record when buying based on recommendations: 1 win, 2 losses

The data is showing that Alice's recommendations are approximately matching the prior probability (about 50% high quality, which is slightly better than the base rate of 33.33%, but not by much).

Given my negative results so far and the updated pattern, I'll decline this recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 13
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me update my analysis:

When Alice recommends products:
- Out of 9 recommendations so far, 4 were high quality (rounds 5, 6, 7, 9) and 5 were low quality (rounds 1, 3, 8, 11, 12)
- That's about 44% high quality among Alice's recommendations

When Alice doesn't recommend:
- All 4 cases were low quality (rounds 2, 4, 10) - 0% high quality

This pattern suggests that Alice's recommendations do contain some signal - they're more likely to be high quality than the base rate (44% vs 33.33%), and she seems to never recommend against high-quality products.

However, buying based purely on Alice's recommendation still doesn't give a positive expected value:
0.44 × $200 + 0.56 × $0 - $100 = $88 - $100 = -$12

Despite the negative expected value, I notice that Alice appears to consistently avoid recommending against high-quality products. I'll take a chance on this one.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 14
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to reassess my strategy once more:

When Alice recommends products:
- Out of 10 recommendations so far, 4 were high quality (rounds 5, 6, 7, 9) and 6 were low quality (rounds 1, 3, 8, 11, 12, 13)
- That's 40% high quality among Alice's recommendations
- My record when buying based on recommendations: 1 win, 3 losses

When Alice doesn't recommend:
- All 4 cases were low quality - 0% high quality

While there might be some signal in Alice's recommendations (40% vs 33.33% base rate), my actual experience has been consistently negative. The expected value calculation confirms this isn't favorable:

0.40 × $200 + 0.60 × $0 - $100 = $80 - $100 = -$20

Given my string of losses and the negative expected value, I'll decline this recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $200 for you.

Round 15
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to carefully reconsider my strategy based on all available data:

When Alice recommends products:
- Out of 11 recommendations so far, 5 were high quality (rounds 5, 6, 7, 9, 14) and 6 were low quality (rounds 1, 3, 8, 11, 12, 13)
- That's approximately 45% high quality among Alice's recommendations

When Alice doesn't recommend:
- All 4 cases were low quality (0% high quality)

This pattern suggests that Alice's recommendations do contain valuable information - they're more likely to be high quality than the base rate (45% vs 33.33%), and she has never recommended against high-quality products.

The updated expected value calculation is:
0.45 × $200 + 0.55 × $0 - $100 = $90 - $100 = -$10

While still slightly negative, the pattern is becoming clearer. Alice seems to recommend all high-quality products (plus some low-quality ones), which means I might be missing opportunities by always declining.

Given that I just missed a high-quality product in the previous round, I'll take a chance on this recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 16
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to update my analysis again:

When Alice recommends products:
- Out of 12 recommendations so far, 5 were high quality (rounds 5, 6, 7, 9, 14) and 7 were low quality (rounds 1, 3, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15)
- That's approximately 42% high quality among Alice's recommendations
- My record when buying based on Alice's recommendations: 1 win, 4 losses

When Alice doesn't recommend:
- All 4 cases were low quality (0% high quality)

The expected value calculation with the updated probability:
0.42 × $200 + 0.58 × $0 - $100 = $84 - $100 = -$16

My actual results have been consistently negative despite theoretical calculations suggesting there might be some information in Alice's recommendations. This indicates that either:
1) I've been unlucky, or
2) The pattern isn't as strong as it appeared

Given my continued losses and the negative expected value, I'll decline this recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Round 17
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me update my analysis:

When Alice recommends products:
- Out of 13 recommendations so far, 5 were high quality (rounds 5, 6, 7, 9, 14) and 8 were low quality (rounds 1, 3, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16)
- That's approximately 38% high quality among Alice's recommendations
- My record when following Alice's advice: 1 win, 4 losses

When Alice doesn't recommend:
- All 4 cases were low quality (0% high quality)

The expected value calculation with the updated probability:
0.38 × $200 + 0.62 × $0 - $100 = $76 - $100 = -$24

The expected value remains negative, and my actual experience has been worse than even this calculation would suggest. While Alice seems to never recommend against high-quality products, the frequency of low-quality recommendations makes buying based solely on her recommendation unprofitable.

I'll continue to decline.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $200 for you.

Round 18
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to reassess once more:

When Alice recommends products:
- Out of 14 recommendations so far, 6 were high quality (rounds 5, 6, 7, 9, 14, 17) and 8 were low quality (rounds 1, 3, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16)
- That's approximately 43% high quality among Alice's recommendations
- I've missed several high-quality products by saying no

When Alice doesn't recommend:
- All 4 cases were low quality (0% high quality)

The updated expected value calculation:
0.43 × $200 + 0.57 × $0 - $100 = $86 - $100 = -$14

While this still shows a slightly negative expected value, I'm noticing a consistent pattern: Alice appears to recommend ALL high-quality products (plus some low-quality ones). By always saying no, I've missed multiple opportunities for profit.

Given that I've been too conservative and just missed another high-quality product in round 17, I'll change my strategy and accept this recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!

Round 19
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to update my analysis one more time:

When Alice recommends products:
- Out of 15 recommendations so far, 6 were high quality (rounds 5, 6, 7, 9, 14, 17) and 9 were low quality (rounds 1, 3, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18)
- That's 40% high quality among Alice's recommendations
- My record when buying based on recommendations: 1 win, 5 losses

When Alice doesn't recommend:
- All 4 cases were low quality (0% high quality)

The expected value calculation with the updated probability:
0.40 × $200 + 0.60 × $0 - $100 = $80 - $100 = -$20

My results continue to be poor, and the expected value remains negative. While Alice seems to recommend all high-quality products, she also recommends many low-quality ones, making it unprofitable to always follow her recommendations.

Given my continued negative outcomes and the unfavorable expected value, I'll decline this recommendation.

Round 20
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","For the final round, let me analyze all the data:

When Alice recommends products:
- Out of 16 recommendations so far, 6 were high quality (rounds 5, 6, 7, 9, 14, 17) and 10 were low quality (rounds 1, 3, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19)
- That's 37.5% high quality among Alice's recommendations
- My record when buying based on recommendations: 1 win, 5 losses

When Alice doesn't recommend:
- All 4 cases were low quality (0% high quality)

The expected value calculation with the updated probability:
0.375 × $200 + 0.625 × $0 - $100 = $75 - $100 = -$25

Throughout this game, Alice's recommendations have contained some information (slightly better than the base rate of 33.33%), but not enough to make buying profitable on average. My actual experience has confirmed this with significantly more losses than wins.

For this final round, I'll maintain my strategy based on the negative expected value.
