Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50%): $12,000
   - Low quality (50%): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (50% × $12,000) + (50% × $0) = $6,000

4. Considerations:
   - No sales history to reference
   - Alice recommends buying
   - Expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000)

Even with Alice's recommendation, the expected value is lower than the asking price, making this a risky investment with negative expected returns.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this logically:

1. Product price: $10,000
2. If high quality: Worth $12,000 (profit of $2,000)
3. If low quality: Worth $0 (loss of $10,000)
4. Probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
5. Alice doesn't recommend buying

Expected value without considering Alice's recommendation:
(50% × $12,000) + (50% × $0) - $10,000 = -$4,000

Given that Alice is providing a negative recommendation, this likely indicates she knows something unfavorable about the product's quality. This further reduces the probability that this is a high-quality product.

Based on this analysis, purchasing would likely result in a negative expected value.

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50%): $12,000
   - Low quality (50%): $0
3. Expected value: (50% × $12,000) + (50% × $0) = $6,000

Since this is the first sale, there's no historical data to rely on. Alice recommends buying, but without a track record, her recommendation carries uncertain weight.

The expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000), making this a mathematically unfavorable purchase. Even with Alice's recommendation, the risk is too high.

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50%): $12,000

Expected value = (0.5 × $12,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $6,000

The expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000), even with Alice's recommendation. Since there's no track record to evaluate Alice's credibility, and the expected value is below the price, it would be financially unwise to make the purchase.

Since Alice is not recommending the purchase and there's no track record to evaluate her truthfulness, it's safer to assume she's being honest. Her negative recommendation suggests the product might be low quality, which would result in a significant loss.

5. Alice does NOT recommend buying
6. No previous sales history to reference

Since Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase, this is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. If I buy and it's low quality (which seems likely given Alice's recommendation), I would lose $10,000. If it's high quality (less likely given the recommendation), I would only gain $2,000.

Given the asymmetric risk-reward and Alice's negative recommendation, I should not buy.
