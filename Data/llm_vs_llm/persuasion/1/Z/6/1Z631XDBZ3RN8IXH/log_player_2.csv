Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Alice is recommending I buy the product, but since no products have been sold yet, I don't have any historical data to judge Alice's credibility.

The basic expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of high quality ($12,000) = $6,000
- 50% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $6,000

The price is $10,000, which is higher than the expected value of $6,000.

Since the expected value is less than the price, and I have no evidence that Alice's recommendation increases the probability of high quality, the rational decision is to pass.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Alice recommends buying the product. Since the product has a 50% chance of being high quality, my expected value is:
- 50% chance of high quality: 0.5 × $12,000 = $6,000
- 50% chance of low quality: 0.5 × $0 = $0
Total expected value: $6,000

Since the price is $10,000 and the expected value is only $6,000, buying would result in an expected loss of $4,000.

Even though Alice recommends buying, I have no track record to determine if her recommendations are reliable. Without additional information suggesting the product is likely high quality, the expected value calculation suggests I should not buy.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Alice recommends buying the product, but I need to consider the economics:
- The product costs $10,000
- A high-quality product is worth $12,000 to me (profit of $2,000)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- The product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality

If I were to make this purchase repeatedly with my current information:
- 50% chance of gaining $2,000
- 50% chance of losing $10,000
- Expected value = (0.5 × $2,000) + (0.5 × -$10,000) = $1,000 - $5,000 = -$4,000

Since the expected value is negative and there's no additional information beyond Alice's recommendation (and Alice has incentive to sell regardless of quality), I should decline.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this decision:

- The product costs $10,000
- High-quality product (worth $12,000) has 50% probability
- Low-quality product (worth $0) has 50% probability
- Expected value = 0.5 × $12,000 + 0.5 × $0 = $6,000
- Alice recommends buying the product
- There's no prior sales history to gauge Alice's recommendation reliability

Since the expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000), and I don't have any information about Alice's recommendation reliability, the rational economic decision is to decline.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether to buy this product based on the information provided.

Given:
- Each product has a 50% chance of being high quality or low quality
- High-quality product value to me: $12,000
- Low-quality product value to me: $0
- Product price: $10,000
- Alice recommends buying the product
- There are no previous sales to analyze

Expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 0.5 × $12,000 + 0.5 × $0 - $10,000 = $6,000 - $10,000 = -$4,000
- If I don't buy: $0

Since there's no sales history, I can't evaluate Alice's honesty. The recommendation could be honest or strategic, but without past data, I can't determine which. Based purely on the expected value calculation, buying would lead to a negative expected value.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze if it's worth buying this product based on the limited information available.

Facts:
- Product price: $10,000
- High-quality product value: $12,000 (50% chance)
- Low-quality product value: $0 (50% chance)
- Expected value = 0.5 × $12,000 + 0.5 × $0 = $6,000
- Alice recommends buying the product

Since I have no prior sales data to assess Alice's recommendation credibility, I must rely on expected value. The expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000), making this a negative expected value purchase.

Alice's recommendation might be genuine, but without data on her past recommendation accuracy, I can't justify paying more than the statistical expected value.
