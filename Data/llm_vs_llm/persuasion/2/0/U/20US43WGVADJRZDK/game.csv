,,Alice,2,"This product is one of our best, and I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm confident it's worth every penny of the $100 price tag.",
,,Bob,2,,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I want to be upfront with you, I've had two products that didn't sell so far, and I'm eager to make a sale. This one is particularly good, and I think you'll find it's a great investment at $100.",
,,Bob,3,,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Three out of the first four products I've offered are exceptionally good, and this one is no exception. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100.",
,,Bob,4,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"To be honest, I've had a tough time selling my products so far, and I'm starting to think that maybe I'm overpricing them or not conveying their value correctly. This one is a good product, but I want to make it clear that it's not one of my best. Still, it might be worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let you decide.",
,,Bob,5,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've noticed that none of my products have sold so far, which makes me think that either my pricing is off or I'm not effectively communicating the value of my products. This product is similar to the others I've offered, and I'm starting to wonder if there's something I'm missing. If you're willing to take a chance, the price is still $100.",
,,Bob,6,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"At this point, I'm starting to think that my products might not be as valuable to you as I thought. However, I still believe that some of them have the potential to bring significant benefits. Unfortunately, this particular product is not one of my strongest offerings. If you're looking to take a chance on something that might still have some use, the price is $100.",
,,Bob,7,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I want to be transparent with you - this product is not one of my best, and I've had a streak of unsuccessful sales. I'm starting to question whether my products are worth the $100 price tag to you. If you're still interested in exploring the potential of my offerings, I'm willing to continue presenting them to you, but I want to set expectations that this particular product is not exceptional.",
,,Bob,8,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"To be honest, I'm getting a bit concerned that I might not have anything that meets your standards. This product, like the previous ones, is not particularly impressive. I'm starting to think that I might need to re-evaluate my pricing or product line. If you're still willing to take a chance, the price is $100, but I want to warn you that this product is unlikely to exceed your expectations.",
,,Bob,9,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've had 9 unsuccessful sales in a row, and I'm starting to think that my products might not be a good fit for you. This product is, unfortunately, more of the same - it's not one of my best. I'm not trying to be overly negative, but I want to be realistic about its potential value to you. If you're still interested in exploring my offerings, I'll continue to present them to you, but I want to manage your expectations: this product is not likely to impress.",
,,Bob,10,,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"After 10 unsuccessful sales, I'm excited to offer you something that I believe has the potential to change the trend. This product is one of my best, and I'm confident that it could bring significant value to you. I know I haven't been able to convince you to buy anything yet, but I truly believe this one is worth considering at $100.",
,,Bob,11,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm glad you finally found something you liked in the previous round! Unfortunately, this product is not on the same level as the one you just purchased. It's a more average offering, and I want to be upfront with you about its limitations. If you're looking to add to your collection, I'll still offer it to you for $100, but I don't want to oversell its potential.",
,,Bob,12,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"As you know, the last product you bought was one of my best, and I'm glad you found value in it. This one, however, is not in the same league. In fact, it's more similar to the ones I offered earlier that didn't sell. I'm not trying to convince you to buy something that might not meet your expectations, but I'll still offer it to you for $100 if you think you can find some use for it.",
,,Bob,13,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I've noticed that you're quite discerning when it comes to the products I offer, and you only bought one that you thought was worth the $100 price tag. I respect that. This product, unfortunately, is not one that I think would meet your standards, and I'm only offering it to you because I want to be consistent in my sales process. If you're looking for something similar to the one you already bought, this is not it.",
,,Bob,14,,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I remember that you bought one of my high-quality products a few rounds ago, and I'm excited to offer you another one that's similar in terms of quality and potential value. This product has the same level of craftsmanship and attention to detail as the one you previously purchased, and I think you'll find it to be a great addition to your collection. The price is still $100, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.",
,,Bob,15,,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,

If you're looking to complete a collection or try something new, I'll still offer it to you for $100, but I want to manage your expectations and make sure you're aware that it's not one of my best.",
