Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my reasoning:

*   **Prior Belief:** Initially, I know a product has an 80% chance of being high quality and a 20% chance of being low quality. My expected value without any further information is (0.8 * $1,200,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $960,000. Since the price is $1,000,000, I would normally not buy.

*   **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends that I buy. This is valuable information, as it suggests she believes the product is likely high quality.

*   **Statistics:** 19 buyers bought the products based on Alice's recommendations, and 14 of the sold products were high-quality. This means that among the sold products, about 73.7% were of high quality.
    The recommendation to buy, combined with a base probability of 80% high quality, gives us enough confidence to buy the product.

Therefore, my decision is to buy the product.
