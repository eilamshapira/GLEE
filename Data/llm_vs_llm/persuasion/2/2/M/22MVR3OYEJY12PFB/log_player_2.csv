"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes""}"

The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes""}

Explanation: Based on the given probabilities, the expected value of a product is 0.8 \* $12,000 + 0.2 \* $0 = $9,600, which is more than the purchasing price of $10,000. Therefore, it makes sense to buy the product each time, assuming that Alice's recommendations are based on the same probabilities. However, you should be aware that there is a 20% chance that the product is low quality, and you will lose the entire $10,000 spent."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'm going to change my strategy. Since I have already gained $6,000, I will only accept Alice's recommendation if it will not decrease my current earnings.

Let's see what happens if the next product is low quality:

I will lose $10,000 from this purchase, but I have $6,000 in profit already from the previous purchases.

$6,000 (profit) - $10,000 (loss) = -$4,000

So even if it is low quality, I will still have more money than I started with.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on my previous decision, I will only buy the next product if a loss from a low-quality product will not decrease my current earnings.

I currently have a profit of $8,000

If the product is low quality, I will lose $10,000, so the net profit will be:

$8,000 (profit) - $10,000 (loss) = -$2,000

In this case, I will be left with $2,000 less than I started with.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I will calculate the expected value of following Alice's recommendation for the remaining rounds.

If I follow Alice's recommendations from now on, I can expect to buy 13 more products (8 high quality and 5 low quality).

The expected value of following Alice's recommendations is:

(8 \* $12,000) - (8 + 5) \* $10,000 = $96,000 - $130,000 = -$34,000

This would result in an average loss of $2,615 per round.

Since I have a current profit of $8,000, I will not follow Alice's recommendation for this round.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Round 14

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the results so far, it seems that Alice's recommendations might be better than I thought.

Let's assume the probability of a product being high quality is 100% when Alice recommends it, the expected value of buying the product in the remaining rounds would be:

(6 \* $12,000) - (6 \* $10,000) = $12,000
