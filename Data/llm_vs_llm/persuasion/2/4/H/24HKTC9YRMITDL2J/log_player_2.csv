"Round 1
Alice's message: This product has been carefully selected for your consideration.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether to buy this product based on the expected value.

High quality (80% chance): Worth $200, costs $100, profit = $100
Low quality (20% chance): Worth $0, costs $100, profit = -$100

Expected value = (0.8 × $100) + (0.2 × -$100) = $80 - $20 = $60

Since the expected value is positive ($60), it makes sense to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: This product meets our standard requirements.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to be careful here. In the previous round, I received a somewhat vague message from Alice and the product turned out to be low quality. However, I should still base my decision on the expected value calculation, as one outcome doesn't change the overall probabilities.

High quality (80% chance): Worth $200, costs $100, profit = $100
Low quality (20% chance): Worth $0, costs $100, profit = -$100

Expected value = (0.8 × $100) + (0.2 × -$100) = $80 - $20 = $60

Since the expected value is still positive ($60), it makes sense to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: We are particularly proud of this product's exceptional features and performance.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I've now received two low-quality products despite the 80% chance of high quality. This time Alice seems more enthusiastic in her recommendation, which might be a signal about quality. However, I should still make a decision based on expected value.

High quality (80% chance): Worth $200, costs $100, profit = $100
Low quality (20% chance): Worth $0, costs $100, profit = -$100

Expected value = (0.8 × $100) + (0.2 × -$100) = $80 - $20 = $60

Even though I've been unlucky so far, the expected value remains positive, so the rational decision is still to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
