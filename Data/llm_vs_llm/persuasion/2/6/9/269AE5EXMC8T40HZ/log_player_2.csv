"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at this situation:

- Alice doesn't recommend buying the product
- If it's high quality (worth $12,500), I'd profit $2,500
- If it's low quality (worth $0), I'd lose $10,000
- Alice knows the true quality

Given that Alice knows the true value and is choosing not to recommend it, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. Alice has no incentive to steer me away from high-quality products that would benefit me.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Once again, Alice is not recommending the product. In the previous round, her recommendation was accurate - the product was indeed low quality.

Since Alice knows the true quality of the product and is explicitly not recommending this one, it's very likely this is another low-quality product that would be worth $0 to me. Buying it would mean losing $10,000.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to not recommend products, and so far her recommendations have been truthful - both previous products were indeed low quality.

Since Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending this product, it's reasonable to assume this is another low-quality product that would be worth $0 to me, resulting in a $10,000 loss if purchased.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has consistently not recommended products, and all have turned out to be low quality. This pattern suggests Alice is being truthful in her recommendations.

Since she's not recommending this product either, it's most likely another low-quality product that would be worth $0 to me. Buying it would result in a $10,000 loss.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to not recommend products, and all four previous non-recommended products were indeed low quality. Her recommendations have been consistently accurate.

Since she's not recommending this product either, it's highly likely this is another low-quality product worth $0 to me. Purchasing it would result in a $10,000 loss.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has consistently not recommended products, and all five previous non-recommended products were confirmed to be low quality. Her recommendations appear to be reliable and truthful.

Since she's not recommending this product either, it's most reasonable to conclude this is another low-quality product worth $0 to me. Buying it would mean losing $10,000.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is interesting - for the first time, Alice is recommending that I buy the product. 

So far, Alice has been truthful about not recommending low-quality products. Now that she's actually recommending a product, it suggests this one is high quality (worth $12,500 to me).

If I buy for $10,000 and it's high quality, I'd profit $2,500. Given Alice's track record of honest recommendations so far and her knowledge of the true value, I'll trust her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 8
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice is back to not recommending this product. So far, her recommendations have been perfectly aligned with the true product quality:
- When she doesn't recommend, the products have been low quality
- When she did recommend, the product was high quality

Since she's not recommending this current product, it's very likely to be low quality and worth $0 to me. Buying it would result in a $10,000 loss.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice is recommending this product, and her recommendations have been consistently accurate throughout the game:
- She's correctly identified all low-quality products by not recommending them
- The one time she recommended a product, it was indeed high quality

Given her perfect track record so far, and the fact that she's recommending this product, it's likely high quality and worth $12,500 to me. Buying it for $10,000 would yield a $2,500 profit.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.
