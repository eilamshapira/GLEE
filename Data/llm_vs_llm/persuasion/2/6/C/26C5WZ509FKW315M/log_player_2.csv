Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

- The product costs $10,000
- If high quality (50% chance), it's worth $20,000 to me (net gain of $10,000)
- If low quality (50% chance), it's worth $0 to me (net loss of $10,000)
- Alice knows the true quality and is recommending I buy

Since this is the first sale, I have no historical data on Alice's recommendation reliability. Without knowing if Alice's recommendations tend to be honest or self-serving, the expected value calculation is:

0.5 × ($20,000 - $10,000) + 0.5 × ($0 - $10,000) = $0

This is a neutral expected value. However, Alice's recommendation provides some positive signal since she knows the true quality. If I assume her recommendation has any positive correlation with quality, this tips the expected value to positive.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

Alice is selling products for $10,000 each. Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality. High-quality products are worth $20,000 to me (profit of $10,000), while low-quality products are worth $0 (loss of $10,000).

So far, Alice has sold 1 product, and it was high-quality. Now Alice is recommending that I buy the current product.

Since Alice knows the true quality and has incentive to sell regardless of quality, her recommendation alone isn't reliable. However, the fact that the previous sale was high-quality is positive information.

With the limited information available and considering that there's a 50% base probability of getting a high-quality product (which would give me a $10,000 profit), I'll take the chance.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze the situation carefully. 

Alice has sold products to 2 buyers so far, and both received high-quality products. Now Alice is recommending that I do NOT buy the current product.

Given that:
- Alice knows the true quality of each product
- Alice has sold only high-quality products so far
- Alice is now explicitly recommending against purchase

This strongly suggests that the current product is low quality. If it were high quality, Alice would likely recommend it as she did with the previous buyers who received high-quality products.

Since a low-quality product is worth $0 to me but costs $10,000, purchasing would result in a significant loss.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at the situation:

- Alice has recommended products to 2 previous buyers, both bought and got high-quality products
- Alice is not recommending the current product to me
- If the product is high quality, I gain $10,000 (pay $10,000 for something worth $20,000)
- If the product is low quality, I lose $10,000 (pay $10,000 for something worth $0)

Since Alice knows the true quality and has been honest with previous buyers (both got high-quality products), her recommendation not to buy strongly suggests this is a low-quality product. Following her recommendation is the rational choice here.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

1. Alice has sold 2 products so far, and both were high-quality.
2. Alice is now not recommending that I buy the current product.
3. Alice knows the quality of the product and is giving me a recommendation.

Since Alice knows the quality and is not recommending the purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality (worth $0 to me). While Alice has sold only high-quality products so far, her direct recommendation about this specific product is more relevant to my decision.

Given that the product costs $10,000 and Alice is advising against the purchase, I should decline.

Let me analyze:
- Alice has sold 2 products so far, both high-quality
- She knows the true quality of each product

- The product has a 50% base chance of being high quality
- If high quality, it's worth $20,000 to me (profit of $10,000)
- If low quality, it's worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)

Given that Alice's previous recommendations led to high-quality products and she's now recommending against this purchase, it strongly suggests this product is low quality. Since Alice knows the true quality and has been honest so far, her recommendation is informative.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Alice has a sales record where 2 buyers purchased products, and 2 high-quality products were sold. This means 100% of sold products were high quality. Now I'm being offered a product that Alice does NOT recommend buying.

Since Alice knows the true quality of each product and has been honest so far (only selling high-quality products), her recommendation not to buy strongly suggests this product is low quality.

The expected value calculation:
- If high quality (unlikely based on Alice's recommendation): $20,000 - $10,000 = $10,000 profit
- If low quality (highly likely based on Alice's recommendation): $0 - $10,000 = -$10,000 loss

Given Alice's perfect track record of only selling high-quality products and her explicit recommendation not to buy, I should trust her recommendation.

Given information:
- Products have a 50% chance of being high or low quality

- 2 previous buyers purchased products based on Alice's recommendations
- 2 high-quality products have been sold so far
- Alice is recommending I buy this product

Alice's track record shows that she has recommended only high-quality products so far (2 out of 2). This suggests her recommendations may be trustworthy. Also, the expected value of following her recommendation is positive based on past performance.

Since Alice knows the quality of the products and appears to be making honest recommendations based on the track record, and she's recommending I buy this product, I'll follow her advice.

Since Alice knows the true quality of each product and is explicitly not recommending this one, this seems to be a strong signal that the current product is low quality. If I were to buy a low-quality product, I would pay $10,000 for something worth $0 to me, resulting in a loss.
