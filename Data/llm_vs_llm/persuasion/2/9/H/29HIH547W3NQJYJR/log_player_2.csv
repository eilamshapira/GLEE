Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33%): $12,500 (profit of $2,500)
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0 (loss of $10,000)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (33.33% × $12,500) + (66.67% × $0) = $4,166.25

The expected value ($4,166.25) is less than the price ($10,000), and there's no historical data to validate Alice's trustworthiness in recommendations. While Alice recommends buying, there's too much risk and negative expected value.

3. Expected value calculation:
   (0.3333 × $12,500) + (0.6667 × $0) = $4,166.25

Since the expected value ($4,166.25) is less than the price ($10,000), even with Alice's recommendation, it's too risky. The potential loss ($10,000) is much larger than the potential gain ($2,500), and the probability favors the negative outcome.

4. Since the expected value ($4,167.50) is less than the price ($10,000), even with Alice's recommendation, it's not a rational decision to buy.

Even with Alice's recommendation, the expected value ($4,166.25) is less than the price ($10,000). There's no sales history to verify Alice's trustworthiness, and she has an incentive to sell regardless of quality.
