**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is the only information we have. Since she doesn't recommend the product, and we have no other information to suggest otherwise, it's best to pass. The potential reward of a high-quality product is outweighed by the risk of getting a worthless low-quality product."

**Reasoning:**

Alice knows the true quality of the product and is not recommending it. Since there is no historical data to suggest otherwise, we should trust Alice's recommendation and pass on the product."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has no information to base her recommendation on since this is the first sale.  Since the product has a 50% chance of being high quality and a 50% chance of being low quality, and a low-quality product is worthless to me, it's not a good risk to take."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since there is no historical data, we have no information to work with except Alice's recommendation. Alice, who knows the true quality of the product, is recommending against buying it. This strongly suggests the product is likely low quality. Given the 50/50 chance and the potential for a complete loss, it's best to pass on this product."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is the only information we have. Since Alice knows the quality of the product and wants to maximize her profit, she would only recommend a product if it were high quality. Therefore, her negative recommendation strongly suggests that the product is low quality, making it not worth the $10,000 price."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since there is no prior sales data, her recommendation is based purely on her knowledge of the product's quality. Given she recommends against buying, it's highly likely the product is low quality, making it a risky purchase.  The potential gain (a high-quality product) is outweighed by the potential loss (a low-quality product)."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since there's no prior sales data, her recommendation is based solely on her knowledge of the product's quality.  Because she's recommending against buying, it's highly likely the product is low quality.  The potential loss ($10,000) outweighs the potential gain ($20,000) given the high risk of the product being worthless."

**Reasoning:**

* **No previous sales data:** There's no information on the quality of past products, so we can't learn from past experience.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, who knows the true quality, is recommending against buying. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a 50/50 chance the product is high quality, the potential loss ($10,000) outweighs the potential gain ($10,000) in this scenario. 

It's better to pass and wait for a potential future product with more information or a positive recommendation from Alice."
