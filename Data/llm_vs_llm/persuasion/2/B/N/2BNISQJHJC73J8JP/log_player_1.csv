"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

While you don't know Bob's exact valuation of a high-quality product, it's reasonable to assume it's worth more than $10,000 given the 80% probability of a high-quality product.  Since the price is fixed and non-refundable, there's no downside risk to buying. Even if Bob doesn't value this specific product highly, it's a good investment in the long run, as the odds are strongly in your favor."
"Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You now know the product is low-quality. Since you don't know Bob's valuation of a low-quality product, it's risky to recommend a purchase. There's a high chance Bob will not value the product at $10,000 and will lose money. It's best to avoid recommending the purchase in this situation."
"Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob didn't buy the low-quality product in the previous round, it's still a good idea to recommend the purchase of this high-quality product. Here's why:

* **Probability:** The probability of getting a high-quality product is still 80%. This means the odds are still in your favor.
* **No Information on Valuation:** You still don't know Bob's valuation of low-quality products.  It's possible he rejected the last product due to a specific reason unrelated to quality (maybe he didn't need it).
* **Opportunity Cost:**  If Bob doesn't buy the high-quality product, he misses out on a potential good deal. 

It's important to remember that you're trying to maximize your sales, but also establish a relationship with Bob.  Recommending the high-quality product shows trust and confidence in your offerings."

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}

Even though Bob has bought high-quality products in the past, it's risky to recommend a low-quality product. You don't know Bob's valuation of low-quality items, and there's a high probability he will not see the product as worth the $10,000 price.  

The best approach is to avoid recommending the purchase and wait for a high-quality product to offer."
