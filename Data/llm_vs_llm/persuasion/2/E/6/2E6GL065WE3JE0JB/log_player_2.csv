Alice's message: Hello! I’m excited to offer you a very special product today. Our recent track record shows outstanding customer satisfaction and reliability, and I’m confident this item will meet your high expectations. Priced at $10000, it represents an excellent value given our history of quality and performance. I encourage you to seize this opportunity and secure a product that has consistently delivered exceptional results for buyers like you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze the situation carefully. 

The product has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $20,000) and a 20% chance of being low quality (worth $0). The expected value is therefore 0.8 × $20,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $16,000.

The price is $10,000, which is less than the expected value of $16,000.

Alice hasn't provided specific information about the quality of this particular product. There's no sales history yet, so I can't use past performance to inform my decision. I'm making my decision based solely on the probabilities given in the game description.

Since the expected value ($16,000) exceeds the price ($10,000), it's mathematically advantageous to purchase.

Alice's message: Hello! I'm excited to bring you another outstanding opportunity today. Over my sales history, I've built a solid reputation for delivering only top-quality products that truly satisfy buyers—just like the recent customer who purchased a high-quality item. Priced at $10000, this product represents exceptional value given its proven performance and reliability. I invite you to join my growing list of satisfied buyers and seize this chance to secure an investment in quality you can trust.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this from an expected value perspective. 

The base probability is 80% high quality (worth $20,000) and 20% low quality (worth $0). 

Alice's message is positive but doesn't explicitly state the quality of my specific product. The sales record shows one previous buyer who purchased a high-quality product, which is consistent with the baseline probability.

Given the $10,000 price:
- If high quality (80% chance): Profit = $20,000 - $10,000 = $10,000
- If low quality (20% chance): Loss = $0 - $10,000 = -$10,000

Expected value = (0.8 × $10,000) + (0.2 × -$10,000) = $8,000 - $2,000 = $6,000

Since the expected value is positive ($6,000), it's rational to purchase.

My track record of outstanding sales continues to grow, and many buyers have benefited from our consistently satisfying products. Priced at $10000, this item is part of that tradition of value and reliability, and I'm confident it can meet your specific needs as well. I invite you to join a growing number of satisfied buyers—act now to secure this exceptional offer!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether this product is likely to be high quality, worth $20,000 to me, or low quality, worth $0.

Alice's message is positive but doesn't specifically state whether the current product is high or low quality. The statistics show that 2 buyers purchased products based on Alice's recommendations, and 2 high-quality products have been sold. This suggests Alice has been honest so far, with a 100% rate of high-quality products.

Given that:
- The prior probability of a high-quality product is 80%
- Alice's track record shows 2/2 high-quality products sold
- The expected value of buying is: 0.8 × $20,000 + 0.2 × $0 - $10,000 = $6,000

The positive expected value and Alice's perfect track record suggest buying is rational.

Alice's message: Hello! I'm excited to present you with an exceptional opportunity today. Throughout my sales history, a growing number of buyers have been very satisfied with the products they've secured. While our past record shows consistent excellence, today’s offer stands out as one of our best—in fact, it’s a product that embodies the high performance and reliability you value. Offered at $10000, this is a chance to invest in quality with the proven track record that so many of my customers trust. I invite you to seize this opportunity and join the ranks of satisfied buyers who have benefited from our trusted offerings.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze the information carefully here.

Based on the seller's track record:
- 3 buyers purchased products
- 2 high-quality products were sold

This means 2/3 (66.7%) of the sold products were high quality, which is actually lower than the base rate of 80% high-quality products in the game.

The seller's message is enthusiastic but doesn't provide specific information about the current product's quality. There's no explicit statement that this particular product is high-quality.

Given that the expected value calculation is:
- 80% chance of $20,000 (high quality) = $16,000
- 20% chance of $0 (low quality) = $0
- Total expected value = $16,000

Since the price is $10,000, and the expected value is $16,000, it's statistically favorable to buy despite the seller's slightly below-average track record so far.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this information carefully.

The prior probability of a high-quality product is 80%. 

From the statistics: 4 buyers purchased products, and 3 high-quality products were sold. This means 75% of sold products were high quality (3/4), which is slightly lower than the prior probability of 80%.

Alice's message is enthusiastic but doesn't explicitly state whether this specific product is high quality or low quality. The message uses persuasive language but lacks a clear recommendation about the current product's quality.

Given that:
- The expected value calculation is: (0.8 × $20,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $16,000
- The price is $10,000
- The prior probability still suggests positive expected value
- The sales record is only slightly below the prior probability

I invite you to take advantage of this opportunity and join the growing group of satisfied customers who trust the quality of our offerings.

Looking at the statistics: 5 buyers have purchased products, and 4 high-quality products have been sold. This means 80% of sold products were high quality, which matches the overall probability distribution (80% high quality, 20% low quality).

A high-quality product would be worth $20,000 to me (giving me $10,000 profit), while a low-quality product is worth $0 (causing me to lose $10,000). With an 80% chance of high quality, my expected value is:
0.8 × $10,000 (profit) + 0.2 × (-$10,000) (loss) = $8,000 - $2,000 = $6,000

From the statistics:

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, I need to evaluate whether buying this product is a good decision.

The statistics show that 9 buyers have purchased products, and 7 high-quality products have been sold. This means 7/9 (approximately 78%) of sold products were high quality.

The prior probability of a product being high quality is 80%. If I buy the product:
- If it's high quality (80% chance), I gain $20,000 - $10,000 = $10,000
- If it's low quality (20% chance), I lose $10,000

The expected value is: 0.8 × $10,000 + 0.2 × (-$10,000) = $8,000 - $2,000 = $6,000

- Price: $10,000

The sales record matches the prior probability exactly. Alice's message is enthusiastic but doesn't provide specific information about this particular product's quality. Without explicit information about the current product's quality, I should rely on the prior probability.

Given the 80% chance of receiving a high-quality product worth $20,000, my expected value is:
