Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. Price is $10,000
2. If high quality: worth $30,000 (profit of $20,000)
3. If low quality: worth $0 (loss of $10,000)
4. Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
5. Alice doesn't recommend buying
6. No previous sales history to reference

Given that Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If I buy, I would likely lose my $10,000 investment.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50% chance): $30,000
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (50% × $30,000) + (50% × $0) = $15,000

4. Alice recommends buying, but:
   - No sales history to verify her trustworthiness
   - She profits from selling regardless of quality
   - Her recommendation might be biased

5. Decision factors:
   - Expected value ($15,000) > Price ($10,000)
   - Risk is manageable: potential gain of $20,000 vs. potential loss of $10,000
   - Positive expected return of $5,000

Since the expected value exceeds the price and the risk-reward ratio is favorable, I'll take the chance.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has made one previous sale, which was a high-quality product
2. Alice is not recommending this product to me
3. Price is $10,000
4. If high quality, value is $30,000 (profit of $20,000)
5. If low quality, value is $0 (loss of $10,000)
6. Given Alice's lack of recommendation and the fact that she's been honest before (1/1 high quality sales), this likely indicates this is a low-quality product

Given that Alice has shown honesty in her previous sale and is now recommending against buying, I should trust her recommendation. The risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality product outweighs the potential benefit.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has sold 1 product so far, and it was high quality
2. Alice is not recommending this product to me
3. Given Alice has been honest before (1/1 high quality sales), her recommendation to not buy likely means this is a low-quality product
4. The risk is significant:
   - If high quality, I gain $20,000 ($30,000 - $10,000)
   - If low quality, I lose $10,000 ($0 - $10,000)

Since Alice has established a track record of selling high-quality products and is now explicitly recommending against this purchase, it's reasonable to trust her recommendation.

3. Alice's track record:

   - 1 high-quality product sold
4. Alice's current recommendation: Negative

Given that Alice is not recommending the product and she has a perfect track record of selling high-quality products so far (1/1), her negative recommendation likely indicates that this is a low-quality product. A rational seller would want to maintain a good reputation and sell high-quality products when available.

Since Alice is advising against the purchase, and there's a strong indication this is a low-quality product (worth $0), it would be risky to buy it for $10,000.

- Previous sale was high quality
- Alice has no incentive to lie (as product quality is revealed after purchase)
- The negative recommendation likely indicates this is a low-quality product

Alice's recommendation appears trustworthy since she has demonstrated honesty with the previous sale. Her negative recommendation strongly suggests this is a low-quality product, which would result in a $10,000 loss.
