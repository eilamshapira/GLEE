{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, the fact that Alice, who knows the product's quality, recommends buying it heavily suggests it's high quality.  The previous buyer's purchase also adds to the likelihood of a good product.  

The potential payoff of $20,000 (the difference between the product's value to you and the price) outweighs the risk of losing $10,000."

~

{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is strong evidence that the product is high-quality.  Since all the products sold so far have been high-quality, there's a high probability that this trend will continue. 

While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $20,000 ($30,000 value - $10,000 cost) outweighs the risk."

{""decision"": ""yes""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Evidence:** All 4 previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation received high-quality products. This is a very strong indication that Alice is accurately identifying high-quality products. 
* **High Expected Value:** Given the current information, the probability of getting a high-quality product is very high.  The potential gain of $20,000 (worth to you minus price) significantly outweighs the potential loss of $10,000. 

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the current data and the assumption that Alice is acting in a way that benefits her. There's always a chance that the pattern could change, but the current information strongly favors buying."
