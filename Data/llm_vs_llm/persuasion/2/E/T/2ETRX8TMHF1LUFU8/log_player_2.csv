Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Possible values:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $12,500
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): $0

3. Expected value without additional information:
   (0.3333 × $12,500) + (0.6667 × $0) = $4,166.25

4. Alice's recommendation:
   - She doesn't recommend buying
   - As the seller, she has full information about quality
   - Her negative recommendation likely indicates this is a low-quality product

Given that:
- The expected value without information ($4,166.25) is already below the price ($10,000)
- Alice's negative recommendation strongly suggests this is a low-quality product
- If it's low quality, I would lose the entire $10,000

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product costs $10,000
2. If high quality (33.33% chance): worth $12,500 (profit of $2,500)
3. If low quality (66.67% chance): worth $0 (loss of $10,000)
4. Alice doesn't recommend buying
5. No prior sales history to reference

Expected value calculation:
- 33.33% chance of $2,500 profit = $833
- 66.67% chance of $10,000 loss = -$6,667
Total expected value = -$5,834

Given that:
1. The expected value is negative
2. The seller explicitly doesn't recommend buying
3. There's no positive sales history to offset these negative signals

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   * High quality (33.33% chance): $12,500 profit = $2,500
   * Low quality (66.67% chance): $0 value = -$10,000 loss

Expected value calculation:
(33.33% × $2,500) + (66.67% × -$10,000) = $833.25 - $6,667 = -$5,833.75

Even with Alice's recommendation, the expected value is negative. Without any historical data to validate Alice's trustworthiness in recommendations, it's too risky to make the purchase.

3. Expected value calculation:

4. Key considerations:
   - Expected value ($4,166.25) is less than price ($10,000)
   - Seller doesn't recommend buying
   - No previous sales history to reference
   - Seller's recommendation aligns with mathematical expectation

Given that the expected value is significantly below the asking price and the seller is not recommending the purchase, the rational decision would be not to buy.

Given that Alice doesn't recommend buying and there's no sales history to establish trust, combined with the fact that the expected value ($4,167) is significantly lower than the asking price ($10,000), it would be risky to buy.
