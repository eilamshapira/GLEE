Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's recommendation is tempting, there's no information to base it on. Since no products have been sold before, there's no historical data to suggest the product is more likely to be high quality.  

Given the higher probability of a low-quality product (66.67%), it's too risky to buy without any evidence to support its quality."
"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since there is no information about the quality of previous products, we can only rely on Alice's recommendation.  While there's a higher probability the product is low quality (66.67%), a recommendation from Alice provides some level of signal, even if it's not perfect. The potential gain of $25 (if it's high quality) outweighs the risk of losing $100 (if it's low quality). This is a gamble, but with no prior data, it's the best decision based on the available information."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is valuable information. Since she recommended buying, this suggests she believes the product is high quality. With only one previous sale, we don't have much data on the proportion of high-quality products, but the fact that the previous buyer purchased based on Alice's recommendation is encouraging. While the odds are still against us (66.67% chance of low quality), the potential reward of $125 outweighs the risk of losing $100. It's a gamble, but the recommendation and the previous sale give us a reason to believe the product might be high quality."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

Here's the reasoning:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending you buy the product. This means she believes it's likely to be high quality, even though she doesn't know the true value to you.
* **Past Sales:**  All previous sales were high-quality products. This heavily suggests that the product is likely to be high-quality.
* **Value:** If the product is high-quality, it's worth $125 to you, which is a significant profit.
* **Risk:** While there is a chance the product is low-quality, the evidence strongly suggests otherwise.  You stand to lose $100 if it's low-quality, but gain $25 if it's high-quality.

**Based on this information, the potential reward outweighs the potential risk.**"
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 3 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 3 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 4th buyer!

* **Alice's Recommendations:** All 3 buyers who followed Alice's recommendations ended up with high-quality products.
* **High Probability:**  This suggests a very strong correlation between Alice's recommendations and high-quality products. 
* **Potential Gain:**  The potential payoff of a high-quality product ($125) far outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0).

Therefore, it's a good idea to buy the product based on Alice's recommendation and the past data."

{""decision"": ""yes""}

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  Alice has sold 3 high-quality products out of 4 total sales. This indicates a very strong likelihood of the product being high-quality. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the purchase, which suggests she believes it to be a good product. While she doesn't know your specific valuation, her recommendation is a valuable signal.

**Risk vs. Reward:**

While there's still a chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of $125 significantly outweighs the risk of losing $100.  With the high success rate and Alice's recommendation, it's a calculated risk worth taking."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which implies she believes the product is likely high quality.
* **Sales Statistics:**  3 out of 5 previous buyers who purchased based on Alice's recommendations got high-quality products (60% success rate). This is significantly higher than the 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product randomly.

Even with the risk, the data and Alice's recommendation suggest a higher probability of getting a high-quality product."

* **The recommendation is positive:** Alice recommends buying the product, suggesting she believes it's high quality.

* **Potential Gain:** The potential gain from a high-quality product is significant ($125), and the potential loss is minimal ($0).
