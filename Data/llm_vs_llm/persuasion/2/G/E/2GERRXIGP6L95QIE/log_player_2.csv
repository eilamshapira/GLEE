Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's the breakdown:

*   **Prior Probability:** Before any information, the product has an 80% chance of being high quality and worth $1,250,000 to me, and a 20% chance of being low quality and worth $0 to me.

*   **Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying.

*   **Alice's Incentive:** Alice wants to sell the product, regardless of its quality. Thus, Alice's recommendation is not necessarily based on the actual quality, but rather solely on selling. Thus the recommendation is non-informative.

*   **Statistics:** The statistics indicate that 4 high quality products were sold so far. This is consistent with the prior probability.

*   **Expected Value:**
    *   If I buy, my expected value is (0.80 * $1,250,000) + (0.20 * $0) - $1,000,000 = $1,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $0
    *   If I don't buy, my expected value is $0.

Since the expected value of buying is $0, I will buy the product to see what happens.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my reasoning:

*   **My Value:** A high-quality product is worth $1,250,000 to me, and a low-quality product is worth $0.
*   **Alice's Price:** The price is fixed at $1,000,000.
*   **Base Probability:** The base probability of a high-quality product is 80%.

Without any further information, buying would be a good bet, since the expected value is: 0.8 * $1,250,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $1,000,000. That is, the expected value equals the price.

However, Alice *does not* recommend the product. This is crucial information. Alice knows the quality of the product offered to me, but I don't. Given that Alice *doesn't* recommend it, and the only reason for that would be that the product is actually low quality.

The fact that all previously sold products were high-quality is irrelevant. I should only focus on the quality of the current product.

Therefore, given Alice's lack of recommendation, I should assume the product is low quality.
