low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I want to be upfront with you, the previous products didn't meet your expectations, and I understand that. However, I'm required to offer each product at the same price of $10000.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"So far, none of the products have been sold. I'm starting to think that the price might not be the issue, but rather the uncertainty about the product's quality. I'll be honest, this product is not the best one, but it's still available for $10000 if you're willing to take the risk.",
,,Bob,5,,no

I'm starting to think that your valuation of low-quality products is significantly lower than $10000. This product is another low-quality one, and I'm wondering if anything has changed your mind about purchasing one at this price point.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"It seems that your interest lies in high-quality products, as you've consistently purchased those and passed on the low-quality ones.

This product is another low-quality one, and I'm wondering if there's anything that could change your mind about purchasing one at this price.",
,,Bob,15,,no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,

Will you consider adding a low-quality product to your collection?",
,,Bob,19,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
