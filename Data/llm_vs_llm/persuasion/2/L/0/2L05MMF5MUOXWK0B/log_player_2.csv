Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Value if high quality (80% chance): $1,200,000
3. Value if low quality (20% chance): $0
4. Expected value = (0.8 × $1,200,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $960,000

The expected value ($960,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), even with Alice's recommendation. Since this is the first sale, we don't have any historical data to verify Alice's trustworthiness.

Given that the expected value is lower than the price, it would not be rational to buy.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Value if high quality: $1,200,000 (profit of $200,000)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
4. Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
5. Alice recommends buying

Expected value calculation:
* 80% chance of $200,000 profit = $160,000
* 20% chance of $1,000,000 loss = -$200,000
* Net expected value = -$40,000

Even though Alice recommends buying, I should be cautious since there's no track record yet. The expected value is negative, suggesting it's not a good investment.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this decision:

1. Product price: $1,000,000
2. Possible values:
   - High quality (80% chance): $1,200,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value = (0.8 × $1,200,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $960,000

The expected value ($960,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), but Alice is recommending the purchase. However, without any prior sales history to establish Alice's credibility in recommendations, and given that the expected value is below the purchase price, it would be rational to decline.

3. Factors to consider:

   * Expected value ($960,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000)

Since the expected value is less than the price, and there's no sales history to build trust, it would be financially unwise to make the purchase.

Even though Alice recommends buying the product, the expected value ($960,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000). This means that, on average, I would lose $40,000 on each purchase.

1. Base probability of high quality: 80%
2. Price: $1,000,000
3. Value if high quality: $1,200,000 (profit of $200,000)
4. Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
5. Alice doesn't recommend buying
6. No previous sales data to reference

Expected value calculation:
- Without considering Alice's recommendation:
  0.8 × $1,200,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $960,000

The fact that Alice doesn't recommend buying is a significant red flag, especially since she knows the true quality. This likely means the product is low quality.

Given Alice's negative recommendation, I should not buy the product as the risk of losing $1,000,000 is too high.
