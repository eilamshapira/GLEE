Wait a moment, I need to rethink my strategy here. If I keep blindly following Alice's recommendations, I might end up buying a low-quality product sooner or later. Let me consider the odds and get back to you.

Given that each product has an equal chance of being high or low quality, and Alice knows the quality of the product, it would be beneficial to follow her recommendations. However, there's a risk involved.

Let's analyze the situation:
- If I buy a product when Alice recommends it, I have a 50% chance of gaining $250,000 and a 50% chance of losing $1,000,000.
- If I don't buy a product when Alice doesn't recommend it, I avoid any loss, but I also don't gain anything.

Given the results so far, I'll continue to trust Alice's recommendations.
