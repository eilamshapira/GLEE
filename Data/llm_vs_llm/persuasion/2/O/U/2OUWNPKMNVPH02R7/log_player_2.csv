"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. If product is high quality (50% chance): Value = $20,000
   If product is low quality (50% chance): Value = $0
   Expected value = (0.5 × $20,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $10,000

2. Cost is $10,000

3. Expected profit = Expected value - Cost
   = $10,000 - $10,000 = $0

4. Since this is the first round, I don't have any information about Alice's recommendation patterns yet.

Given that the expected value equals the cost, making the decision neutral from a pure mathematical standpoint, I will buy to see if Alice's recommendations carry any meaningful signal.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Interesting development:

1. In Round 1:
- Alice recommended to buy
- Product was high quality
- This was a profitable outcome (+$10,000)

2. Now Alice is again recommending to buy.
- If Alice is being honest with recommendations, this could be another good opportunity
- However, one positive recommendation isn't enough to fully trust the pattern

3. Basic expected value remains:
- 50% chance of $20,000 value
- 50% chance of $0 value
- Expected value = $10,000
- Cost = $10,000

Since Alice's previous recommendation was truthful and profitable, and she's recommending again, I'll continue to buy to gather more data about her recommendation patterns.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze what we know:

1. Pattern so far:
- Round 1: Alice recommended buy → High quality (Profit: +$10,000)
- Round 2: Alice recommended buy → High quality (Profit: +$10,000)
- Now: Alice recommends buy again

2. This is starting to look like a pattern where Alice might be:
- Only recommending high-quality products
- Being honest with her recommendations

3. While it could still be coincidence, there's increasing evidence that Alice's recommendations carry positive value:
- If she's only recommending high-quality products, expected value would be $20,000
- Much higher than the $10,000 cost

Given the consistent pattern of truthful recommendations leading to profitable outcomes, I'll continue to trust Alice's recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!

Round 4

1. Pattern so far:
- Round 1: Recommended buy → High quality (+$10,000)
- Round 2: Recommended buy → High quality (+$10,000)
- Round 3: Recommended buy → High quality (+$10,000)
- Now: Does NOT recommend buy

2. This is a significant change:
- Alice has been 100% accurate so far
- This is her first negative recommendation
- If she's being consistently honest, this suggests the product is low quality

3. Evidence suggests:
- Alice appears to be giving honest recommendations
- She seems to recommend buying only high-quality products
- When she doesn't recommend, it's likely low quality

Given that:
- Alice's recommendations have been reliable
- This is her first negative recommendation
- She likely has no incentive to suddenly start lying

I will trust her negative recommendation and not buy.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
