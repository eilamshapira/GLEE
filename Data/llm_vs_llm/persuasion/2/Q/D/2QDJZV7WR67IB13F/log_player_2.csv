"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This is a classic example of the ""Monty Hall problem"" with a twist. Here's why buying is the best strategy:

* **Initial Odds:** You start with a 50/50 chance of the product being high or low quality.
* **Alice's Information:** Alice, knowing the true quality, is likely to recommend buying the product if it's high quality. This is because she wants to make a sale.
* **Updated Odds:** By recommending the product, Alice provides you with valuable information. The odds of the product being high quality are now higher than 50%. 
* **Expected Value:**  Even though there's still a chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk of a low-quality one.

While it seems counterintuitive, buying based on Alice's recommendation increases your chances of getting a high-quality product."

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation now gives you the opposite information. She's not recommending a product that's worth $4,000,000 to you.  This suggests:

* **High Probability of Low Quality:** It's likely the product is low quality, as Alice is more likely to recommend a high-quality product to maximize her sales.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Since you already have a high-quality product, the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1,000,000 doesn't outweigh the potential reward. 

It's better to pass this round."
