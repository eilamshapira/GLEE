Round 9
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Before we proceed, I want to ensure that my strategy is optimal. Given that buyers are aware of the 80% probability of a product being high-quality, and they are making decisions based on the message I send, it's crucial to consider the long-term impact on my reputation.

Recommending every product as a ""yes"" might lead to a loss of trust if buyers end up with low-quality products too often. Instead, I should be more selective to maintain a high reputation, especially since buyers consider the statistics of my selling record.

Given this, let's reevaluate the strategy for the remaining rounds. For this round, since the product is high-quality, I will recommend buying it.

```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

However, for future rounds, I will consider the overall record and the impact on my reputation before making a recommendation."
