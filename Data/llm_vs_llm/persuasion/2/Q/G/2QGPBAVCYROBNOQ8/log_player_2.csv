1. Expected Value calculation:
* 80% chance of high quality ($4,000,000) = $3,200,000
* 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
* Total Expected Value = $3,200,000

2. Cost = $1,000,000

3. Factors:
* The seller recommends buying
* No previous sales history to reference
* Expected value ($3,200,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($1,000,000)

Since the expected value ($3,200,000) is more than triple the cost ($1,000,000), even with uncertainty, this is a positive expected value decision.
