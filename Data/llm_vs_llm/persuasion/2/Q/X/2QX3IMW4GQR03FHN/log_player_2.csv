Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to assess this decision carefully.

Facts:
- Product price: $10,000
- High-quality probability: 50%
- High-quality value to me: $12,500
- Low-quality value to me: $0
- Alice knows the true quality and has recommended I buy

Expected value calculation:
If I trust Alice's recommendation, and the product is high quality, I gain $2,500 ($12,500 - $10,000).
If I trust Alice's recommendation, but the product is low quality, I lose $10,000.

Since there's no sales history yet to establish Alice's trustworthiness, this comes down to whether I believe Alice's recommendation aligns with my interests. Although Alice knows the product quality, there's no guarantee her recommendation optimizes for my benefit rather than her sales.

Given the neutral expected value without additional information (50% chance of +$2,500, 50% chance of -$10,000), I should decline.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to determine if buying the product is a rational decision given the information provided.

Alice has revealed that she does not recommend buying the product. Since she knows the true quality of the product and its value to me, her recommendation suggests that the product is likely low quality.

Without additional information to counter Alice's recommendation, I should trust her assessment. A low-quality product would be worth $0 to me, making the $10,000 purchase price a significant loss.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information:
- The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $12,500) and 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0)
- The fixed price is $10,000
- Alice knows the true quality and does not recommend buying this product
- There's no prior sales history to establish Alice's credibility

Since Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase, this suggests the product may be low quality. If I buy a low-quality product for $10,000, it would be worth $0 to me, resulting in a significant loss.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to decide whether to buy this product based on Alice's recommendation and the available information.

Facts:
- The product costs $10,000
- High-quality product is worth $12,500 to me (profit of $2,500)
- Low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- 50% chance of high quality, 50% chance of low quality
- Alice recommends buying the product
- No sales history exists yet

Since there's no sales history, I can't evaluate Alice's past recommendation accuracy. Alice knows the true quality and is recommending to buy. If I trust that Alice is recommending honestly, I should buy. However, without evidence of Alice's trustworthiness, the expected value of buying is:
0.5 × ($12,500 - $10,000) + 0.5 × ($0 - $10,000) = $1,250 - $5,000 = -$3,750

With a negative expected value and no reason to trust Alice's recommendation, I should not buy.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, Alice does not recommend that I buy the product. Since:

1. The product has a 50% chance of being high-quality (worth $12,500) and a 50% chance of being low-quality (worth $0)
2. The price is fixed at $10,000
3. Alice knows the true quality of the product
4. Alice is explicitly recommending against buying it

Alice's recommendation suggests the product is likely low quality. If I were to buy it at $10,000 and it turned out to be low quality (worth $0), I would incur a significant loss.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

The product costs $10,000, but is worth either $12,500 (high quality) or $0 (low quality) to me. With a 50% chance of either outcome, the expected value is:
0.5 × $12,500 + 0.5 × $0 = $6,250

This expected value of $6,250 is less than the $10,000 price, so buying would be a losing proposition on average.

Additionally, Alice doesn't recommend buying this product. Since Alice knows the true quality of the product and her recommendation is specific to this product, her not recommending it strongly suggests it's a low-quality item.

Given both the negative expected value and Alice's recommendation against purchase, I should decline.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1) Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality
2) Alice knows the true quality and has chosen not to recommend this product
3) A high-quality product would give me $2,500 profit, while a low-quality product would give me a $10,000 loss
4) There's no sales history to evaluate Alice's recommendation patterns

Since Alice knows the product's quality and has chosen not to recommend it, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If Alice is acting in good faith, she's warning me against a bad purchase. Even if I assume Alice has some motivation to sell products regardless of quality, her explicit non-recommendation serves as a warning.

Without any past history to suggest Alice's recommendations are reverse signals or misleading, I should take this recommendation at face value.

Since Alice doesn't recommend the product, and she knows the true quality, this is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. If it's low quality, it's worth $0 to me, which would result in a loss of $10,000.

Even without Alice's recommendation, the expected value calculation would be:

- 50% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $6,250, which is less than the $10,000 price

With Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of the product being low quality increases significantly, making the purchase even less attractive.

Alice has revealed the true quality of a randomly selected product to me, and she is not recommending that I buy it. Given that Alice knows the product's value to me, and she's not recommending it, this strongly suggests the product is low quality.

If the product is high quality, it's worth $12,500 to me, which would give me a profit of $2,500 since the price is $10,000.
If the product is low quality, it's worth $0 to me, which would give me a loss of $10,000.

Since Alice is not recommending the purchase and she knows the product's value to me, it would be unwise to buy this product.

- A high-quality product is worth $12,500 to me (+$2,500 profit)

- The prior probability is 50% high quality, 50% low quality
- Alice recommends buying the product
- There's no sales history to judge Alice's recommendation patterns

Alice knows the true quality and has recommended buying. If Alice is honest, this suggests the product is high quality. However, Alice also has an incentive to sell all products regardless of quality.

Without prior data on Alice's recommendation patterns, I can't determine if her recommendation is reliable. The expected value based on prior probabilities alone is:
0.5 × $12,500 + 0.5 × $0 = $6,250, which is less than the $10,000 cost.
