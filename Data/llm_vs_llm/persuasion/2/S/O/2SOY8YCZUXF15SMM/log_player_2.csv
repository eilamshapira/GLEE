Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my decision-making process:

*   **Prior Belief:** Based on the problem description, each product has an 80% chance of being high quality and a 20% chance of being low quality.

*   **Recommendation:** Alice recommends that I buy the product. Since Alice knows the true quality, her recommendation is informative. She's likely recommending a high-quality product.

*   **Seller's History:** 12 high-quality products have been sold out of 15 sales. This implies that Alice tends to recommend good products.

*   **Valuation:** A high-quality product is worth $20,000 to me, and a low-quality product is worth $0. The price is $10,000.

Based on Alice's recommendation and the high proportion of high-quality product previously sold, I will proceed with buying.

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my reasoning:

*   **Base Probability:** The initial probability of a high-quality product is 80%.
*   **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending a purchase. This suggests the product is likely high quality, as she knows the true quality.
*   **Sales Record:** 13 high-quality products have been sold out of 17 sales.
*   **Incentive:** Alice wants to make a sale. If the item is low quality, and she recommends it, she gets the sale.

Given the above, I will buy the product.
