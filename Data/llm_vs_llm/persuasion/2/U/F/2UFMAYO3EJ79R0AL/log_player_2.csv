"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given Alice's recommendation not to buy the product, I should consider what this might indicate about the product's quality.

If Alice is being truthful, she's likely telling me the product is low quality. Since a low-quality product is worth $0 to me but costs $1,000,000, I would lose money by purchasing it.

Even if Alice has strategic motives, there's no clear reason why she would discourage me from buying a high-quality product when she gets the same $1,000,000 either way.

Without additional information about Alice's strategy, the safest choice is to follow her recommendation.
