Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information:

*   Price: $1,000,000
*   High-quality worth: $1,250,000
*   Low-quality worth: $0
*   Probability of high quality: 33.33%
*   Probability of low quality: 66.67%
*   Alice does *not* recommend buying.
*   One previous buyer bought a product, and it was high quality.

Since Alice doesn't recommend buying, it suggests the product is likely low quality. The fact that the previous product sold was high quality doesn't necessarily change the odds for *this* particular product. If Alice were simply selling without any specific recommendation, the expected value of a product would be (0.3333 * $1,250,000) + (0.6667 * $0) = $416,625.  This is far less than the price of $1,000,000.

Since Alice is *not* recommending the product, it further lowers my expectation of its quality. Therefore, it's prudent to pass.
