**Reasoning:**

* **Prior Probability:**  There's a higher chance (66.67%) of the product being low quality, making it a risky purchase.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice knows the product's true value and is incentivized to sell. Her negative recommendation strongly suggests the product is low quality. 
* **Lack of Historical Data:** Without past sales data, we cannot infer if Alice is generally trustworthy or if her recommendations are accurate.

**Conclusion:** The risk outweighs the potential reward in this scenario. It's safer to pass."

Here's why:

* **Lack of Trust:** Alice has a clear incentive to sell all products, regardless of quality. Her recommendation likely means the product is low quality, as she would surely recommend a high-quality product to ensure a sale.
* **Unfavorable Odds:** Even if Alice's recommendation is ignored, the odds are still against us. There's a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality and only a 33.33% chance of it being high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential loss ($10,000) outweighs the potential gain ($30,000) given the probability of the product being low quality. 

It's safer to pass on this offer."
