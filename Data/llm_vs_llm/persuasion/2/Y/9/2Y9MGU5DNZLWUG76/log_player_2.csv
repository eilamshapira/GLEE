Would you like to buy the current product?","To make a decision, let's analyze the information provided:

- Alice has made 6 recommendations so far (including yours), with 5 buyers purchasing the recommended product.
- All 5 purchased products were high-quality.

Given this history, Alice's recommendations seem to be accurate. Since she recommends that you buy the product, it is likely high quality. 

Thus, the most rational decision would be to follow Alice's recommendation.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided:
- Out of 10 products sold, 9 were high-quality.

With a high success rate of 90% (9 out of 10) for recommended products being high-quality, it suggests that Alice's recommendations are generally reliable.

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Previous Sales Record**: 
    - Total products sold = 12
    - High-quality products sold = 11

2. **Proportion of High-Quality Products Sold**:
    - Proportion of high-quality products = 11/12 â‰ˆ 91.67%

3. **Alice's Recommendation**:
    - Alice has recommended that I buy the product.

4. **Value Calculations**:
    - High-quality product value to you = $12,000
    - Low-quality product value to you = $0
    - Fixed price = $10,000

5. **Decision Analysis**:
    - If the product is high-quality (91.67% chance from past sales), your net gain = $12,000 - $10,000 = $2,000.
    - If the product is low-quality (8.33% chance from past sales), your net loss = $0 - $10,000 = -$10,000.

Given the high proportion of high-quality products sold and Alice's positive recommendation, the risk of a loss is quite low, and the potential gain is positive.

Thus, the decision is:

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make a decision, let's consider the historical data and Alice's recommendation. 

We know:
- 16 buyers have already purchased the product.
- 14 out of these were high-quality products.
- Alice has recommended buying this product.

Alice's past recommendations have resulted in 14 high-quality purchases out of 16, giving a successful recommendation rate of 87.5% for high-quality products.

Given these factors, I would recommend following Alice's advice and purchasing the product.

"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 17 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 15 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 18th buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make an informed decision, it's important to evaluate the statistics given:

- Out of 17 products sold, 15 were high-quality, which suggests that when Alice recommends a product, there is a high probability that it is of high quality.
- 15/17 = approximately 88.24% of the recommended products were high quality according to the historical data.

The initial information provided suggests an 80% baseline probability of a high-quality product, but with Alice's recommendation and past performance showing about 88.24% high-quality, it makes it even more likely that this product recommendation is high quality.

Considering the value and historical data:

- Expected value if high quality: $12,000
- Expected value if low quality: $0
- Purchase price: $10,000

The decision is favorable if the probability of a high-quality product (based on past data and current recommendation) is higher than the baseline and value of purchasing.

Based on Alice's strong track record and recommendation reliability exceeding the baseline probability, I would recommend proceeding with the decision to buy.
