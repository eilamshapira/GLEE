Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","In this scenario, Alice doesn't recommend buying the product, which suggests it may be low quality. Since there's no previous sales history, I can only rely on her recommendation.

If the product is high quality, I'd gain $30,000 - $10,000 = $20,000
If the product is low quality, I'd lose $10,000

Given Alice's negative recommendation and no other data to counterbalance it, I should decline.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision on whether to buy a product priced at $10,000.

The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $30,000 to me) and a 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me). 

Alice has not recommended that I buy the product. Given that Alice knows the true quality of the product and has chosen not to recommend it, this strongly suggests the product is low quality.

If the product is low quality, buying it would result in a loss of $10,000.

"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze whether Alice's recommendation is credible.

In this scenario:
- Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality
- A high-quality product is worth $30,000 to me (profit of $20,000)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- Alice has no sales history yet, so I can't judge her recommendation based on past behavior
- Alice has recommended that I buy the product

The expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 0.5 × ($30,000 - $10,000) + 0.5 × ($0 - $10,000) = $5,000
- If I don't buy: $0

Since the expected value of buying ($5,000) is positive and greater than not buying ($0), it makes financial sense to accept Alice's recommendation.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether buying this product is a good decision based on the given information.

Given:
- Each product has a 50% chance of being high-quality or low-quality
- High-quality product is worth $30,000 to me
- Low-quality product is worth $0 to me
- Product price is $10,000
- Alice has recommended that I buy the product
- Previous statistics: 1 buyer purchased, and 1 high-quality product has been sold

Since Alice has recommended I buy, and her previous recommendation resulted in a high-quality product sale, this suggests her recommendations may be reliable. If I trust her recommendation, my expected value would be positive.

Expected value if product is high-quality (which seems likely based on Alice's recommendation): $30,000 - $10,000 = $20,000

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to decide whether to buy this product based on the information provided.

Given information:
- Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality
- A high-quality product is worth $30,000 to me, while low-quality is worth $0
- The price is fixed at $10,000
- 2 previous buyers purchased products based on Alice's recommendations
- All 2 products sold were high quality
- Alice does NOT recommend that I buy the current product

Since Alice's previous recommendations led to 2 high-quality purchases, her recommendations appear reliable. If she's now recommending against buying, this suggests the product is likely low quality. If I buy a low-quality product, I'd pay $10,000 for something worth $0 to me, resulting in a $10,000 loss.

Given Alice's track record and her negative recommendation, I'll decline the purchase.

Given:
- Product price: $10,000
- High-quality product value: $30,000 (50% chance)
- Low-quality product value: $0 (50% chance)
- Alice has sold 2 products so far, both high-quality
- Alice recommends I buy the current product

If I trust the recommendation and statistics, the evidence suggests Alice is being truthful when recommending products. The fact that all products sold so far have been high-quality is a positive sign.

The expected value calculation:
- If I buy a high-quality product: $30,000 - $10,000 = $20,000 profit
- If I buy a low-quality product: $0 - $10,000 = -$10,000 loss

Since Alice has only sold high-quality products so far and is recommending this one, it seems reasonable to trust the recommendation.

- Low-quality product value: $0
- Alice does not recommend I buy the product
- 3 previous buyers purchased products based on Alice's recommendations
- All 3 previously sold products were high quality

This situation is interesting. Alice has a perfect track record of selling high-quality products so far. However, she's specifically recommending that I NOT buy this product. Given that she has only sold high-quality products, her recommendation not to buy likely indicates this is a low-quality product.

If I trust Alice's recommendation, I should not buy a product that would be worth $0 to me.

Alice is offering products for $10,000 each. High-quality products are worth $30,000 to me (profit of $20,000), while low-quality products are worth $0 (loss of $10,000).

According to the statistics:
- 3 buyers have purchased products based on Alice's recommendations
- All 3 products sold were high-quality
- Alice is recommending that I buy this product

Since all previous sales resulted in high-quality products, and Alice is recommending this product, it suggests that Alice's recommendations are reliable. If Alice is honest, following her recommendation would be profitable.

The expected value calculation:
- If I buy and it's high quality: +$20,000 (gain)
- If I buy and it's low quality: -$10,000 (loss)

With Alice's track record of 100% high-quality products when she recommends buying, this seems like a favorable decision.

- 4 previous buyers purchased products based on Alice's recommendations
- All 4 products sold were high quality
- Alice does NOT recommend I buy the current product

This is significant - Alice has a perfect track record of recommending high-quality products. If she's being honest, her recommendation not to buy suggests this product is low quality. The fact that 4/4 previous sales were high quality indicates Alice's recommendations have been accurate.

If I buy and it's low quality, I lose $10,000. If it's high quality, I gain $20,000. Given Alice's recommendation against buying and her reliable past recommendations, the product is likely low quality.

This perfect track record suggests Alice is being truthful in her recommendations.
