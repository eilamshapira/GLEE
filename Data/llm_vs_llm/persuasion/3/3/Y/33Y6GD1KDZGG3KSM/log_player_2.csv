Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value:
   - 80% chance of high quality ($400)
   - 20% chance of low quality ($0)

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320

Since the expected value ($320) is significantly higher than the price ($100), and Alice is recommending the purchase, it's a rational decision to buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: $400 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
3. Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
4. Alice's recommendation: Negative
5. Previous sales: 1 buyer, 1 high-quality product sold

Even though the base probability of getting a high-quality product is good (80%), Alice is not recommending this product. Since Alice has proven honest with the previous buyer (sold 1 high-quality product), her negative recommendation is likely truthful.

Given Alice's negative recommendation and her demonstrated honesty, this product is more likely to be low quality. If it's low quality, I would lose $100.
