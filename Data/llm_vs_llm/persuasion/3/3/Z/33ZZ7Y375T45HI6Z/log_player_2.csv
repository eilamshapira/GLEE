Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze the decision based on the given information:

- The product costs $10,000
- A high-quality product is worth $12,500 to me (profit of $2,500)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- There's a 50% chance the product is high quality
- Alice knows the quality of the product
- Alice does NOT recommend buying this product

Since Alice knows the true quality and is explicitly recommending against purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If I were to ignore her recommendation, my expected value would be:
(0.5 × $12,500) + (0.5 × $0) - $10,000 = $6,250 - $10,000 = -$3,750

But with Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of the product being low quality is even higher, making the expected value worse.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to carefully consider my decision based on the available information.

Given:
- The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $12,500) and 50% chance of low quality (worth $0)
- The fixed price is $10,000
- Alice knows the true quality and does not recommend buying this product
- There is no prior sales history to evaluate Alice's recommendation patterns

Since Alice knows the true quality and is explicitly not recommending the purchase, this suggests the product is likely low quality. If I purchase a low-quality product, I would lose the entire $10,000 investment.

Even without considering Alice's recommendation, the expected value calculation would be:
0.5 × $12,500 + 0.5 × $0 = $6,250, which is less than the $10,000 price.

With Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of low quality is likely even higher.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Since Alice does not recommend buying the product, this suggests that the product is likely of low quality. If it's low quality, it would be worth $0 to me, which is far less than the $10,000 asking price. Even though there's no sales history yet to validate Alice's trustworthiness, the rational choice is to follow the recommendation and not purchase the product.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully. 

Alice doesn't recommend buying the product, which suggests it might be low quality. Since there's no previous sales record to establish Alice's credibility or recommendation patterns, I must rely on the basic probability and expected value.

The product has:
- 50% chance of being high quality (worth $12,500)
- 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0)
- Fixed price of $10,000

Expected value = (0.5 × $12,500) + (0.5 × $0) = $6,250

Since the expected value ($6,250) is less than the price ($10,000), and Alice is specifically recommending against purchase, it would be financially unwise to buy.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this carefully:

- The product costs $10,000
- High-quality product (50% chance) is worth $12,500 to me
- Low-quality product (50% chance) is worth $0 to me
- Expected value: 0.5 × $12,500 + 0.5 × $0 = $6,250

Since the expected value ($6,250) is less than the asking price ($10,000), it would be a negative expected value purchase without additional information.

However, Alice is recommending I buy it. Since Alice knows the true quality and has made a recommendation, this suggests the product is likely high quality. If Alice is truthful and only recommends high-quality products, then buying would be profitable.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, I need to decide whether to buy the product Alice is recommending.

Let me analyze:
- Alice knows the true quality of the product
- Alice has recommended I buy the product
- Of previous buyers, 1 buyer purchased based on Alice's recommendation
- That 1 purchased product was high quality
- Alice's track record so far shows she has been honest

Since Alice is recommending I buy and her previous recommendation led to a high-quality product, this suggests her recommendations may be trustworthy. The expected value calculation also works out favorably if I believe her recommendation correlates with high quality.

Given that:
- Alice knows the true quality of the product
- She's not recommending this purchase
- Her track record shows 100% high-quality products sold so far
- She has been honest with previous buyers

Her lack of recommendation strongly suggests this is a low-quality product worth $0 to me, making the $10,000 price a bad deal.

Based on the statistics:
- 2 buyers purchased products based on Alice's recommendations

- The success rate of Alice's recommendations appears to be 100% (2/2)

- Value of low-quality product: $0 (loss of $10,000)
