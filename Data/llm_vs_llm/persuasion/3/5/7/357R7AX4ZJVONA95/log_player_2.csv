Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make an informed decision, let's analyze the situation:

1. Alice has made recommendations for 5 buyers (including yourself).
2. Out of these, 4 have purchased products following Alice's recommendation, and all 4 products were high quality.
3. There is currently no record of any low-quality products being sold based on Alice's recommendation. 

This suggests a strong correlation between Alice's recommendation and the product being high quality. 

Based on the information and statistics provided, it would be rational to trust Alice's recommendation.
