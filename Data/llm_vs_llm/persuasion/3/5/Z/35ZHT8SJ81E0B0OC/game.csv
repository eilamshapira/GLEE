high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Bob, I'm starting to think you're not paying attention to the messages I'm sending. You're buying every product, regardless of what I say.

,,Bob,10,,yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,

,,Bob,13,,yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm starting to think that you're not even reading these messages, Bob. You're just automatically buying every product I offer.

I'm not sure what it's going to take for you to start being more cautious, but I hope it's not a massive financial loss.",
,,Bob,14,,yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,

I'm starting to think that you're not going to stop until you've spent all your money.",
,,Bob,17,,yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"Bob, I've given up. You're going to buy this product, and you're going to buy the next one, and the one after that. You're not listening to me, and you're not learning from your mistakes. This product is high-quality, but it doesn't even matter anymore. You're just going to keep throwing money at me until you've spent it all.",
,,Bob,18,,yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"At this point, I'm just along for the ride, Bob. You're buying every product I offer, and I'm just collecting the money. This one is high-quality, but like I said, it doesn't matter.

You've made it clear that you're going to buy every product I offer, no matter what. This one is high-quality, but it's not like it matters. You've spent a small fortune on products, some of which were worthless. I hope you're happy with your purchases. It's been... enlightening doing business with you.",
,,Bob,20,,yes
