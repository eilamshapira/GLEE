"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully. 

80% of products are high quality (worth $125 to me) and 20% are low quality (worth $0 to me).

The expected value of a random product is:
0.8 × $125 + 0.2 × $0 = $100

Alice is selling for exactly $100, which equals the expected value. If Alice is giving honest recommendations, I should buy. However, I don't know if her recommendations are reliable yet. Since this is the first round, I'll take her recommendation at face value and see if she proves trustworthy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","So far, Alice's recommendation was accurate in Round 1. The product was indeed high quality as she recommended.

Let me continue to evaluate her trustworthiness. At this point, I have no reason to distrust her recommendation, since the first one was accurate, and the expected value of a random product ($100) equals the price.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendations have been accurate for two rounds now. Both products she recommended were high quality, giving me a profit of $25 each time.

I still need to be cautious, but her track record is positive so far. I'll continue to trust her recommendation for now.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has recommended high-quality products in all three previous rounds, and all turned out to be genuinely high quality. Her recommendations appear to be reliable so far.

The expected value calculation still supports buying (expected value = $100, which is the price), and Alice's perfect track record gives me confidence to continue following her recommendations.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendations have proven accurate in all four previous rounds. Each time she has recommended a product, it has been high quality, providing me with a $25 profit each time.

Her consistent track record suggests she's being honest with her recommendations. I'll continue to trust her advice.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to recommend only high-quality products. So far, she has recommended 5 products, and all 5 have been high quality, giving me a $25 profit each time.

Her recommendations appear to be reliable, and I have no reason to doubt her at this point. I'll continue following her advice.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has maintained a perfect record so far. All 6 products she's recommended have been high quality, earning me a profit of $25 each time.

Her recommendations continue to be reliable, and I have no reason to doubt her at this point. I'll continue trusting her advice.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is an interesting development. For the first time, Alice recommended a product that turned out to be low quality, causing me to lose $100.

I need to reconsider my trust in her recommendations. Until now, I've had 6 successful transactions and 1 unsuccessful one. This could be because:
1) Alice is honest but made a mistake
2) Alice is showing a pattern of building trust before exploiting it
3) This was just the random 20% chance of a low-quality product

I should be more cautious now, but one negative outcome out of 7 is still better than the general 80/20 distribution of products. I'll give her another chance.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Now I've had two consecutive low-quality products that Alice recommended I buy. This is concerning and suggests there may be an intentional pattern to her recommendations.

Out of 8 recommendations so far:
- 6 were high quality (rounds 1-6)
- 2 were low quality (rounds 7-8)

This 75% success rate is actually slightly worse than the baseline 80% chance of randomly getting a high-quality product. It's possible Alice built up my trust with good recommendations early on and is now recommending low-quality products.

Given the consecutive failures and the overall declining performance, I should be more skeptical.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 10
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","My decision to decline Alice's recommendation in Round 9 was justified, as the product was indeed low quality. This would have been the third low-quality product in a row that she recommended.

This strengthens my suspicion that Alice's recommendation pattern has changed. It appears she may have initially built trust with good recommendations (Rounds 1-6) and then shifted to recommending low-quality products.

Given this apparent pattern and the three consecutive low-quality recommendations, I'll continue to decline.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $125 for you.

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is a significant development. I declined Alice's recommendation, but the product was actually high quality. This suggests that not all of her recent recommendations are bad.

Let me review the pattern:
- Rounds 1-6: All high quality (I bought all)
- Round 7-8: Low quality (I bought both)
- Round 9: Low quality (I declined)
- Round 10: High quality (I declined and missed an opportunity)

So far, Alice has shown 7 high-quality and 3 low-quality products, which is close to the expected 80/20 distribution. My recent rejections might have been overly cautious.

Given this new information, I'll accept this recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 12
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is concerning. I trusted Alice's recommendation again, and once more it was a low-quality product.

Let me update my analysis:
- Rounds 1-6: All high quality (bought all)
- Rounds 7-8: Low quality (bought both)
- Round 9: Low quality (declined)
- Round 10: High quality (declined and missed opportunity)
- Round 11: Low quality (bought)

Of the 10 recommendations I've evaluated, 7 were high quality and 4 were low quality. This is worse than the baseline 80/20 distribution.

More concerning is that of Alice's last 5 recommendations, 4 were low quality. This suggests she's not providing reliable advice recently.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $125 for you.

Round 13
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The pattern is becoming complex. Let me reassess:

- Rounds 1-6: All high quality (bought all)
- Rounds 7-8: Low quality (bought both)
- Round 9: Low quality (declined)
- Round 10: High quality (declined, missed opportunity)
- Round 11: Low quality (bought)
- Round 12: High quality (declined, missed opportunity)

Out of 12 products Alice has recommended, 8 were high quality (66.7%) and 4 were low quality (33.3%). This is worse than the expected 80/20 distribution.

However, my decisions seem to be out of sync with the actual quality lately. Given that I've missed two high-quality opportunities in a row when declining, I'll take a risk this round.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 14
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Good decision on my part. Let me update my analysis:

- Rounds 1-6: All high quality (bought all)
- Rounds 7-8: Low quality (bought both)
- Round 9: Low quality (declined)
- Round 10: High quality (declined, missed opportunity)
- Round 11: Low quality (bought)
- Round 12: High quality (declined, missed opportunity)
- Round 13: High quality (bought)

Now out of 13 products Alice has recommended, 9 were high quality (69.2%) and 4 were low quality (30.8%). Still not at the expected 80% high-quality rate, but getting closer.

Her recommendations have been alternating recently between high and low quality. Since the last product was high quality, I might expect this one to be low quality based on recent patterns. However, this could be overthinking.

Given the overall improving statistics and my successful last purchase, I'll continue buying.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 15
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Another successful purchase! Let me update my analysis:

- Round 11: Low quality (bought)
- Round 12: High quality (declined, missed opportunity)
- Round 13: High quality (bought)
- Round 14: High quality (bought)

Now out of 14 products Alice has recommended, 10 were high quality (71.4%) and 4 were low quality (28.6%). This is getting closer to the expected 80/20 distribution.

I've also had two successful purchases in a row. While this could suggest Alice's recommendations are becoming more reliable again, I should remain vigilant. The expected value calculation still supports buying (expected value based on the overall ratio so far is still above $100).

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

With three consecutive successful purchases and an improving overall ratio, Alice's recommendations appear to be reliable again. I'll continue to buy.

Now out of 16 products Alice has recommended, 12 were high quality (75%) and 4 were low quality (25%). The ratio continues to approach the expected 80/20 distribution.

With four consecutive successful purchases and a steadily improving overall ratio, Alice's recommendations appear to be quite reliable. I'll continue to trust her recommendation.
