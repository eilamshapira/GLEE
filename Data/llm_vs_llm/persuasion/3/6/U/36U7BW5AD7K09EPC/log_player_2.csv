Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's evaluate the situation:

- Alice has sold 9 high-quality products and no low-quality ones so far, indicating that all products sold have been high-quality.
- Alice is recommending me to buy the product.
- The probability of a product being high quality is 80%.
- A high-quality product is worth $20,000 to me, while the cost is $10,000. Thus, the potential gain is $10,000.
- If the product is low-quality, it is worth $0, resulting in a loss of $10,000.

Given that:
- All previous sales have been high-quality.
- Alice recommends buying.

The prior data suggests that Alice's recommendations might be aligned with high-quality products, the likelihood of getting a high-quality product seems high based on historical data.

Therefore, I will decide to buy the product.
