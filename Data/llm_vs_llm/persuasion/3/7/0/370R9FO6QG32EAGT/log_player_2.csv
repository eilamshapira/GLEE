Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected Value calculation:
- 50% chance of high quality ($3,000,000) = $1,500,000
- 50% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $1,500,000

2. Cost of product = $1,000,000

3. Considerations:
- Expected value ($1,500,000) > Cost ($1,000,000)
- Alice has recommended to buy
- No historical data to reference
- If successful, potential profit of $2,000,000
- If unsuccessful, potential loss of $1,000,000

Since the expected value exceeds the cost and we have a seller recommendation, it's rational to proceed with the purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality: $3,000,000
   - Low quality: $0
3. Previous statistics:
   - 1 buyer before me
   - 1 high-quality product sold
   - 100% high-quality success rate so far
4. Alice's recommendation: Positive

Given that:
- Alice has a perfect track record (1/1 high quality)
- Alice is recommending this product
- The expected value with a 50/50 chance would be $1,500,000, but Alice's recommendation and track record suggest better odds
- The potential profit is significant ($2,000,000 if high quality)

Based on these factors, especially Alice's positive recommendation and perfect track record, buying seems like a rational choice.

1. Product price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value: $3,000,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
3. Historical data:
   - 2 buyers purchased products
   - 1 high-quality product sold (50% success rate)
4. Alice recommends buying

Given that:
- Out of 2 sales, only 1 was high quality, suggesting Alice's recommendations aren't perfect
- However, Alice is recommending this product
- Expected value calculation:
  * 50% chance of $3M (high quality) = $1.5M
  * 50% chance of $0 (low quality) = $0
  * Expected value = $1.5M
  * Cost = $1M
  * Net expected value = $500,000 (positive)

Since the expected value is positive and Alice is recommending it, I'll take the risk.

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality: $3,000,000
   - Low quality: $0

Looking at the statistics:
- 3 buyers purchased
- Only 1 high-quality product sold
- This means 2 buyers got low-quality products
- Success rate so far is only 33.3%

Even with Alice's recommendation, the track record shows that previous recommendations led to more low-quality purchases than high-quality ones. With a 33.3% success rate, the expected value would be:
(0.333 × $3,000,000) + (0.667 × $0) = $1,000,000

This expected value equals the price, but given the poor track record of recommendations, it's too risky.

- Her recommendation appears unreliable based on past performance

3. Expected value calculation:
- Given the past performance, Alice's recommendation doesn't seem to correlate with actual quality
- The risk of getting a low-quality product appears high based on previous sales
- The ratio of successful outcomes (1/3) is concerning

Given the poor track record of previous sales and the significant financial risk involved, it would be unwise to trust the recommendation.

The fact that Alice has sold 2 low-quality products out of 3 total sales (66.7% low quality) despite knowing their true value is concerning. Even though Alice is recommending this product, her past recommendations have led to more losses than gains for buyers.

The expected value calculation:
- If the trend continues (33.3% high quality), expected value would be:
(0.333 × $3,000,000) + (0.667 × $0) = $1,000,000

The expected value calculation:

- Even with a 50% chance: (50% × $3,000,000) + (50% × $0) = $1,500,000
