Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this logically:

1. The base probabilities are 50% high quality ($3M value) and 50% low quality ($0 value)
2. Price is $1M
3. Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying
4. There's no prior sales history to analyze
5. Expected value calculation without Alice's recommendation:
   * (50% × $3M) + (50% × $0) = $1.5M > $1M price

However, since Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase, this is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. If it were high quality ($3M value), she would likely recommend it since a sale would build her reputation.

Therefore, I should trust Alice's recommendation and not buy.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50% chance): $3,000,000
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(50% × $3,000,000) + (50% × $0) = $1,500,000

The expected value ($1,500,000) is higher than the price ($1,000,000), and Alice is recommending the purchase. While there's no track record to evaluate Alice's credibility, the pure economics suggest this is a positive expected value decision.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The seller has been honest so far - their only previous sale was a high-quality product
2. The price is $1,000,000
3. Expected value calculation:
   - 50% chance of high quality ($3,000,000) = $1,500,000
   - 50% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
   - Total expected value = $1,500,000
4. The seller is recommending to buy
5. The seller has been truthful in their previous recommendation

Since:
- The expected value ($1,500,000) is greater than the price ($1,000,000)
- The seller has shown honesty in previous transactions
- The seller is recommending to buy
- There's a positive track record (1/1 high quality)

3. Decision logic:
- Alice's perfect track record suggests she's truthful
- She's explicitly recommending against buying

- A low-quality product would result in a $1,000,000 loss
