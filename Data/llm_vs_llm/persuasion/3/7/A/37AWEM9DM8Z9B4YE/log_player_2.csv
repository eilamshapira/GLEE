Alice's message: Greetings! I have a fantastic product for sale today, priced at $10000.  It's an excellent opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $10,000
2. High quality value: $12,000 (50% chance)
3. Low quality value: $0 (50% chance)
4. Expected value: (12,000 × 0.5) + (0 × 0.5) = $6,000

The expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000), and I have no historical data to assess Alice's truthfulness. The seller's message is generic and doesn't provide specific information about the product's quality.

Given these factors, it would be economically unwise to purchase the product.

Alice's message: Hello! I'm offering a high-quality product for sale at $10000.  While I understand this is a significant investment, I assure you this product is worth every penny.  Would you like to learn more?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality: $12,000 (50% chance)
   - Low quality: $0 (50% chance)
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $12,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $6,000

Alice claims this is a high-quality product, but:
- There's no track record to verify her reliability
- She has incentive to sell regardless of quality
- Expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000)

Alice's message: Hello there! I'm offering a fantastic product for $10000. It's a great opportunity to acquire something special.  Would you be interested in learning more about it?

Would you like to buy the current product?","In this initial interaction, without any previous sales history and only a generic message from Alice without specific quality information about the product, it would be risky to make a purchase. The expected value calculation shows:

50% chance of high quality ($12,000) = $6,000
50% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
Expected value = $6,000

Since the price is $10,000 and the expected value is only $6,000, it would not be rational to buy.

Alice's message: Greetings! I'm presenting a high-quality product for sale at $10000.  It's a rare find, and I believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection.  Are you interested in learning more about it?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Cost: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - If high quality: $12,000 (profit of $2,000)
   - If low quality: $0 (loss of $10,000)
3. Probability: 50% for each outcome
4. Expected value = (50% × $12,000) + (50% × $0) = $6,000

Although Alice claims this is a high-quality product, there's no track record to verify her trustworthiness. The expected value ($6,000) is less than the asking price ($10,000), making this a mathematically unfavorable deal.

1. Price: $10,000

   * 50% chance of high quality ($12,000) = $6,000
   * 50% chance of low quality ($0) = $0

   - The seller's message is generic and doesn't provide specific quality information
   - Expected value ($6,000) is less than the asking price ($10,000)

Based on this analysis, buying would be risky and mathematically unfavorable since the expected value is lower than the asking price.

Alice claims it's high quality, but as a rational seller, she has an incentive to always claim products are high quality. With no previous sales history to establish credibility, and an expected value below the asking price, the rational choice is not to buy.

   - Alice claims it's high quality, but this could be cheap talk

The expected value is negative (-$4,000), and there's no historical data to justify trusting Alice's claim about high quality.
