Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make an informed decision, let's analyze the situation based on the provided information and Alice's recommendation:

1. Total potential buyers so far: 2
2. Products sold: 2
3. High-quality products sold: 2
4. Alice recommends buying.

Both products previously sold were high-quality, and Alice has recommended buying in our case. Given this, it's likely that Alice's recommendations are accurately aligned with the product being high-quality.

The expected value of purchasing the product is calculated as follows:
- Probability of high quality = 80% (since all previous recommendations resulted in high-quality products)
- Value if high quality = $125
- Cost of product = $100

Thus, expected value = (0.8 * $125) + (0.2 * $0) = $100

Since the expected value matches the cost of the product, it would be reasonable to follow Alice's current recommendation to buy the product.
