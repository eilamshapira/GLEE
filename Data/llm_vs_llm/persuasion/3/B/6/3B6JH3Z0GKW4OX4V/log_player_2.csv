1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (80% chance): $30,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $30,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $24,000

Since the expected value ($24,000) is significantly higher than the price ($10,000), and Alice has recommended buying the product, this appears to be a profitable opportunity.

Expected value calculation:

Looking at Alice's track record:
