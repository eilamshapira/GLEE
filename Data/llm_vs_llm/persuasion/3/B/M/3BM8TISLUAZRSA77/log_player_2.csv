Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 50% chance of $40,000 (high quality)
   - 50% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $40,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $20,000
4. Alice recommends buying
5. No prior sales history to assess Alice's trustworthiness

Since the expected value ($20,000) is higher than the price ($10,000), and we have a positive recommendation from Alice, it's rational to buy despite the lack of historical data.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Previous statistics:
- 1 buyer before me
- 1 purchase made
- 1 high-quality product sold
- This suggests Alice has been honest so far

2. Current situation:
- Alice is not recommending the purchase
- Given Alice's track record of selling high-quality products and being truthful
- Alice's negative recommendation likely means this is a low-quality product

3. Risk assessment:
- Price: $10,000
- Potential value: Either $40,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Alice has no incentive to lie as it would hurt her reputation
- Her negative recommendation strongly suggests this is a low-quality product

Given Alice's negative recommendation and her proven track record of honesty, I should trust her advice and not buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The price is $10,000
2. If high quality (50% chance), I gain $40,000 (profit = $30,000)
3. If low quality (50% chance), I gain $0 (loss = -$10,000)
4. Previous track record: 1 buyer, 1 high-quality sale
5. Alice is recommending to buy
6. Expected value calculation: (50% × $30,000) + (50% × -$10,000) = $10,000

The historical data shows Alice has been honest so far (1/1 high-quality sales), and she's recommending to buy. Combined with the positive expected value ($10,000), this seems like a good opportunity.

1. Alice has sold to 2 buyers so far
2. Both products sold were high quality (100% high-quality rate)

5. If high quality, I gain $40,000 (profit of $30,000)
6. If low quality, I gain $0 (loss of $10,000)

Alice's perfect track record and current recommendation suggest trustworthiness. While there's always risk, the potential profit ($30,000) is three times the potential loss ($10,000), and the evidence suggests Alice is honest in her recommendations.
