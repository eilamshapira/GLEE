"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me evaluate my decision.

Alice recommends buying the product, but I need to assess whether this recommendation is valuable. Since this is the first round, I don't have any history to judge Alice's truthfulness.

If I buy:
- 50% chance it's high quality: I gain $2,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $1,000,000
- 50% chance it's low quality: I lose $1,000,000

Expected value = (0.5 × $1,000,000) + (0.5 × -$1,000,000) = $0

The expected value is neutral. Since there's an equal chance of gain or loss, and I have no additional information about Alice's trustworthiness, I'll take a chance and buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me evaluate my decision for round 2.

Alice does NOT recommend buying this product. In round 1, her recommendation was accurate - she recommended buying and the product was indeed high quality. This suggests she might be giving honest recommendations.

If Alice is being truthful now in not recommending the product, it's likely low quality.

If I buy:
- If it's low quality (which seems likely based on Alice's non-recommendation): I lose $1,000,000
- If it's high quality: I gain $1,000,000

Given that Alice's previous recommendation was accurate and she's now recommending against purchase, I'll trust her judgment.
