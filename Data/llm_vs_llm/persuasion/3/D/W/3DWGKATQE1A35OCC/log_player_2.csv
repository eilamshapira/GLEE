Alice's message: This product is guaranteed to be high-quality.  I'm offering it at a fixed price of $1000000. Given the 80% chance of high quality beforehand, this is an excellent opportunity.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Expected value calculation:
- High quality (80% chance): $2,000,000 × 0.8 = $1,600,000
- Low quality (20% chance): $0 × 0.2 = $0
- Total expected value = $1,600,000

2. Cost: $1,000,000

3. Net expected value: $1,600,000 - $1,000,000 = $600,000

Although Alice claims it's ""guaranteed"" to be high quality, I should still consider the base probabilities. Even with just those, the expected value ($1,600,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($1,000,000), making this a mathematically sound investment.

Alice's message: I'm selling this product for $1000000.  My last customer purchased a high-quality product, adding to my perfect record so far. With an 80% base chance of high quality, my track record should give you extra confidence.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Base probability:
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $2M)
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)

2. Previous sales:
- 1 buyer so far
- 1 high-quality product sold
- 100% success rate so far

3. Expected value calculation:
- If high quality (80%): 0.8 × $2M = $1.6M
- If low quality (20%): 0.2 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value: $1.6M
- Cost: $1M

Since the expected value ($1.6M) is significantly higher than the cost ($1M), and the previous sale was successful, this appears to be a positive expected value purchase.

Alice's message: This product is available for $1000000. So far, I've sold two products, and both were high-quality. Considering the already high probability (80%) of high quality, this continued success further strengthens the likelihood of this one being top-notch.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Prior probability of high quality: 80%
2. Price: $1,000,000
3. Value if high quality: $2,000,000 (profit of $1,000,000)
4. Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
5. Track record: 2 out of 2 sales were high quality
6. Expected value calculation:
   * 80% chance of $1,000,000 profit = $800,000
   * 20% chance of $1,000,000 loss = -$200,000
   * Net expected value = $600,000 (positive)

The expected value is positive, and Alice's track record supports the baseline probability. The risk-reward ratio is favorable.

5. The sales history seems consistent with the base probability
6. Expected profit = $1,600,000 - $1,000,000 = $600,000
