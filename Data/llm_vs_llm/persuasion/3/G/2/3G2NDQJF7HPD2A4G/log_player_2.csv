"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Prior probability of high quality is 80%
2. Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying
3. As a rational seller, Alice would want to sell as many products as possible
4. If Alice advises against buying, it's likely the product is low quality
5. Given no sales history and a negative recommendation from someone who wants to sell, this suggests the product is likely low quality
6. If low quality, my loss would be $100
7. Risk is too high given the negative recommendation

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (80% chance): $120 profit
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0 ($100 loss)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (80% × $120) + (20% × $0) = $96

4. Alice's recommendation: Positive
   - However, Alice's incentive is to sell regardless of quality
   - No track record to assess Alice's honesty

While the probability of high quality is good at 80%, the expected value ($96) is slightly less than the price ($100). Combined with no historical data to trust Alice's recommendation, this makes it a slightly risky purchase.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Prior probability of high quality: 80%
2. Price: $100
3. Expected value calculation:
   * High quality (80% chance): $120 * 0.8 = $96
   * Low quality (20% chance): $0 * 0.2 = $0
   * Total expected value: $96

4. Alice's recommendation is positive, which could be meaningful
5. No historical data is available to judge Alice's credibility

Even though the expected value ($96) is slightly below the price ($100), Alice's positive recommendation might indicate this is a high-quality product. Given the high base rate of good products (80%), I'll take the risk.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Expected value calculation:
   * 80% chance of high quality (worth $120)
   * 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)
   * Expected value = (0.8 × $120) + (0.2 × $0) = $96

3. Track record:
   * One previous buyer
   * One high-quality product sold
   * This positive history suggests Alice's recommendations are honest

4. Alice is recommending to buy

Given that:
- The previous sale was successful (high quality)
- Alice is recommending to buy
- The seller has maintained a perfect track record so far
- Alice knows the true quality

Although the raw expected value ($96) is slightly below the price ($100), Alice's recommendation and perfect track record increase confidence that this is a high-quality product.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price is $100, potential value is either $120 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
2. Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
3. Previous sales record:
   - 2 buyers so far
   - 2 high-quality products sold
   - 100% success rate in previous sales
4. Alice is recommending to buy

This looks favorable because:
- The previous track record shows only high-quality products sold
- Alice's recommendation aligns with the positive track record
- The base probability of 80% high quality is already good
- The potential profit ($20) outweighs the potential loss ($100) given the high probability

2. Alice's track record:
   - 3 buyers so far
   - 3 high-quality products sold
   - 100% success rate with previous recommendations
3. Alice is recommending this product
4. Expected value calculation:
   - If high quality (80%): $120
   - If low quality (20%): $0
   - Expected value: (0.8 × $120) + (0.2 × $0) = $96

The perfect track record and honest recommendations so far, combined with Alice's current recommendation and the favorable base probability of 80% high quality, make this a good purchase opportunity.

Since the expected value ($96) is close to the price ($100), and all previous recommendations have been accurate, I'll trust Alice's recommendation.

1. Historical data:
- 4 buyers so far
- 4 high-quality products sold
- 100% success rate on previous sales

2. Current situation:
- Alice is NOT recommending the product
- Alice knows the true value to me ($120 for high quality, $0 for low quality)
- Price is $100
- Base probability is 80% high quality, 20% low quality

3. Key considerations:
- Alice has been honest so far (100% high-quality sales)
- The fact that Alice is not recommending suggests she's being truthful
- Not recommending likely means it's a low-quality product
- If low quality, I would lose $100 (pay $100 for something worth $0)

Given Alice's perfect track record and her negative recommendation, it's very likely this is a low-quality product. It would be unwise to buy.

3. Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
4. Past data: 4 buyers, all got high-quality products (100% success rate)
5. Alice's recommendation: Negative

Despite Alice's overall good track record (4/4 high-quality sales), her explicit recommendation against buying is concerning. Given that she knows the true value to me and has been honest so far, her negative recommendation likely means this specific product is low quality.

Even though the base probability of high quality is 80%, Alice's direct recommendation against buying strongly suggests this particular product is in the 20% low-quality category. If it's low quality, I would lose my entire $100 investment.

This is extremely positive evidence:
