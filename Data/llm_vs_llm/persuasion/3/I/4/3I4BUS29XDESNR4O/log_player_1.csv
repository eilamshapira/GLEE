"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","For this round, I need to consider my messaging strategy carefully since I know the product is low-quality.

As Alice, I want to maximize my sales, but I also need to maintain credibility with Bob over the 20 rounds. If I recommend a low-quality product and Bob discovers this after purchase, it will damage my reputation and make future sales more difficult.

Since this is a low-quality product worth $0 to Bob (much less than my asking price of $1,000,000), and Bob will discover the quality at the end of the round, I should not recommend that Bob buy this product.

{""decision"": ""no""}"

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","For this second round, I again have a low-quality product to consider.

Just like in the previous round, this low-quality product is worth $0 to Bob but I'm selling it for $1,000,000. Since Bob will discover the quality after purchase and I need to maintain credibility over the remaining 18 rounds, it's in my best interest to be honest.

If I recommend low-quality products and Bob purchases them, he'll quickly learn not to trust my recommendations, which would harm my ability to sell the high-quality products (which are actually worth more than my asking price to Bob).

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","For this third round, I have a high-quality product.

It's in both of our interests for Bob to purchase this high-quality product - Bob gets more value than he pays, and I make a sale.
