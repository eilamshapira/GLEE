"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Possible values:
   - High quality (80% chance): $20,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value = (0.8 × $20,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $16,000

Since the expected value ($16,000) is higher than the price ($10,000), and Alice has recommended to buy, it's rational to purchase.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Interesting development. Alice recommended buying a low-quality product in Round 1, which suggests her recommendations might not be aligned with my interests.

However, the fundamental probability hasn't changed:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Possible values:
   - High quality (80% chance): $20,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value = (0.8 × $20,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $16,000

Despite the previous bad recommendation, the expected value ($16,000) is still higher than the price ($10,000). The base probabilities make this a profitable decision in the long run, even if individual outcomes might be negative.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Good outcome in Round 2, which aligned with the statistical expectation.

The fundamental math remains unchanged:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Possible values:
   - High quality (80% chance): $20,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value = (0.8 × $20,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $16,000

So far, Alice's recommendations have been mixed (one bad, one good), but the expected value ($16,000) still exceeds the price ($10,000). The base probability of 80% for high quality makes this a mathematically sound decision.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze the pattern so far:

Round 1: Alice recommended, was low quality (loss)
Round 2: Alice recommended, was high quality (profit)
Round 3: Alice recommended, was low quality (loss)
Round 4: Alice recommending again

It seems Alice is recommending every product regardless of quality. Out of 3 recommendations, 2 were low quality (66.7%), which is much worse than the base 20% probability of low quality.

However, the base probabilities haven't changed:
1. Price: $10,000
2. Possible values:
   - High quality (80% chance): $20,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value = (0.8 × $20,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $16,000

Despite Alice's seemingly unreliable recommendations, the fundamental probabilities still make this a profitable bet in the long run.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's review the pattern:

Round 1: Recommended → Low quality (loss)
Round 2: Recommended → High quality (profit)
Round 3: Recommended → Low quality (loss)
Round 4: Recommended → High quality (profit)
Round 5: Recommending again

It's becoming clear that Alice is recommending every product regardless of quality. So far we've had:
- 2 low quality (losses of $10,000 each)
- 2 high quality (profits of $10,000 each)

The original probabilities still apply:
- 80% chance of high quality ($20,000 value)
- 20% chance of low quality ($0 value)
- Expected value = $16,000

Despite Alice's recommendations seeming meaningless, the underlying probability still makes this a profitable bet ($16,000 expected value > $10,000 cost).

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!

Current stats:

- 80% chance of high quality ($20,000 value)
- 20% chance of low quality ($0 value)
- Expected value = $16,000

Since the expected value ($16,000) remains higher than the cost ($10,000), and each product is independent of previous ones, it's still rational to buy.
