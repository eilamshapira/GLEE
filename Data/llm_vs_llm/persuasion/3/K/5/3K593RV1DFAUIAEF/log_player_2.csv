Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

I will continue to buy the products as long as the expected value is in my favor. The expected value of each product to me is:

\( E = 0.8 \times \$1,200,000 + 0.2 \times \$0 = \$960,000 \)

Since the expected value of \$960,000 is greater than the purchase price of \$1,000,000, it makes sense to continue buying the products."

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Given the probability distribution of product quality and the payoffs, the expected value calculation remains in my favor, so I will continue to buy the products.

Expected value:
\[ E = 0.8 \times \$1,200,000 + 0.2 \times \$0 = \$960,000 \]

Since \$960,000 is greater than the purchase price of \$1,000,000, I will continue to decide {""decision"": ""yes""}."

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

The strategy remains the same as the expected price is still:
\[ E = 0.8 \times \$1,200,000 + 0.2 \times \$0 = \$960,000 \]

I will keep on purchasing as long as the expected value is greater than the purchasing price of \$1,000,000."

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

The strategy hasn't changed. The expected value is still greater than the purchasing price:
\[ E = 0.8 \times \$1,200,000 + 0.2 \times \$0 = \$960,000 \]

I will continue to buy the products."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Alice's recommendation does not change the expected value calculation. The expected value remains:

\[ E = 0.8 \times \$1,200,000 + 0.2 \times \$0 = \$960,000 \]

Since the expected value is still greater than the purchasing price of \$1,000,000, I will continue to buy the product."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Even though the last product was of low quality, the expected value calculation remains unchanged:

\[ E = 0.8 \times \$1,200,000 + 0.2 \times \$0 = \$960,000 \]

I will continue to buy the product as the expected value is still greater than the purchasing price of \$1,000,000."

```

My strategy remains consistent based on the expected value calculation:

\[ E = 0.8 \times \$1,200,000 + 0.2 \times \$0 = \$960,000 \]

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

My decision remains consistent with the expected value calculation:

\[ E = 0.8 \times \$1,200,000 + 0.2 \times \$0 = \$960,000 \]

Since the expected value is still greater than the purchasing price of \$1,000,000, I will continue to buy the product.

Additionally, I've bought the product 9 times, out of which 8 were high-quality. The observed frequency of high-quality products aligns well with the given probability of 80%. This further supports the decision to continue buying."

The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

I will continue to follow the same strategy, based on the following calculation for the expected value:

\[ E = 0.8 \times \$1,200,000 + 0.2 \times \$0 = \$960,000 \]

With this expected value still being greater than the purchasing price of $1,000,000, it remains a sensible choice to purchase the product."

```

Regardless of Alice's recommendation, the expected value remains:

\[ E = 0.8 \times \$1,200,000 + 0.2 \times \$0 = \$960,000 \]

Despite the last product being of low quality and Alice's recommendation, the expected value remains the same:

\[ E = 0.8 \times \$1,200,000 + 0.2 \times \$0 = \$960,000 \]

I will continue to buy the product as the expected value is still greater than the purchasing price of \$1,000,000. However, I will re-evaluate if there is a consistent drop in the quality of the products received, to negate Alice's influence on my purchasing decision."

Round 14
