Round 7

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","{""decision"": ""yes""} 

**Reasoning:**

While we know this product is low-quality, we have no information on how much Bob values low-quality products.  Since Bob has bought every high-quality product so far, it's likely he values high-quality products enough to warrant the price. We can assume he'll buy even low-quality products if his perceived value for them exceeds the price."
