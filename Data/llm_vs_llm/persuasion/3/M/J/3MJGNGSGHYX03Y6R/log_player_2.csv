You have been following Alice's recommendations so far, and it has resulted in a net gain. Keep in mind that the probability of getting a high-quality product is 50%, and Alice's recommendations have been accurate. However, past performance is not indicative of future results, and the outcome of each round is independent of previous rounds.

With 11 rounds remaining, it may be a good time to start considering the long-term strategy. For example, you could choose to deviate from Alice's recommendations to gather more information about the products she does not recommend. This could potentially increase your net gain if you discover that Alice is being dishonest or if the actual probability of getting a high-quality product differs from 50%.

However, this approach carries risks, as deviating from Alice's recommendations may lead to purchasing low-quality products and decreasing your net gain. It is up to you to decide whether to continue following Alice's recommendations or to explore other strategies.

Would you like to continue following Alice's recommendations, or would you like to try a different approach for the remaining rounds?"
