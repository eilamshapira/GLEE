Alice's message: Hello! I have a fantastic product for you today. It's high-quality and I'm sure you'll love it.  This is a great opportunity to own something special at a reasonable price.  What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality (33.33%): $400
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (0.3333 × $400) + (0.6667 × $0) - $100 = $33.32

4. Considerations:
   - No sales history to verify Alice's reliability
   - Alice claims it's high quality, but she has incentive to sell
   - The expected value is slightly positive ($33.32)
   - The risk is significant ($100 loss if low quality)

While the expected value is positive, without any sales history to verify Alice's credibility and given the high risk of loss, it would be prudent to be cautious.

Alice's message: Hello! I have a great product for you today that I think you'll find very useful. It's a fantastic value at just $100.  What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $100
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $400
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (0.3333 × $400) + (0.6667 × $0) = $133.32

4. Considerations:
   - The expected value ($133.32) is higher than the price ($100)
   - No sales history to reference
   - Alice's message is vague and doesn't provide specific quality information

Even without prior sales data, the expected value exceeds the price, making this a mathematically favorable bet.

Alice's message: Hi there! I have a product that's perfect for you. It's a great deal at just $100. This one is a bit different from my usual offerings, but I'm sure you'll appreciate its unique qualities.  What do you think?

1. Price = $100
2. If high quality (33.33% chance): Value = $400 (profit of $300)
3. If low quality (66.67% chance): Value = $0 (loss of $100)

5. Expected value calculation:
   * (0.3333 × $400) + (0.6667 × $0) - $100 = $33.32

While the expected value is technically positive, there are concerning signals:
- Previous buyer bought but got a low-quality product
- Alice's message is vague and non-committal about quality
- ""Different from usual offerings"" could be a red flag

Given these warning signs, I'll err on the side of caution.
