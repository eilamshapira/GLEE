"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this decision.

Alice is recommending I buy the product. However, I need to consider whether her recommendation is reliable.

The base probability of a high-quality product is 80%. If the product is high-quality, I gain $1,250,000 - $1,000,000 = $250,000. If it's low-quality, I lose $1,000,000.

Expected value calculation:
0.8 × $250,000 + 0.2 × (-$1,000,000) = $200,000 - $200,000 = $0

Since this is the first round, I don't have any data on Alice's recommendation patterns yet. Based purely on the given probabilities, the expected value is neutral. However, Alice's recommendation might provide some additional information.

Given that Alice has chosen to recommend this product, I'll tentatively trust her recommendation for this first round.
