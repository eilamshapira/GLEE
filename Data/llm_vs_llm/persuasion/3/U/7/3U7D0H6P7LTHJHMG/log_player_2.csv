Alice's message: Hello there! I'm excited to offer you a product that meets the highest quality standards. I take great pride in selecting only the finest items, and many satisfied customers have already experienced the exceptional value we provide. This is a rare chance to get a product that I believe will exceed your expectations. I invite you to seize this opportunity—I'm confident you'll be delighted with your purchase!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully. 

Alice is offering a product for $100. Based on the game rules:
- 80% chance it's high quality (worth $200 to me)
- 20% chance it's low quality (worth $0 to me)
- Expected value = 0.8 × $200 + 0.2 × $0 = $160

Alice's message is very enthusiastic but contains no specific information about the product quality. The statistics show no previous sales, so I have no track record to evaluate.

Given the base probability of 80% for high quality and the expected value of $160 (which exceeds the $100 price), the rational choice is to buy.

Alice's message: Hello there! I’m happy to welcome you and offer another one of my carefully selected products. Every item in my collection brings its own unique benefits, and many of my customers have found great satisfaction in the distinct character these items provide. I take pride in building a trusted record with many happy buyers. I invite you to consider this opportunity—I'm confident you'll find value in what I offer!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether to purchase this product based on the information available.

Current statistics:
- 1 previous buyer purchased
- 1 high-quality product sold
- Product price: $100
- Product value: $200 if high quality, $0 if low quality
- Prior probability: 80% chance of high quality, 20% chance of low quality

Alice's message doesn't provide specific information about the quality of the current product. Without a direct recommendation about this product's quality, I should rely on the prior probability and existing statistics.

Since the expected value is: (0.8 × $200) + (0.2 × $0) = $160, which exceeds the $100 price, and the previous sale resulted in a high-quality product, purchasing seems reasonable.

Alice's message: Hello and welcome! I'm thrilled to present another product from our trusted collection. Our history of satisfied customers speaks volumes—many have praised the exceptional quality and value of our offerings. I personally stand behind the rigor of our selection process, ensuring that each item lives up to our firm reputation. Don't miss out on this opportunity to experience excellence firsthand!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

The statistics show that:
- 2 buyers purchased products
- Only 1 high-quality product was sold
- I would be the 3rd buyer

This means one of the previous buyers received a low-quality product, making the actual ratio of high-quality products sold only 50% (1 out of 2), which is lower than the expected 80%.

Alice's message is enthusiastic but doesn't specifically address the quality of the current product being offered to me. Without clear information about this specific product's quality, and given the concerning ratio of high-quality products in previous sales, I should decline.

I invite you to trust in our commitment to quality and to take advantage of this opportunity to own something truly exceptional.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the limited information provided, I need to make a decision while considering the risks.

The statistics show that 2 buyers purchased products, but only 1 high-quality product has been sold. This suggests that either one buyer received a low-quality product, or the outcome for one buyer is still unknown.

Alice's message is general and doesn't provide specific information about the current product's quality. Without a clear indication about this particular product, I need to rely on the base probability that 80% of products are high quality.

Given that the expected value calculation is (0.8 × $200) + (0.2 × $0) = $160, which exceeds the $100 price, I'll take the risk.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully. 

The product costs $100. If it's high quality (worth $200), I gain $100. If it's low quality (worth $0), I lose $100.

From the statistics, 3 buyers purchased products, and 2 were high quality. That's about 67% high quality among sold products, which is lower than the overall 80% chance of products being high quality.

Alice's message is very general and doesn't provide any specific information about my product's quality. There's no direct claim about whether my specific product is high or low quality.

Given that the expected value of a random product is:
0.8 × $200 + 0.2 × $0 - $100 = $160 - $100 = $60

Without any additional information suggesting my specific product is low quality, the expected return is positive.

The seller has sold 4 products, but only 2 were high quality (50%). This is significantly lower than the expected 80% high-quality rate. The seller's flowery marketing language doesn't provide any specific information about the current product's quality.

Given that the expected value calculation (0.5 × $200 + 0.5 × $0 = $100) exactly equals the price, and the actual quality rate seems worse than the expected rate, this doesn't appear to be a good deal.

Facts:

- Alice's recommendation is very positive but non-specific

The concerning point is that only 2 of 4 previously sold products were high quality (50%), which is lower than the base 80% chance of high quality. This suggests Alice's recommendations might not be reliable indicators of quality.

Given this information and the risk of getting a low-quality product worth $0 to me, I'll decline this offer.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, I need to analyze the situation carefully.

The seller claims this is a high-quality product, but the statistics show that out of 4 buyers who purchased, only 2 received high-quality products - a 50% rate, which is significantly lower than the 80% base rate of high-quality products in the game.

This suggests Alice's recommendations may not be reliable. If the true distribution is 80% high-quality, but only 50% of sold products were high-quality, this indicates potential misrepresentation in Alice's recommendations.

The expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high-quality ($200 value) = $160
- 20% chance of low-quality ($0 value) = $0
- Total expected value = $160
- Cost = $100
- Expected profit = $60

However, the actual quality rate of sold products (50%) would give an expected value of only $100 (equal to the cost), making this a break-even proposition at best.

Given this discrepancy, I'm not confident in the seller's representation.

Alice has sold products to 4 buyers so far, but only 2 were high quality. That's a 50% rate of high-quality products, which is lower than the 80% base rate mentioned in the game.

Alice's message is quite positive but doesn't specifically state the quality of my product. Given that only half of the previous purchases were high quality (despite the general probability being 80%), I'm skeptical about Alice's recommendations.

The expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 0.5 probability of high quality ($200 value) = $100 expected value
