Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Product price: $1,000,000
2. Expected value calculation:
   * 33.33% chance of high quality ($4,000,000) = $1,333,333
   * 66.67% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
   * Total expected value = $1,333,333

3. Alice recommends buying, which could be a positive signal
4. No previous sales history to base additional judgment on

Since the expected value ($1,333,333) is greater than the price ($1,000,000), even without considering Alice's recommendation, it's mathematically favorable to buy.

1. Expected value calculation:
- High quality (33.33%): $4,000,000
- Low quality (66.67%): $0
- Expected value = (0.3333 × $4,000,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $1,333,200

2. Price = $1,000,000

3. Additional information:
- Previous buyer bought and received a high-quality product
- Alice is recommending this product
- The previous success and current recommendation suggest Alice might be truthful

Given that:
- The expected value ($1,333,200) is higher than the price ($1,000,000)
- Alice has a perfect track record so far
- Alice is actively recommending the purchase
- There's evidence of Alice being honest with previous buyers

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:

   - Low quality: $0 (66.67% chance)
3. Previous statistics:
   - 2 buyers purchased
   - 2 high-quality products sold
   - Seems like Alice has been honest so far
4. Current situation:
   - Alice does NOT recommend buying
   - Given Alice's track record of selling only high-quality products and her honesty in recommendations, this strongly suggests the current product is low quality

Given Alice's negative recommendation and her demonstrated honesty (as shown by the previous sales all being high quality), it's very likely this product is low quality and worth $0.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Track record:
- 2 products sold so far
- Both were high-quality products (100% high-quality rate in sales)
- Alice has been honest with previous buyers

2. Current situation:
- Alice is NOT recommending this product
- Given Alice's perfect track record and her knowledge of the product's value to me
- Alice has no incentive to lie since she knows the true quality

3. Decision logic:
- Alice's recommendation is likely truthful based on her track record
- If she's not recommending it, it's probably a low-quality product
- A low-quality product would be worth $0 to me
- The price is $1,000,000
- This would result in a significant loss

1. Prior statistics:
- 2 buyers before me
- 2 high-quality products sold
- Alice has been 100% accurate so far (2/2 high-quality sales)

2. Current situation:
- Alice is NOT recommending the purchase
- Given her perfect track record, this strongly suggests the product is low quality
- If low quality, I would lose $1,000,000 (pay $1M for something worth $0)
- If high quality (against Alice's recommendation), I would gain $3,000,000

3. Decision factors:
- Alice's incentive is to sell, so a negative recommendation is particularly meaningful
- Her perfect track record adds credibility to her recommendation
- The negative recommendation likely means this is a low-quality product

Given Alice's credible track record and her negative recommendation, the product is most likely low quality, which would result in a significant loss.
