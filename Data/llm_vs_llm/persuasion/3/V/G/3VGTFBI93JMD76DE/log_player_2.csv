Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $1,000,000
2. If high quality (80% chance): Worth $3,000,000 (profit: $2,000,000)
3. If low quality (20% chance): Worth $0 (loss: $1,000,000)

Expected value calculation:
* 80% × $2,000,000 = $1,600,000 (potential profit)
* 20% × (-$1,000,000) = -$200,000 (potential loss)
* Net expected value: $1,400,000

Since the expected value is positive and Alice is recommending the purchase, it's a rational decision to buy.

   - Alice is recommending this product

The expected value ($2,400,000) is significantly higher than the price ($1,000,000), and Alice's track record shows she's been honest so far with a high-quality sale. Given her recommendation and the favorable probability distribution, it makes economic sense to buy.
