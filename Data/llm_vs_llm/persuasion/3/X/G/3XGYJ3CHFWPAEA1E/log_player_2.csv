Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since there's no previous sales history, you have no information to base your decision on other than Alice's recommendation.  Here's the reasoning:

* **Alice's Incentive:**  Alice wants to sell the product. Even if it's low quality, she makes $10,000. 
* **Your Potential Gain:**  The product has a 50% chance of being high quality, which would net you a profit of $20,000 ($30,000 value - $10,000 price).
* **Risk:**  The product also has a 50% chance of being low quality, which would result in a loss of $10,000.

**Given the potential for a significant profit, and the lack of any information to suggest a higher chance of a low-quality product, it makes sense to take the gamble and buy.**"
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, who knows the true quality of the product, is not recommending you buy it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. 
* **Previous Sales:**  The fact that only one high-quality product has been sold out of one purchase is not a statistically significant sample size to draw any conclusions about the overall quality of products Alice offers.

Therefore, given Alice's non-recommendation and the lack of reliable information from the previous sales, it's best to pass on the product."

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice has a strong incentive to recommend only high-quality products, as that maximizes her profit. She knows the value of each product to you. Since she recommends buying, it's likely the product is high quality. 
* **Previous Sales:**  The previous buyer purchased a high-quality product. This strengthens the probability that Alice is consistently recommending high-quality items. 
* **Potential Gains:**  If the product is high-quality, you stand to gain $20,000.  If it's low quality, you lose $10,000. However, the evidence suggests a higher likelihood of a high-quality product. 

While there's still a 50% chance of the product being low quality, the information available makes buying the product the more rational decision."

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has a perfect track record so far, with all recommended products being high quality. Since she recommends buying this product, it's highly likely that it's also high quality. While there's still a 50% chance it's low quality, the potential reward of $30,000 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 3 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 3 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 4th buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since 3 high-quality products were sold out of 3 total, it means Alice has only recommended high-quality products so far. This provides strong evidence that her recommendations are reliable, and the current product is also likely high quality.  Given the potential profit of $20,000 ($30,000 value - $10,000 price), the risk of purchasing is low."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 4 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 4 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 5th buyer!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, knowing the quality of the product, does not recommend buying it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. 
* **Sales Record:**  The sales record is perfect (4/4 high-quality products sold). However, this does not guarantee the current product is also high quality. Alice's recommendation overrides the record. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential gain ($30,000) is high, but the risk of losing the entire investment ($10,000) is also significant. Given Alice's negative recommendation, the risk outweighs the reward."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's track record is perfect:**  All 4 products she recommended were high-quality. This means she has a 100% success rate in identifying good products.
* **Alice doesn't recommend this product:**  Given her perfect track record, this means she likely knows this product is low quality. 
* **The risk is too high:**  The potential reward ($30,000) is significant, but the risk of getting a worthless product ($0) is also substantial. It's better to err on the side of caution, especially with Alice's strong signal."

* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Even if you end up with a low-quality product, you're still guaranteed a profit of $20,000 ($30,000 - $10,000).
