**Reasoning:**

* **Unknown Value:** We don't have any prior information about the product's actual quality distribution since no products have been sold yet.
* **Negative Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation not to buy the product is a strong indicator of low quality. While she doesn't know your personal valuations, she likely bases her recommendation on some general market assessment.
* **Risk Aversion:**  Given the high probability (66.67%) of the product being low quality and worth $0 to you, combined with the negative recommendation, it's too risky to buy.  

It's better to wait for more information or a more favorable recommendation."

Explanation: Even though Alice recommends buying the product, it's impossible to determine if her recommendation is based on the product's actual quality or if she's just trying to make a sale. Since there's no previous sales data to rely on, the odds of getting a high-quality product (33.33%) don't outweigh the risk of losing money on a low-quality product (66.67%).
