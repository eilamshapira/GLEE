{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While there's a risk of getting a low-quality product, the expected value of buying is positive:

* **Expected Value = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality)**
* **Expected Value = (0.8 * $12,500) + (0.2 * $0) = $10,000**

Since the expected value ($10,000) is equal to the price of the product, it's a neutral decision. However, given Alice's recommendation and the lack of any negative information, it's reasonable to assume she's more likely to recommend a good product. Therefore, it's worth taking the risk."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, knowing the product's true quality, recommends buying it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high-quality.
* **Limited Data:** While the sample size is small (only one previous sale), the fact that the sold product was high-quality suggests a positive trend.
* **Risk/Reward:** Even with a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain ($12,500) outweighs the potential loss ($0).  

Therefore, based on the available information, the decision is to buy the product."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has a 100% success rate so far. This strongly suggests she only recommends products she knows are high quality. While there's still a theoretical 20% chance the product could be low quality, the evidence overwhelmingly points towards it being high quality.  The potential reward ($12,500) outweighs the risk."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong track record:** The seller has sold 5 products, and all of them were high quality. This suggests that the seller is either very lucky or is deliberately selecting high-quality products to offer.
* **Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, and she knows the true quality.  This is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality. 

While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the current evidence heavily favors the product being high quality. The potential payoff of $12,500 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000."

{""decision"": ""no""}

* **Perfect track record:**  The previous buyers all received high-quality products. This suggests Alice is being extra cautious with her recommendation and likely knows the current product is low quality.

While there's always a chance the product is high quality, the odds are stacked against it, and the potential loss outweighs the potential gain."
