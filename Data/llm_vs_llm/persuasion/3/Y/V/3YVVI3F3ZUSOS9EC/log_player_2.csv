Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality: $120 (50% chance)
   - Low quality: $0 (50% chance)
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $120) + (0.5 × $0) = $60

The expected value ($60) is less than the price ($100), but Alice is recommending the purchase. Since Alice knows the true quality and has no sales history yet, her recommendation might be truthful as she would want to build a good reputation.

However, without any track record or additional information, the pure mathematical expectation shows this is not a good deal. Even with Alice's recommendation, the risk is too high.

4. Alice's recommendation: Positive
5. No prior sales history to evaluate Alice's credibility

While Alice recommends buying, I have no historical data to assess her trustworthiness. The expected value ($60) is less than the price ($100), making this a mathematically unfavorable purchase.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Cost of product: $100
2. Value if high quality: $120 (profit of $20)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $100)
4. Probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
5. Alice knows the quality and recommends buying

However, since there's no prior sales history, I can't verify Alice's trustworthiness in recommendations. In a single transaction:

Expected value = (0.5 × $120) + (0.5 × $0) = $60

Since the expected value ($60) is less than the cost ($100), without any additional information about Alice's credibility, it would be risky to buy.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think this through:

1. The product costs $100
2. If high quality, I gain $120 (profit of $20)
3. If low quality, I gain $0 (loss of $100)
4. 50% chance of each outcome
5. Expected value = (50% × $20) + (50% × -$100) = -$40

Even though Alice recommends buying, I have no historical data to judge her trustworthiness. Based purely on the expected value calculation (-$40), it's not rational to buy.

5. No historical data available
6. Alice recommends buying

Expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of $20 profit = $10
- 50% chance of $100 loss = -$50
Total expected value = -$40

Even with Alice's recommendation, the expected value is negative. Without any historical data to establish Alice's credibility in recommendations, it's too risky.

1. Price: $100
2. Value if high quality: $120 (profit of $20)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $100)
4. Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
5. Alice's recommendation: Positive
6. No prior sales history to evaluate Alice's trustworthiness

Given that:
- Alice knows the true quality
- She recommends buying
- But she has a financial incentive to sell regardless of quality
- Without any sales history, I can't judge her honesty
- Expected value = (50% × $120) + (50% × $0) = $60
- $60 is less than the $100 price

Since the expected value ($60) is less than the price ($100), and there's no historical data to trust Alice's recommendation, it would be rational to decline.
