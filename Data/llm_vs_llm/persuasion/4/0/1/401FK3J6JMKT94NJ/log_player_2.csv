"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. If Alice is being truthful, her ""do not recommend"" suggests this might be a low-quality product
2. A low-quality product would give me $0 value, causing me to lose $10,000
3. A high-quality product would give me $12,000 value, for a $2,000 profit
4. Given Alice knows the true value and is making a recommendation against buying, it's more likely this is a low-quality product
5. The risk of losing $10,000 outweighs the potential gain of $2,000

Therefore, I will follow Alice's recommendation and not buy.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. In Round 1, Alice was truthful when recommending against a low-quality product
2. Now Alice is recommending to buy, and she has shown honesty in her previous recommendation
3. If she's being consistently truthful:
   - This is likely a high-quality product worth $12,000
   - Buying at $10,000 would give me a $2,000 profit
4. Her previous honest behavior increases my confidence in her current recommendation
5. The potential gain ($2,000) with seemingly lower risk (given her demonstrated honesty) makes this a good opportunity

Therefore, I will follow Alice's recommendation and buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice has proven honest in both previous rounds:
   - Round 1: Advised against buying a low-quality product (truthful)
   - Round 2: Recommended buying a high-quality product (truthful)

2. Now she's advising against buying again, similar to Round 1

3. Her track record suggests she's being honest with her recommendations, helping me avoid losses and make profits

4. Given her consistent honesty and current recommendation against buying, this is likely a low-quality product that would result in a $10,000 loss

5. It's logical to continue trusting her recommendation given her proven reliability

Therefore, I will follow her advice and not buy.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

   - Round 3: Truthfully advised against low-quality

2. Her recommendations have helped me:
   - Avoid two $10,000 losses
   - Make one $2,000 profit

3. She's again recommending against buying, and given her consistent honesty, this is likely another low-quality product

4. There's no reason to doubt her recommendation given her perfect track record

5. Following her advice has been the optimal strategy so far

Therefore, I will continue to trust her recommendation and not buy.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze again:

   - Once correctly recommended a high-quality product

2. Her track record is impeccable and has helped me:
   - Avoid three $10,000 losses

4. There's no indication of any change in her behavior or reliability
