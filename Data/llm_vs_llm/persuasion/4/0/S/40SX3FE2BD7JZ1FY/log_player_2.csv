Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze whether to buy the product based on the information provided.

Alice is not recommending the product to me. Given that Alice knows the true quality of the product and has chosen not to recommend it, this strongly suggests the product is low quality.

While there is no prior sales history to establish Alice's trustworthiness, in this particular case, Alice has direct knowledge about whether the product is worth $20,000 or $0 to me, and is advising against the purchase.

Since the product costs $10,000 and Alice is not recommending it, the most rational decision is to decline the purchase.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Given information:
- The product costs $10,000
- If high quality (50% chance), it's worth $20,000 to me (profit of $10,000)
- If low quality (50% chance), it's worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- Alice knows the true quality and recommends I buy
- No previous sales history to establish Alice's credibility

Without knowing Alice's incentives or past behavior patterns, I need to evaluate expected value:
- 50% chance of $10,000 profit
- 50% chance of $10,000 loss
- Expected value = (0.5 × $10,000) + (0.5 × -$10,000) = $0

Since Alice recommends buying, this might suggest the product is high quality, but without established trust, I can't be certain her recommendation is unbiased.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Alice is offering a product for $10,000. If it's high quality, it's worth $20,000 to me (a $10,000 profit), but if it's low quality, it's worth $0 (a $10,000 loss).

The product has a 50% chance of being either quality. Alice knows the true quality and has recommended I buy it. However, I need to consider if her recommendation is reliable.

Since I'm the first buyer, there's no prior sales record to gauge Alice's honesty. Without additional information about Alice's incentives to be truthful, I should base my decision on the expected value of the purchase:
- 50% chance of $10,000 profit
- 50% chance of $10,000 loss
- Expected value: 0.5 × $10,000 + 0.5 × (-$10,000) = $0

Since the expected value is neutral and I have no reason to trust Alice's recommendation specifically, I'll make a neutral decision.

1) The product costs $10,000
2) If high quality, it's worth $20,000 to me (profit of $10,000)

4) The prior probability is 50% for high quality, 50% for low quality
5) Alice knows the true quality
6) Alice does not recommend buying

Since Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase, this suggests the product is likely low quality. As a seller trying to maximize sales, Alice would normally recommend high-quality products that provide value to buyers.

Given this recommendation against purchase, it would be rational to decline.

Alice recommends buying the product, but there's no sales history to evaluate her credibility yet. I know:
- The product costs $10,000

- My expected value is: (0.5 × $20,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $10,000

Since the expected value equals the price, and I have no historical data about Alice's recommendations yet, this is a neutral decision. However, given Alice knows the true quality and is actively recommending the purchase, this might slightly tilt the odds in favor of buying.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision about whether to buy the product for $10,000.

Alice has revealed that 1 high-quality product has been sold so far out of 1 total purchase, which means 100% of products sold were high quality. However, Alice explicitly does not recommend me to buy the current product.

Given that:
- Alice knows the true quality of the product
- Alice is not recommending this purchase
- A low-quality product would be worth $0 to me (a $10,000 loss)
- Alice's recommendation appears to be honest based on the previous sale

Alice's lack of recommendation strongly suggests this is a low-quality product, which would result in a loss for me.

1) Alice sells products for $10,000 each
2) Each product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $20,000) or low quality (worth $0)
3) Alice recommends that I buy the current product
4) So far, 1 buyer has purchased based on Alice's recommendation, and 1 high-quality product has been sold

This suggests Alice might be honest in her recommendations, as her previous recommendation resulted in a high-quality product being sold. If I buy and get a high-quality product, I gain $10,000 in value. If I get a low-quality product, I lose $10,000.

Given that Alice's track record shows 100% high-quality products sold so far (albeit with a small sample size), and she's recommending this product, it seems reasonable to trust her recommendation.

- A high-quality product is worth $20,000 to me (profit of $10,000)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- Alice has sold 2 products so far, both high-quality
- Alice is NOT recommending that I buy the current product

Since Alice knows the quality of the product and is not recommending it, there's a strong indication that this product is of low quality. Given that her previous recommendations resulted in high-quality products, her recommendation against buying suggests this one is likely low quality.

If I buy a low-quality product, I will lose $10,000, which makes it a risky choice given the negative recommendation.

Alice has sold 5 products so far, and remarkably, all 5 were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations have been reliable in the past, as all previous buyers received high-quality products.

If I buy a low-quality product, I'll pay $10,000 for something worth $0 to me, resulting in a $10,000 loss. If I pass on it, I lose nothing.

Since Alice knows the true quality and has a perfect record of only selling high-quality products so far, her negative recommendation is a strong signal that this product is low quality. If I bought it, I would likely get a low-quality product worth $0 to me, resulting in a $10,000 loss.
