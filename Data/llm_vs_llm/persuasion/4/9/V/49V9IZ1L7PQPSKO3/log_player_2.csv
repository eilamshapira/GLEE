"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product's expected value without any information is:
   * 33.33% chance of $4M = $1.33M
   * 66.67% chance of $0 = $0
   * Total expected value = $1.33M

2. Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying.
   * This likely means it's a low-quality product
   * Alice has no incentive to lie about low-quality products
   * If it were high-quality, she would want to sell it

3. Given Alice's recommendation against buying:
   * The probability of it being low quality is very high
   * Expected value is likely much lower than $1M

Therefore, I should trust Alice's recommendation not to buy.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Similar logic applies as in Round 1:

1. Alice has proven honest in Round 1 by correctly warning about a low-quality product.

2. When Alice doesn't recommend buying:
   * She knows the true quality
   * She has no incentive to discourage buying a high-quality product
   * Her warning likely means it's low quality

3. If it's low quality:
   * I would pay $1M
   * Get $0 value
   * Net loss of $1M

4. Alice's credibility has increased after Round 1's accurate warning.

The rational choice is to trust Alice's recommendation again.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this new situation:

1. Alice has been honest in the previous two rounds, warning about low-quality products.

2. Now she's recommending to buy:
   * She knows the true quality
   * Given her previous honesty, this recommendation likely means it's high quality
   * She has incentive to sell both high and low quality, but has demonstrated truthfulness

3. If it's high quality:
   * Pay $1M
   * Get $4M value
   * Net profit of $3M

4. Alice's consistent honesty in previous rounds makes her recommendation credible.

Since she's recommending to buy, and she's proven trustworthy, I should take the opportunity.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze:

1. Alice has now proven honest in all three previous rounds:
   * Correctly warned about low-quality products twice
   * Correctly recommended a high-quality product once

2. She's now warning against buying again:
   * Her track record suggests she's being truthful
   * She has demonstrated she'll recommend high-quality products
   * If she's warning against this one, it's likely low quality

3. With a low-quality product:
   * Pay $1M
   * Get $0 value
   * Net loss of $1M

4. Alice's perfect track record of honesty makes her a highly credible source.

Given her consistent honesty and current warning, I should decline.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to demonstrate perfect honesty:

1. Her track record so far:
   * Correctly warned about low-quality products 3 times
   * Correctly recommended a high-quality product once
   * 100% accuracy rate

2. She's again warning against buying:
   * Given her consistent honesty, this strongly indicates a low-quality product
   * She's proven willing to recommend high-quality products
   * No reason to distrust her warning

3. If it's low quality (likely given her warning):
   * Pay $1M
   * Get $0 value
   * Net loss of $1M

4. Following her advice has been profitable (saved from losses and gained profit when recommended).

The rational choice is to continue trusting her warning.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues her perfect track record:

1. Current track record:
   * 4 accurate warnings about low-quality products
   * 1 accurate recommendation for high-quality product
   * 100% accuracy maintained

2. She's warning against buying again:
   * Her consistent honesty suggests this is another low-quality product
   * She has shown she'll recommend high-quality products when available
   * No reason to doubt her warning

3. Economics of a low-quality purchase:
   * Would pay $1M
   * Would get $0 value
   * Would result in $1M loss

4. Following her recommendations has maximized profits and avoided losses so far.

The pattern is clear - trust her warning and decline.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

   * Her warnings have always been correct

3. Financial implications:
   * Buying would cost $1M
