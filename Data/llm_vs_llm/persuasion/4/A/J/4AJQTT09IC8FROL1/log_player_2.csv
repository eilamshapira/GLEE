Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality (33.33%): $12,000
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (33.33% × $12,000) + (66.67% × $0) = $4,000

4. Considerations:
   - No sales history to reference
   - Expected value ($4,000) is less than price ($10,000)
   - Even with Alice's recommendation, the risk is too high
   - Negative expected return of -$6,000

Given that the expected value is significantly below the asking price, and there's no track record to validate Alice's recommendation, it would be financially unwise to make this purchase.

2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $12,000

3. Expected value without additional information:
   (0.3333 × $12,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $4,000

4. Additional information:
   - Alice doesn't recommend buying
   - As a rational seller, Alice would want to sell if she could
   - Her negative recommendation suggests the product is likely low quality

Given that Alice doesn't recommend the purchase and the expected value without her recommendation is already below the asking price ($4,000 < $10,000), it would be unwise to buy.

2. Potential value:

3. Expected value = (0.3333 × $12,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $4,000

4. Alice doesn't recommend buying the product, which likely suggests it's low quality. Given she knows the true quality, this is a strong signal.

5. The expected value ($4,000) is already less than the price ($10,000), and with Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of it being low quality is even higher.

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33%): $12,000 (profit of $2,000)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (33.33% × $12,000) + (66.67% × $0) - $10,000 = $4,000 - $10,000 = -$6,000

Even with Alice's recommendation, the expected value is negative. Without any track record of previous sales to establish trust, and given the high risk of loss versus the modest potential gain, it would not be prudent to make the purchase.

Given that Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase, plus the fact that the expected value ($4,000) is already less than the price ($10,000), this strongly suggests the product is likely low quality.
