Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision about whether to buy the product or not.

Alice does not recommend that I buy the product, which suggests it might be low quality. Since:
- High-quality product is worth $300 to me (good deal at $100)
- Low-quality product is worth $0 to me (bad deal at $100)
- Alice knows the true quality
- Alice is not recommending the product

Given that Alice knows the product quality and is explicitly not recommending the purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If I buy it, I would likely pay $100 for something worth $0 to me.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze whether to buy the product based on the information given.

Alice recommends buying the product, but I don't know if her recommendation is reliable since there's no previous sales record to evaluate her trustworthiness.

The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $300) and a 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0). The price is $100.

Expected value calculation:
0.5 × $300 + 0.5 × $0 = $150

Since the expected value ($150) is greater than the price ($100), it makes mathematical sense to buy.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision about buying this product.

I see that Alice doesn't recommend the product. Given that:
- The price is $100
- High-quality products are worth $300 (giving a profit of $200)
- Low-quality products are worth $0 (resulting in a loss of $100)
- Alice has sold 1 product so far, and it was high quality
- Alice knows the true quality of the product
- Alice is not recommending this product

Since Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending it, and considering her previous recommendation led to a high-quality sale, it's reasonable to trust her recommendation. This product is likely low quality, which would result in a loss for me.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at the statistics, 1 buyer has purchased based on Alice's recommendations, and 1 high-quality product has been sold. This suggests that Alice has been truthful in her recommendations so far, as the previously sold product was indeed high quality.

Given that:
- The product has a 50% chance of being high quality
- A high-quality product is worth $300 to me
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me
- The price is $100
- Alice is recommending that I buy the product
- Alice's previous recommendation led to a high-quality product being sold

Alice has a perfect track record so far, and she's recommending I buy. The expected value of following her recommendation is positive: (0.5 × $300) - $100 = $50, but her track record and current recommendation suggest the probability of this being a high-quality product is likely higher than 50%.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze the information I have to make a decision.

Alice has sold 2 products so far, and both were high-quality products. This suggests Alice has been honest with previous buyers.

However, Alice is now explicitly recommending that I do NOT buy the current product. Since Alice knows the true quality of each product, this recommendation likely means the current product is low quality.

Given that:
- The price is $100
- A high-quality product would give me $300 value (good deal)
- A low-quality product would give me $0 value (bad deal)
- Alice, who knows the quality, is advising against purchase

I should trust Alice's recommendation in this case, as her track record shows honesty with previous buyers.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether to buy the product based on the information provided.

Facts:
- Product price: $100
- High-quality value to me: $300
- Low-quality value to me: $0
- Prior probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
- Alice's sales record: 2 buyers so far, 2 high-quality products sold
- Alice is recommending that I buy the product

Analysis:
Alice has a perfect track record so far - all products sold were high quality. This suggests her recommendations may be reliable. If I purchase a high-quality product, my expected profit is $200 ($300 value - $100 price). If it's low quality, I lose $100.

Given Alice's recommendation and her perfect track record, the product is more likely to be high quality, making this a positive expected value decision.

Alice has sold 3 products so far, and all 3 were high quality. This suggests Alice has been honest in her recommendations so far. The fact that Alice is now recommending that I do NOT buy the product is significant.

Since Alice knows the true quality of the product and is advising against buying it, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. Given that a low-quality product is worth $0 to me but costs $100, buying it would result in a loss.

Alice's track record indicates her recommendations have been reliable, so I should trust this recommendation as well.

3) Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality initially.
4) The product costs $100, and is worth either $300 (high quality) or $0 (low quality).

Since Alice has only sold high-quality products so far and now specifically recommends I NOT buy this product, this strongly suggests the current product is low quality. Alice appears to be giving honest recommendations based on her track record.

If I buy a low-quality product, I would lose $100. If I pass, I lose nothing.

Given that Alice has only sold high-quality products so far (4 out of 4), her recommendations seem reliable.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

- The product costs $100
- A high-quality product is worth $300 to me, giving a profit of $200
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me, resulting in a loss of $100
- The prior probability is 50% for high quality and 50% for low quality
- Alice has sold 4 products, and all 4 were high quality
- Alice is recommending that I buy this product

Alice's perfect track record suggests that her recommendations are reliable. With 4 out of 4 previous sales being high quality, and Alice now recommending this product, it's reasonable to infer this product is likely high quality as well.

The expected value calculation supports buying:
- 50% chance of $200 profit (high quality)  
- 50% chance of $100 loss (low quality)
- Expected value: 0.5 × $200 - 0.5 × $100 = $50 (positive)

Given Alice's track record and recommendation, the probability of high quality is likely higher than 50%, making the expected value even more favorable.

Given that all previous buyers received accurate recommendations for high-quality products, and Alice is recommending I buy, this suggests Alice is providing honest recommendations. The expected value calculation is:

If I trust Alice's recommendation:

Since the expected value is positive and Alice's track record shows perfect reliability so far, I should buy the product.

Alice is offering a product for $100, which is worth either $300 (high quality) or $0 (low quality) to me.

Looking at Alice's track record:
