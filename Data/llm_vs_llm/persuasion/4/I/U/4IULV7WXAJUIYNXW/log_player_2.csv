{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No prior information:** There is no historical data on product quality, and Alice's recommendation is the only available information. 
* **Alice's incentive:** Alice benefits from selling the product, regardless of its quality. Therefore, her recommendation should be taken with a grain of salt.
* **80% chance of high quality:** The odds are in your favor that the product is high quality.  While there's a risk of it being low quality, the potential reward of $1,200,000 outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000.

**Conclusion:**  It's a gamble, but the potential reward makes it worthwhile to take the chance."

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. Since she knows the quality of the product, this recommendation carries significant weight.
* **Limited Data:**  While only one previous buyer purchased a product, it was a high-quality one. This limited data is not enough to draw definitive conclusions about Alice's overall recommendation accuracy.
* **Potential Gain:** The potential gain from buying a high-quality product ($1,200,000 - $1,000,000 = $200,000) significantly outweighs the potential loss from buying a low-quality product ($0 - $1,000,000 = -$1,000,000).

**Given the high recommendation and the potential for a substantial gain, it makes sense to accept Alice's recommendation and purchase the product.**"

* **Risk:** Even though there's a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain significantly outweighs the risk.

**Therefore, it's a rational decision to buy the product.**"
