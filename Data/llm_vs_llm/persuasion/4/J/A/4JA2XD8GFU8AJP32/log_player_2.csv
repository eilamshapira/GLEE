"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided:

1. Alice does not recommend the product
2. Products have a 33.33% chance of being high quality (worth $1,200,000 to me)
3. Products have a 66.67% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me)

Without any additional information about why Alice isn't recommending it, I should assume the product follows the base probability distribution. The expected value would be:
0.3333 × $1,200,000 + 0.6667 × $0 = $400,000

Since the price is $1,000,000 and the expected value is only $400,000, I should not buy this product.
