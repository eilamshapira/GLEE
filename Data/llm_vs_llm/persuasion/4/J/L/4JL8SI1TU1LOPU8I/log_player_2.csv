"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information, I need to make a decision based on expected value.

Alice knows the true quality of the product and is making a recommendation. However, I don't know if Alice's incentives align with mine - she wants to sell products regardless of quality, while I only want high-quality ones.

The expected value of a random product is:
(0.3333 × $400) + (0.6667 × $0) = $133.32

Since the price is $100, a random product has positive expected value. But Alice's recommendation might contain useful information or might be biased toward selling regardless of quality.

Without additional information about Alice's recommendation patterns, I should follow the expected value calculation.
