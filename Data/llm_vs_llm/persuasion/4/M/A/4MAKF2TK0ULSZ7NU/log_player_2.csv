"Round 1
Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product for you today! It's a unique opportunity that you won't want to miss. The value it can bring to your collection is immense. What do you say, are you in?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice hasn't revealed whether the product is high quality or low quality, which should happen according to the rules of our game. Without that information, I can only assume the product has the original 50% chance of being high quality, making its expected value to me $1,000,000 (0.5 × $2,000,000 + 0.5 × $0), which equals the asking price. This would leave me with zero expected profit.

Round 2
Alice's message: Bob, today's product is truly exceptional! It's a rare find that could significantly enhance your portfolio. Don't miss out on this chance to add something special to your collection. Are you ready to make the purchase?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice still hasn't revealed the quality of the product as required by the game rules. According to the rules, she should ""randomly choose one of the products she is selling, reveal its true quality, and then send you a recommendation."" Since she hasn't explicitly revealed whether this product is high or low quality, I have to assume it's still a 50/50 chance, making the expected value equal to the price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice still hasn't explicitly revealed the quality of the product as required by the game rules. She should be randomly choosing a product and revealing its true quality before making a recommendation, but she's not doing that in her messages.
