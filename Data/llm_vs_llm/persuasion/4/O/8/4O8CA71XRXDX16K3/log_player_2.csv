"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this. 

Alice is a seller, and she wants to sell products. She has revealed the true quality of a product and recommended that I buy it.

If I buy the product for $100, there's an 80% chance it's high quality (worth $300 to me, so $200 profit) and a 20% chance it's low quality (worth $0 to me, so $100 loss).

Expected value = 0.8 × $200 - 0.2 × $100 = $160 - $20 = $140

Since the expected value is positive, it's rational for me to buy.
