Alice's message: Hello! Welcome to my store. I'm thrilled to report that I've now sold 3 out of 3 products, and all of them have been high-quality. My success rate is still a perfect 100%.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Historical performance:
- 3 buyers so far
- 3 high-quality products sold
- 100% success rate

2. Base probability:
- 80% chance of high quality ($120 value)
- 20% chance of low quality ($0 value)

3. Expected value calculation:
- If high quality (80%): $120 - $100 = $20 profit
- If low quality (20%): $0 - $100 = -$100 loss
- Expected value = (0.8 × $20) + (0.2 × -$100) = $16 - $20 = -$4

4. Additional considerations:
- Perfect track record so far (3/3)
- The seller appears confident and transparent
- However, past performance doesn't guarantee future results

While the track record is impressive, the expected value is still slightly negative based on the base probabilities. The risk of losing $100 outweighs the potential gain of $20.

Alice's message: Hello! I want to be transparent with you - I've had a great run so far, with 3 out of 3 products sold being high-quality. However, I know that my overall probability of selling high-quality products is 80%, which means that not every product can be a winner. I'm not making any claims about the quality of the product I'm offering you today, but I will say that the price of $100 is still a great value if you're willing to take on some uncertainty. If you're feeling lucky or are looking for a potential bargain, this might be the opportunity for you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Known statistics:
- Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Previous sales: 3 out of 3 were high quality
- Price: $100
- Value: $120 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)

2. Analysis:
- Alice's track record is perfect so far
- Alice's message is notably cautious and non-committal
- The expected value calculation:
  * 80% chance of $120 value = $96
  * 20% chance of $0 value = $0
  * Total expected value = $96
  * Cost = $100

3. Decision factors:
- Expected value ($96) is less than the cost ($100)
- Alice's careful wording suggests possible low quality
- Perfect previous record might mean we're ""due"" for a low-quality item

3. Track Record Analysis:
- 3 sales, all high quality
- This shows a good track record

- The expected value ($96) is less than the price ($100)

The probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%, but I've had a few instances where buyers didn't purchase or the product wasn't high-quality.

The expected value ($96) is slightly less than the asking price ($100), and the seller's transparency about their mixed track record suggests they're being honest about potential risks.

1. Prior Statistics:
- 6 total attempts
- 3 high-quality products sold
- Success rate of sold products: 100% (3/3 were high quality)
- Base probability of high quality remains at 80%

2. Risk Analysis:
- Cost: $100
- Potential value: $120 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Expected value = (0.8 × $120) + (0.2 × $0) = $96

3. Evaluation:
- Alice's track record shows only high-quality sales so far
- However, the expected value ($96) is less than the price ($100)
- There's still a 20% risk of getting a low-quality product
- The seller's message seems promotional and doesn't provide additional quality assurance

Based on this analysis, since the expected value is less than the price and there's no additional information to increase confidence in the product's quality, the rational decision would be to not purchase.
