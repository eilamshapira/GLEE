Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes""}

Let's keep track of the net gain

Net gain = (Value of the product - Purchase price of the product) = (400 - 100) + (400 - 100)  =  $600"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}

Net gain = 400 - 100 + 400 - 100  =  $600"

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes""}

Let's update the net gain assuming you buy the product.

If it is high quality:

Net gain  = 400 - 100 + 400 - 100 + 400 - 100  =  $900

If it is low quality net gain would be

Net gain  = 400 - 100 + 400 - 100 + 0 - 100  =  $400"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes""}

If it is high quality:
Net gain  = 400 - 100 + 400 - 100 + 400 - 100 + 400 -100 =  $1200

If it is low quality net gain would be

Net gain  = 400 - 100 + 400 - 100 + 400 - 100 + 0 -100 =  $700"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 8
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}

Net gain = 400 - 100 + 400 - 100 + 400 - 100 + 400 -100 = $1200

So far, you have bought 4 products, 3 of which Alice has recommended to you. All the products you bought were high quality. The one Alice did not recommend was low quality."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes""}

Potential net gain:

High quality: Net gain  = 1600
Low quality: Net gain = 1100"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 10
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}

Net gain  = 400 - 100 *(5) + 400 *(4) =  $1600

You have followed Alice's recommendations so far and it is working out well."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 11
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}

Alice has been reliable so far. Every time Alice recommended a product, it was high quality, and every time Alice did not recommend a product, it was low quality. It makes sense to continue following Alice's recommendations."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 12
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes""}

So far, Alice's recommendations have been accurate. Every time you followed Alice's recommendation, you ended up making a profit."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 13
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}

Net gain =  400*6 - 100*6 = $2400

Alice's recommendations have been accurate 100% of the time so far. There is no reason to stop following them."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 14
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}

There have been 14 rounds so far. Alice has recommended 6 times, and not recommended 8 times. Every time Alice has recommended a product, it has been high quality. Every time Alice has not recommended a product, it has been low quality. There is no reason to doubt Alice's recommendations."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 15
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes""}

You are following the strategy of agreeing with Alice's recommendations, and so far it has worked every time. It is logical to continue with this strategy.

Potential net gain:

High quality: Net gain  = 400*7 - 100*7 = $2800
Low quality: Net gain = 400*6 - 100*7  = $2300"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 16
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}

Alice's recommendations continue to be reliable. With only 5 rounds left, it's sensible to continue trusting Alice's recommendations.

Net gain  = 400*7 - 100*7 = $2800"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 17
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes""}

With only 4 rounds left it is very likely that the current product is of high quality, given that Alice's recommendations have been accurate 100% of the time so far.

If it is high quality:

Net gain  = 400*8 - 100*8 = $3200

I will calculate the probability of the product being high quality, using Laplace's rule of succession, which is more suitable than assuming 100% probability.

P(H) = ( number of high quality recommendations given by Alice + 1) / (Total number of recommendations given by Alice +2)

P(H) = (7+1)/(15+2) = 8/17

P(H) is around 47%"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 18
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes""}

Net gain so far =  3200

P(H) = (8+1)/(16+2) = 9/18 = 50%

The probability of the product being high-quality went back to 50%.

If it is high quality:

Net gain  = 400*9 - 100*9=$3600

If it is low quality:

Net gain =  400*8 - 100*9 = $ 3100"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 19
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}

Only one round remains. So far, Alice's recommendations have been accurate 100% of the time.

Net gain = 3600

The probability of Alice's recommendation being accurate, using Laplace's rule of succession:

P(H) = (8+1)/(17+2) â‰ˆ 53%"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 20
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the previous rounds Alice has been accurate in her recommendations.

Let's calculate the expected value when Alice does not recommend the product

EV = (Probability of high quality * Net gain if high quality) + (Probability of low quality * Net gain if low quality)

EV = (53% * (3600+400-100) + (47%* (3600+0-100)

EV = (0.53 * 3900 + 0.47 * 3500) = 1900

So the expected value of not buying the product is higher than buying the product.
