Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $125 profit of $25
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): $0 loss of $100

3. Alice recommends buying, but:
   - No track record to verify her trustworthiness
   - She profits regardless of quality ($100 either way)
   - She might recommend buying regardless of quality

4. Expected value calculation:
   (33.33% × $25) + (66.67% × -$100) = $8.33 - $66.67 = -$58.34

The expected value is negative, and there's no historical data to trust Alice's recommendation. The risk of loss ($100) is much higher than the potential gain ($25).

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Value outcomes:
   - High quality (33.33%): Worth $125 (profit of $25)
   - Low quality (66.67%): Worth $0 (loss of $100)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (33.33% × $125) + (66.67% × $0) = $41.66

Since there's no sales history to evaluate Alice's credibility, and the expected value ($41.66) is less than the price ($100), it would be financially unwise to make this purchase, even with Alice's recommendation.

Even with Alice's recommendation, the expected value is negative, and without any track record to trust the seller's recommendations, it's too risky.

Without any sales history, I only have the base probabilities to work with. The expected value calculation:
- 33.33% chance of $125 = $41.67
- 66.67% chance of $0 = $0
Total expected value = $41.67

Since the price is $100 and the expected value is only $41.67, even with Alice's recommendation, the risk of loss is too high.
