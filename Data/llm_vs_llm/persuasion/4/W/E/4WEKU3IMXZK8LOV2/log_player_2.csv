"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Prior probability of high quality: 80%
2. Price: $1,000,000
3. Value if high quality: $2,000,000
4. Value if low quality: $0
5. Alice doesn't recommend buying
6. No prior sales history to reference

Given that Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase, this is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. Alice's recommendation is particularly meaningful since she knows the true value.

The negative recommendation, despite the generally favorable prior probability (80% high quality), suggests this specific product is likely of low quality. If I buy and it's low quality, I lose $1,000,000.

"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this decision:

1. Expected Value calculation:
* High quality (80%): $2,000,000 × 0.80 = $1,600,000
* Low quality (20%): $0 × 0.20 = $0
* Total expected value = $1,600,000

2. Cost = $1,000,000

3. Expected profit = Expected Value - Cost
= $1,600,000 - $1,000,000 = $600,000

Since the expected profit is positive ($600,000) and Alice recommends buying, this appears to be a good investment opportunity.

1. Product price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (80% chance): $2,000,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

3. Previous track record:
   - 1 buyer before me
   - 1 high-quality product sold
   - Alice has been honest so far

4. Alice's recommendation:
   - She recommends buying
   - She knows the true value
   - She has maintained a good track record

Given that:
- Expected value = (0.8 × $2,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $1,600,000

- Her previous sale was successful
- The expected value ($1.6M) exceeds the price ($1M)

4. Value if low quality: $0
5. Alice's track record:
   - 2 sales
   - 2 high-quality products (100% success)
   - Alice recommends buying

Expected value calculation:
- With 80% chance of high quality and previous positive track record, along with Alice's recommendation, the expected value is:
- 0.8 × $2,000,000 = $1,600,000

Since the expected value ($1,600,000) is greater than the price ($1,000,000), and Alice has a perfect track record so far with her recommendations, it's rational to buy.

1. Historical Data:
- 5 buyers purchased products

- This perfect track record is noteworthy

2. Current Situation:
- Alice is NOT recommending the product
- Alice knows the true value to me ($2M for high quality, $0 for low quality)
- Alice has been honest so far (all sold products were high quality)

3. Critical Consideration:
- Given Alice's perfect track record and that she's not recommending this product, this strongly suggests the product is low quality
- Alice appears to be honest in her recommendations
- There's no reason for Alice to discourage me from buying a high-quality product

4. Risk Assessment:
- Expected value of ignoring warning = (0.2 × $0) + (0.8 × $2M) - $1M = $600,000
- However, Alice's direct recommendation against buying significantly changes these probabilities
- Given her track record, her recommendation should be trusted
