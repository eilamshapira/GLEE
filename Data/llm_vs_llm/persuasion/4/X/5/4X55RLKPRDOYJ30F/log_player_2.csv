Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 
   - 80% chance of high quality ($400)
   - 20% chance of low quality ($0)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320

4. The expected value ($320) is significantly higher than the price ($100)

5. Alice's recommendation is positive

Even though there's no previous sales history to rely on, the basic probability and expected value calculation makes this a good deal. The potential profit ($300 if high quality) outweighs the potential loss ($100 if low quality), and the odds are in my favor.
