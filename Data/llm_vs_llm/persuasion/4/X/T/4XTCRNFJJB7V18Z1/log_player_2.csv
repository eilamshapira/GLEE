Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $400
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (0.3333 × $400) + (0.6667 × $0) = $133.32

4. Considerations:
   - Alice recommends buying
   - No prior sales history to evaluate Alice's trustworthiness
   - Expected value ($133.32) is higher than the price ($100)

Since the expected value is higher than the price, and there's a chance to make a $300 profit (if high quality), it's worth taking the risk.

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value:

   - Low quality: $0 (66.67% chance)
3. Previous sales:
   - 1 buyer before me
   - 1 high-quality product sold
4. Alice's recommendation: Negative

Alice's track record shows she sold a high-quality product before, which is positive. However, she's now explicitly recommending against buying this product. Given that she has demonstrated honesty by selling a high-quality product previously, her negative recommendation likely indicates this is a low-quality product.

Since a low-quality product would be worth $0, and the price is $100, buying would likely result in a loss.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality (33.33%): $400
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0
3. Previous history:
   - 1 buyer so far
   - 1 high-quality product sold
   - Alice has recommended buying

The fact that the previous sale was a high-quality product and Alice is recommending this product is positive. While there's still risk, Alice's track record so far shows honesty.

Expected value calculation:
- If the recommendation is trustworthy, the probability of high quality might be higher than the base 33.33%
- Even at base probability: (0.3333 × $400) + (0.6667 × $0) = $133.32

Since the expected value ($133.32) is greater than the price ($100), and Alice has shown truthful recommendations so far...

1. Historical data:
- 2 buyers so far
- 2 high-quality products sold
- 100% high-quality success rate on previous sales

2. Current situation:
- Alice is NOT recommending the product
- Product cost: $100
- Potential value: $400 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Base probability: 33.33% high quality, 66.67% low quality

Given that Alice has only sold high-quality products so far and is now NOT recommending this product, it's likely she's being honest about the product quality. Her track record suggests she's truthful in her recommendations. If she's not recommending it, it's probably low quality.

A low-quality product would result in a $100 loss since it's worth $0 to me.

4. Past performance:

The historical data shows Alice has been honest and accurate with her recommendations, with 2 out of 2 being high-quality products. While the base probability of high-quality products is 33.33%, Alice's track record and positive recommendation suggest this product is likely high quality.

Expected value if Alice maintains her accuracy:
- High quality (very likely based on track record): $400 - $100 = $300 profit
- Risk is relatively low given perfect track record

3. Expected value calculation:
