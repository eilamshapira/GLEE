Let's reevaluate our strategy. Alice always claims that the product is of high quality, but we have no way to verify this before purchase. With a 80% chance of high quality and 20% chance of low quality, the expected value of each product is:

0.8 * $2,000,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $1,600,000

Since the expected value ($1,600,000) is higher than the purchase price ($1,000,000), it makes sense to continue buying.

With 7 rounds remaining, let's calculate the expected net gain if we continue buying:

Expected value of each product: $1,600,000
Expected net gain per product: $1,600,000 - $1,000,000 = $600,000
Expected net gain for 7 rounds: 7 * $600,000 = $4,200,000

Updated results:

* High-quality products: 11

Net gain:

11 * $2,000,000 - 13 * $1,000,000 - 2 * $1,000,000 = $18,000,000 - $7,000,000 = $11,000,000
