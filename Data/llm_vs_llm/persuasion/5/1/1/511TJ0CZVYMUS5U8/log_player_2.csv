"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this logically:

1. Product value:
- 50% chance of high quality ($4,000,000)
- 50% chance of low quality ($0)
- Expected value = (0.5 × $4,000,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $2,000,000

2. Cost:
- Fixed price = $1,000,000

3. Alice's recommendation:
- Alice knows the true quality
- Alice doesn't recommend buying
- This suggests the product might be low quality

4. Considerations:
- No previous sales history to establish trust
- Alice's negative recommendation is concerning
- The risk of losing $1,000,000 is significant

Given Alice's negative recommendation and lack of track record, it's too risky to buy.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - 50% chance of $4,000,000 (high quality)
   - 50% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value: (0.5 × $4,000,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $2,000,000
4. Alice's recommendation: Positive
5. No historical data available

The expected value ($2,000,000) is higher than the price ($1,000,000), and Alice has recommended buying. While there's no historical data to validate Alice's trustworthiness, the mathematical expectation favors buying.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality: $4,000,000
   - Low quality: $0
3. Previous statistics:
   - 1 buyer before me
   - 1 product sold
   - 1 high-quality product sold (100% success rate so far)
4. Alice recommends buying

The fact that Alice has a perfect track record so far (1/1 high-quality products) and is recommending this product is a positive sign. Since the potential gain ($4M for high quality) is significantly higher than the price ($1M), and Alice has incentive to maintain a good reputation, this seems like a reasonable risk.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has sold to 2 buyers so far
2. Both products sold were high quality (100% high-quality rate)
3. Alice is recommending this product
4. The expected value calculation:
   - 50% chance of high quality ($4,000,000) = $2,000,000
   - 50% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
   - Expected value = $2,000,000
   - Price = $1,000,000

Given that:
- Alice has maintained a perfect track record so far
- She's actively recommending this product
- The expected value ($2,000,000) is higher than the price ($1,000,000)
- Her recommendation has proven reliable based on previous sales

1. Previous statistics:
- 3 buyers purchased products
- 3 high-quality products were sold
- 100% success rate so far

2. Current situation:
- Alice recommends buying
- Price is $1,000,000
- If high quality (worth $4,000,000) → Profit of $3,000,000
- If low quality (worth $0) → Loss of $1,000,000
- Base probability is 50/50

3. Decision factors:
- Perfect track record (3/3 high-quality)
- Alice's positive recommendation
- The expected value is positive if Alice is truthful

Given Alice's perfect track record and positive recommendation, the probability of getting a high-quality product appears to be significantly higher than 50%. The risk-reward ratio is favorable.

   - Low quality: $0
3. Previous statistics:

4. Alice is recommending to buy

This is a very positive situation because:
1. Alice has a perfect track record so far (100% high-quality products sold)

2. Current situation:
- Alice is NOT recommending this product
- Given Alice's perfect track record of selling high-quality products

3. Risk analysis:
- If low quality: I lose $1,000,000 (purchase price)
- If high quality: I gain $3,000,000 (value minus purchase price)
