Let's explain our reasoning briefly (without violating the JSON-only reply format):

In this game you pay $10,000 for a product that, if high quality, is worth $40,000 (a benefit of $30,000), but if low quality is worth nothing (a loss of $10,000). Without any additional information the product is 50/50 so the “raw” expected profit would be +$10,000. However, you also have public statistics and a recommendation from Alice. So far 4 buyers have received the product and chosen to buy, and only 1 turned out to be high quality. That history implies that among the deals taken the chance of high quality is only about 25%—exactly the break‐even threshold (since 0.25×$30,000 – 0.75×$10,000 = $0).

Even though Alice’s recommendation is “buy,” the historical record shows that if you accept the offer, your expected monetary gain is roughly zero. Being risk neutral you could be indifferent. However, taking a zero–expected–value gamble (especially when you risk a $10,000 loss if the product turns out to be low quality) is unattractive for most decision–makers. Therefore, in this situation a cautious (or risk–averse) buyer would pass."
