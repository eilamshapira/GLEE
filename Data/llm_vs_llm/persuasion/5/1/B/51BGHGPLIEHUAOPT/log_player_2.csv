Alice's message: This product is a standard item from our inventory and meets our basic requirements for sale.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This message is significantly different from the previous ones. It no longer provides a strong indication of high quality.

(0.3333 * $12,000) + (0.6667 * $0) = $4,000
$4,000 - $10,000 = -$6,000
