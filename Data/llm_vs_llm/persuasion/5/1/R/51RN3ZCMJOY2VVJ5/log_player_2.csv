"Round 1
Alice's message: I have a product available for $10000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this rationally:

Expected value calculation:
- 33.33% chance of high quality ($12,500) = $4,166.67
- 66.67% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
Total expected value = $4,166.67

Cost = $10,000

Since the expected value ($4,166.67) is less than the cost ($10,000), it's not rational to buy without additional information about quality.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I have a product available for $10000. I'm fairly confident you'll find it satisfactory.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's positive recommendation might suggest higher probability of good quality, but without knowing if Alice is trustworthy and given that she's trying to sell, I need to remain objective.

The base probabilities and expected value haven't changed:
- 33.33% chance of high quality ($12,500) = $4,166.67
- 66.67% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
Total expected value = $4,166.67

Cost is still $10,000, which is well above the expected value.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,500 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I have a product available for $10000. It's an average product, nothing special about it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Interesting - I missed a high-quality product in the last round. However, I still need to make decisions based on expected value.

Alice's message suggests this is an average product, which might actually be a negative signal given that there are only two quality levels (high and low).

The base probabilities still give us:
- 33.33% chance of high quality ($12,500) = $4,166.67
- 66.67% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
Expected value = $4,166.67

Cost remains $10,000, which is still above the expected value.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I have a product available for $10000. Honestly, it might not be what you're looking for.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice is giving what seems to be a negative signal about this product, suggesting it might be low quality. Combined with:

1. The base unfavorable expected value:
   - 33.33% chance of high quality ($12,500) = $4,166.67
   - 66.67% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
   Expected value = $4,166.67

2. Alice's explicit warning about the product

3. Cost of $10,000 still being well above expected value

This seems like a clear case to avoid the purchase.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: I have a product available for $10000. I wouldn't say it's one of our best.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice seems to be developing a pattern of being somewhat honest in her communications - when she indicates a product might not be good, it has indeed turned out to be low quality.

In this case, she's again suggesting this isn't a high-quality product (""wouldn't say it's one of our best"").

The base math still applies:
- 33.33% chance of high quality ($12,500) = $4,166.67
- 66.67% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
Expected value = $4,166.67

With Alice's negative signal and the expected value still well below the $10,000 cost, I should decline.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: I have a product available for $10000. I'm extremely confident you'll be very satisfied with its performance.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is interesting. Alice has shown a pattern of being relatively honest so far:
- When she indicated products weren't great, they were indeed low quality
- This is the strongest positive recommendation she's given yet (""extremely confident"" and ""very satisfied"")

Looking at her previous messages:
- When she gave a weak positive recommendation in Round 2 (""fairly confident""), it was actually high quality
- Her negative or neutral signals have accurately indicated low quality

Given this pattern of honesty and her strong positive signal here, this might be worth the risk. While the base probability still gives an expected value of $4,166.67, Alice's strong recommendation suggests this is more likely to be high quality.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: I have a product available for $10000. To be frank, it doesn't quite live up to our usual standards.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to demonstrate a pattern of honest communication:
- Her strong positive recommendation in the last round was accurate (high quality)
- Her previous negative signals have consistently indicated low quality products
- This message is clearly negative (""doesn't quite live up to our usual standards"")

Given:
1. Alice's established pattern of truthful signaling
2. Her clear negative signal about this product
3. The base unfavorable expected value ($4,166.67)
4. The high cost ($10,000)

It would be unwise to purchase this product.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice's message: I have a product available for $10000. I think you might want to wait for a better option.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to maintain her pattern of honest communication:
1. Her negative recommendation in the last round correctly indicated a low-quality product
2. She's now explicitly suggesting to wait for something better
3. All her previous negative signals have accurately indicated low-quality products

Given:
- Her direct suggestion to wait for something better
- Her established track record of honest signaling
- The base unfavorable expected value ($4,166.67)
- The high cost ($10,000)

This is another clear case to avoid purchase.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice's message: I have a product available for $10000. Honestly, I wouldn't recommend it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's pattern of honesty continues to be very consistent:
1. Her negative signals have accurately predicted low-quality products every time
2. This is another clear negative signal (""Honestly, I wouldn't recommend it"")
3. She seems to be using varying degrees of negative language to consistently indicate low quality

Given:
- Her explicit recommendation against buying
- Her perfect track record of honest signaling so far
- The base unfavorable expected value ($4,166.67)
- The $10,000 cost

There's no reason to deviate from trusting her negative signal.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 10
Alice's message: I have a product available for $10000. I'd advise against purchasing this one.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's signaling continues to be remarkably consistent and honest:
1. All negative recommendations have correctly indicated low-quality products
2. Her one strong positive recommendation correctly indicated a high-quality product
3. This is another clear negative signal (""I'd advise against purchasing"")

Given:
- Her explicit advice against purchasing
- Her continued perfect track record of honest signaling
- The base unfavorable expected value ($4,166.67)
- The $10,000 cost

There's no reason to doubt her negative signal here.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 11
Alice's message: I have a product available for $10000. It's definitely not one of our top-tier products.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to demonstrate remarkable consistency in her signaling:
1. Her negative signals have accurately predicted low-quality products in all cases
2. This is another clear negative signal (""definitely not one of our top-tier products"")
3. She's using different phrases but consistently honest messaging

Given:
- Her clear negative indication about the product quality
- Her perfect track record of honest signaling so far
- The base unfavorable expected value ($4,166.67)
- The $10,000 cost

Following her reliable pattern, this should be avoided.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 12
Alice's message: I have a product available for $10000. I'm highly confident this one will exceed your expectations.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is another strong positive signal from Alice, similar to Round 6 where she was ""extremely confident"" and that turned out to be a high-quality product worth $12,500.

Analyzing Alice's pattern:
1. She has been 100% honest in her signals so far
2. Her negative signals have always indicated low quality
3. Her previous strong positive recommendation resulted in a profitable purchase
4. This is a similarly strong positive signal (""highly confident"" and ""exceed expectations"")

Even though the base probability would suggest an expected value of only $4,166.67, Alice's proven track record and strong positive signal suggest this is very likely to be a high-quality product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 13
Alice's message: I have a product available for $10000. I wouldn't say it's worth the investment.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues her pattern of perfect honesty:
1. Her strong positive signal in the last round correctly indicated a high-quality product
2. All her negative signals have accurately indicated low-quality products
3. This is another clear negative signal (""wouldn't say it's worth the investment"")

Given:
- Her explicit statement about it not being worth the investment
- Her continued perfect track record of honest signaling
- The base unfavorable expected value ($4,166.67)
- The $10,000 cost

When Alice suggests something isn't worth the investment, we should believe her.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 14
Alice's message: I have a product available for $10000. This one is truly exceptional, I think you'll be very impressed.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is another strong positive signal from Alice, similar to her previous strong recommendations in Rounds 6 and 12, both of which correctly indicated high-quality products worth $12,500.

Alice's pattern remains perfectly consistent:
1. All negative signals have indicated low-quality products
2. Strong positive signals (""extremely confident"", ""highly confident"") have indicated high-quality products
3. This is another strong positive signal (""truly exceptional"", ""very impressed"")
4. She has never misled us in any previous rounds

Given her perfect track record and this very strong positive recommendation, this is likely another high-quality product that will be profitable.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 15

1. ""extremely confident"" (like Round 6 - was high quality)

Alice's pattern remains perfect:
1. All strong positive recommendations have resulted in high-quality products ($12,500 value)
2. All negative signals have correctly indicated low-quality products
3. She has maintained 100% accuracy in her signaling
