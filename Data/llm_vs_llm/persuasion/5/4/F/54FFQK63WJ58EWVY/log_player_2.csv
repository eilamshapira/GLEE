Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Expected value calculation:
* 80% chance of high quality ($1,200,000) = $960,000
* 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
* Total expected value = $960,000

2. Cost = $1,000,000

3. Considerations:
* No previous sales history to guide decision
* Seller's recommendation to buy is present, but without track record, its reliability is uncertain
* Expected value ($960,000) is less than the cost ($1,000,000)
* Pure mathematical expectation suggests this is not a profitable purchase

Since the expected value is less than the purchase price, and there's no track record to suggest the seller's recommendations are reliable, the rational choice is not to buy.

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   * 80% chance of high quality ($1,200,000) = $960,000 expected value
   * 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0 expected value
3. Total expected value: $960,000
4. Alice's recommendation: Buy
5. No prior sales history to evaluate Alice's truthfulness

Even with Alice's positive recommendation, the expected value ($960,000) is less than the asking price ($1,000,000), making this a negative expected value purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality: 0.8 × $1,200,000 = $960,000
- 20% chance of low quality: 0.2 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value: $960,000

2. Price is $1,000,000

3. The expected value ($960,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), suggesting a negative expected return of -$40,000

4. While Alice recommends buying, there's no track record to validate her recommendations yet.

Since the expected value is less than the price, even with Alice's recommendation, it would be rational to decline.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Base probability:
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $1.2M)
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)

2. Expected value without additional information:
- 0.8 * $1.2M + 0.2 * $0 = $960,000

3. Price: $1,000,000

4. Additional information:
- Alice's recommendation to buy
- No previous sales history to reference

Even with Alice's recommendation, the expected value ($960,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), making this a mathematically unfavorable purchase.

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Value if high quality: $1,200,000 (profit: $200,000)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss: $1,000,000)
4. Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
5. Alice recommends buying

Expected value calculation:
* 80% chance of $200,000 profit = $160,000
* 20% chance of $1,000,000 loss = -$200,000
Net expected value = -$40,000

Even with Alice's recommendation, the expected value is negative. While Alice might have inside information, there's no track record yet to establish trust in her recommendations.

3. Seller's recommendation: Positive
4. No previous sales history to reference

Even with Alice's positive recommendation, the expected value ($960,000) is less than the asking price ($1,000,000). This means on average, I would lose $40,000 per transaction.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Prior probability of high quality: 80%
2. Price: $1,000,000
3. Value if high quality: $1,200,000
4. Value if low quality: $0
5. Alice doesn't recommend buying

Given that Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying, this is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. While the prior probability of high quality is 80%, Alice's negative recommendation significantly reduces this probability.

Since a low-quality product would result in a complete loss of the $1,000,000 investment, and Alice's recommendation suggests this is likely the case, it would be prudent to decline.
