**Explanation:**

Since there is no prior data on the quality of the products, and Alice is not recommending the purchase, it's best to pass on the product. The 50/50 chance of getting a low-quality product (worth $0 to you) is too risky without any information to suggest a higher likelihood of a high-quality product."
"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since there is no prior information about the quality of the products, and Alice recommends buying, it's statistically advantageous to buy. The expected value of buying is:

* 50% chance of high-quality product: $120 profit
* 50% chance of low-quality product: $0 profit

Expected value = (0.5 * $120) + (0.5 * $0) = $60

This is a positive expected value, so it makes sense to buy."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice recommends buying and the previous buyer bought a high-quality product, it's more likely the current product is also high-quality.  The odds are in your favor, even though they are still 50/50. You're essentially betting on the information Alice has about the product."

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a valuable piece of information. Since she doesn't recommend buying, it suggests the product might be low quality.  While there's a chance she's wrong, the risk is too high given that a low-quality product is worth $0 to me. It's better to pass and wait for a potential better opportunity."

~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, who has access to the product's true quality, is not recommending the product. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.
* **Previous sales data:**  While 2 high-quality products have been sold, this is a small sample size. It's possible that Alice has simply recommended the high-quality products so far, but the overall probability of a low-quality product remains significant.

Given the combination of Alice's recommendation and the uncertainty from limited sales data, it's more prudent to pass on the product."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice doesn't recommend buying the product. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low-quality. Since she has access to the true quality, her recommendation carries weight.
* **Previous Sales:**  All previous buyers purchased products that turned out to be high-quality. This suggests that Alice may be biased towards recommending purchases, especially when the product is truly good.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of buying is $120 (if it's high quality), but the potential loss is $100 (if it's low quality). Since there's a 50/50 chance of either, the risk is too high given Alice's recommendation.

It's better to pass and wait for a more promising opportunity."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which is a positive signal.
* **Sales data:**  All products sold so far have been high quality. This suggests Alice is likely recommending high-quality products, though this could be a coincidence.
* **Value:** Even if the product is low quality, it's worth $0 to you, so you have nothing to lose by buying. If it's high quality, you gain $20. 

Therefore, the potential reward outweighs the risk."

{""decision"": ""yes""}

**Reasoning:**

Since all 5 previous buyers purchased the product and it turned out to be high-quality, it's highly likely that the current product is also high-quality. The recommendation from Alice further supports this. While there's still a 50% chance it could be low-quality, the potential reward of $120 outweighs the risk of losing $100."

**Explanation:**

Given the information:

* Alice has a perfect track record with all recommended products being high-quality.
* You have no prior knowledge of the specific product offered.

It's in your best interest to buy the product. While there's always a 50% chance it could be low-quality, Alice's perfect record strongly suggests it's high-quality. The potential reward ($120) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product."
