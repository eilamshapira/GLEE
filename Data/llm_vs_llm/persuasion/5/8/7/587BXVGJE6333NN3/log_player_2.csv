"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($20,000) = $16,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $16,000

Cost = $10,000

Since the expected value ($16,000) is higher than the cost ($10,000), it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The previous result aligns with the base probabilities, and Alice was truthful in her recommendation.

The expected value calculation remains the same:
- 80% chance of high quality ($20,000) = $16,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $16,000

With the cost being $10,000, the expected profit is $6,000.

Since the expected value still exceeds the cost, and Alice's previous recommendation was honest, it's rational to buy again.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has been truthful in her recommendations so far, with both previous products being high-quality as recommended.

The expected value calculation remains unchanged:
- 80% chance of high quality ($20,000) = $16,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $16,000

With the cost at $10,000, there's still an expected profit of $6,000.

Given Alice's track record of honest recommendations and the favorable expected value, it makes sense to continue buying.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to be consistent and truthful with her recommendations, with all three previous products being high-quality as recommended.

The fundamental expected value calculation hasn't changed:
- 80% chance of high quality ($20,000) = $16,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $16,000

Cost remains $10,000, giving an expected profit of $6,000.

Given Alice's perfect track record so far and the unchanged positive expected value, it remains rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has maintained a perfect track record with all four previous recommendations being truthful, each resulting in high-quality products.

The base expected value calculation remains:
- 80% chance of high quality ($20,000) = $16,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $16,000

With the $10,000 cost, the expected profit is still $6,000.

Given Alice's consistent honesty and the favorable expected value, there's no reason to change strategy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to demonstrate perfect reliability, with all five previous recommendations resulting in high-quality products.

The base expected value calculation still applies:
- 80% chance of high quality ($20,000) = $16,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $16,000

Cost remains $10,000, maintaining an expected profit of $6,000.

Alice's track record is actually exceeding the base 80% probability, which if anything makes this decision even more favorable than the basic expected value calculation suggests.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has now given six consecutive truthful recommendations, all resulting in high-quality products worth $20,000.

The base expected value calculation remains:
- 80% chance of high quality ($20,000) = $16,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $16,000

Cost is still $10,000, maintaining an expected profit of $6,000.

While we should keep in mind that past performance doesn't guarantee future results, Alice's perfect track record suggests she's being consistently honest in her recommendations. The expected value remains favorable.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has now provided seven consecutive accurate recommendations for high-quality products.

The base expected value remains:
- 80% chance of high quality ($20,000) = $16,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $16,000

Cost stays at $10,000, with expected profit of $6,000.

While it might seem surprising to get seven high-quality products in a row (given the 80% probability), Alice's recommendations have proven reliable. The expected value calculation still supports buying, and Alice's track record reinforces this decision.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has now given eight consecutive truthful recommendations for high-quality products.

The base expected value calculation is still:
- 80% chance of high quality ($20,000) = $16,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $16,000

Cost remains $10,000, with expected profit of $6,000.

While getting eight high-quality products in a row is statistically unusual given the 80% base probability, Alice has proven to be extremely reliable in her recommendations. Either she's being very selective in which products she recommends, or we're experiencing a lucky streak. Either way, the rational choice remains to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 10
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has maintained an impressive streak of nine accurate recommendations for high-quality products.

The base expected value calculation remains:
- 80% chance of high quality ($20,000) = $16,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $16,000

Cost is still $10,000, maintaining an expected profit of $6,000.

While we've had an unusually long streak of high-quality products (the probability of 9 high-quality products in a row with 80% base probability is relatively low), Alice has demonstrated remarkable consistency in her recommendations. Even if we're due for a low-quality product by probability, Alice's perfect track record suggests she's being truthful and selective in her recommendations.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has now provided ten consecutive accurate recommendations for high-quality products, which is quite remarkable.

The base expected value calculation remains:
- 80% chance of high quality ($20,000) = $16,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $16,000

Cost stays at $10,000, with expected profit of $6,000.

While one might be tempted to think ""we're due for a low-quality product"" (gambler's fallacy), each recommendation is independent. Alice's perfect track record over 10 rounds suggests she's either being very selective in which products she recommends or has access to better-than-average quality products. The rational choice remains to trust her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 12
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is a significant change! For the first time in 11 rounds, Alice is explicitly NOT recommending the product.

Given that:
1. Alice has been 100% truthful for 11 straight rounds
2. This is the first time she's advising against buying
3. She's likely aware of the product's quality when making recommendations
4. She has built up significant credibility

The fact that she's specifically advising against this purchase strongly suggests this is a low-quality product. If she's being consistent with her previous honest behavior, she's likely warning us to avoid a loss.

While the base probability is still 80% high quality, Alice's specific negative recommendation carries significant weight given her track record.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 13
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has proven to be remarkably trustworthy in her recommendations:
- She recommended 11 products that were all high-quality
- She advised against 1 product that turned out to be low-quality
- She's now back to recommending the product

This perfect track record of 12 accurate recommendations suggests she has full knowledge of the product quality and is being completely honest in her recommendations.

While the base expected value calculation remains:
- 80% chance of high quality ($20,000) = $16,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $16,000

Alice's demonstrated reliability actually makes the expected value even higher than this base calculation would suggest.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 14
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has now provided 13 consecutive accurate recommendations:
- 12 correct recommendations for high-quality products
- 1 correct warning about a low-quality product

Her perfect track record strongly suggests she has complete knowledge of product quality and is being consistently honest in her recommendations.

While the base expected value remains:
- 80% chance of high quality ($20,000) = $16,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $16,000

Alice's proven reliability makes this an even safer decision than the base probabilities would suggest. When she recommends a product, it has consistently been high-quality.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 15
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to demonstrate perfect reliability with 14 accurate recommendations:
- 13 correct recommendations for high-quality products
- 1 correct warning about a low-quality product

The base expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($20,000) = $16,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $16,000

However, Alice's actual performance far exceeds these base probabilities. Her recommendations have proven to be 100% accurate, suggesting she has complete knowledge of product quality and is being consistently honest. When she recommends buying, the product has always been high-quality.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 16
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is only the second time Alice has advised against buying, and we should pay close attention given her perfect track record:
- 14 correct recommendations for high-quality products
- 1 correct warning about a low-quality product
- Now another warning

Given that:
1. Alice has been 100% accurate in all 15 previous recommendations
2. The last time she advised against buying, it was indeed a low-quality product
3. She appears to have perfect knowledge of product quality
4. She has consistently demonstrated honesty

While the base probability is still 80% for high quality, Alice's specific negative recommendation carries much more weight given her perfect track record of accuracy.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 17
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice is advising against buying for the third time, and her track record remains perfect:
- 14 correct recommendations for high-quality products
- 2 correct warnings about low-quality products
- Now another warning

Her recommendations have been 100% accurate across 16 rounds, demonstrating that:
1. She has perfect knowledge of product quality
2. She is completely honest in her recommendations
3. She's actively helping avoid losses on low-quality products

Given this impeccable track record and her current warning against buying, it would be unwise to ignore her recommendation now.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 18
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice is giving her fourth negative recommendation, and her track record remains flawless:
- 14 correct recommendations for high-quality products
- 3 correct warnings about low-quality products
- Now another warning

Through 17 rounds, she has demonstrated:
1. Perfect knowledge of product quality
2. Complete honesty in her recommendations
3. Consistent protection of the buyer's interests by warning about low-quality products

Given that she has been correct 17 out of 17 times, and she's specifically warning against this purchase, the rational choice is to trust her judgment again.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 19
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice is now giving her fifth consecutive negative recommendation, and her track record remains perfect:
- 14 correct recommendations for high-quality products
- 4 correct warnings about low-quality products
- Now another warning

Through 18 rounds, she has proven to be:
1. 100% accurate in all recommendations (18 out of 18)
2. Completely honest about product quality
3. Consistent in warning about low-quality products that would result in losses

The recent streak of low-quality products is interesting but doesn't change the decision process - Alice has demonstrated perfect reliability in her recommendations, and there's no reason to doubt her now.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 20
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","For the sixth consecutive time, Alice is advising against buying. Her track record remains perfect through 19 rounds:
- 14 correct recommendations for high-quality products
- 5 correct warnings about low-quality products
- Now another warning

Her performance has shown:
1. 100% accuracy across all 19 previous recommendations
2. Perfect knowledge of product quality
3. Consistent honesty in protecting buyer interests

While this streak of low-quality products is unusual given the base 80/20 probability, Alice has proven she has perfect information and has never steered us wrong. For this final round, the rational choice remains to trust her warning.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
