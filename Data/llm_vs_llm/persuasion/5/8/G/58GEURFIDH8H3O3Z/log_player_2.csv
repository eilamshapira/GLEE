"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this decision:

- Product price: $10,000
- High quality value: $12,500 (profit of $2,500)
- Low quality value: $0 (loss of $10,000)
- Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality

Alice doesn't recommend buying this product. Since Alice knows the true quality, this is likely a signal that the product is low quality. If I buy a low-quality product, I'll lose $10,000.

Even without Alice's recommendation, the expected value calculation would be:
0.8 × $12,500 + 0.2 × $0 - $10,000 = $10,000 - $10,000 = $0

With Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of this being low quality is likely much higher than 20%, making the expected value negative.
