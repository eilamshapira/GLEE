Let's explain briefly without giving too many game‐theory details:

Alice charges a fixed $100. A good product is worth $200 and a bad one $0, so if you end up with a good product you “profit” $100, but a bad one makes you lose $100. In a random product the chance of a good product is 33.33%, so the average expected profit is 0.3333×$100 + 0.6667×(–$100) ≈ –$33. Even though Alice “recommends” buying the product, the overall historical record—that out of the 3 sales only 1 was high‐quality—confirms that her recommendation doesn’t indicate a better-than‑random chance for a good product. In equilibrium a seller with no cost difference between selling good or bad products has the incentive to always recommend a purchase. Therefore, your optimal decision, given the negative expected value, is to pass."
