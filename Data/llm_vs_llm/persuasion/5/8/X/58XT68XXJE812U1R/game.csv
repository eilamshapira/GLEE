,,Alice,5,"Bob, I notice you've been hesitant to purchase so far. I want to be completely transparent with you: I understand this is a significant investment at $1000000, with the uncertainty of whether any product is high or low quality. However, today's product has exceptional testing results that I rarely see in our quality control process. It demonstrates all the characteristics of our highest performing units. I know I can't prove this to you before purchase, but I genuinely believe this particular product represents the positive side of the 50% probability you're weighing. If you're going to make a purchase at any point, products with indicators like this one presents would be the time to do so.

,,Alice,8,"Bob, I believe today represents a genuine opportunity. This product has just come through our quality assurance process with exceptional performance metrics across all testing parameters.

The precision engineering and performance indicators are truly impressive. While I can't prove the quality before purchase, I can tell you that based on our testing, this product exhibits the exact characteristics we see in products that deliver the full $2000000 value to customers. I understand your caution from previous rounds, but if you're waiting for a product with strong quality indicators, this one certainly qualifies.",

,,Alice,15,"Bob, I want to be direct: I understand you may have concluded that my product quality assessments cannot be trusted given the information asymmetry in our situation. That's a reasonable position. However, today I'm facing a professional dilemma - this product has demonstrated genuinely exceptional quality metrics during testing, placing it among the best I've seen. I've been honest about average products before, and I'm being equally honest now about this unit's outstanding characteristics. The challenge we face is fundamental: without a mechanism to credibly signal quality before purchase, you have no way to distinguish when I'm highlighting truly exceptional products versus making empty claims. I respect that limitation. Still, I want to state clearly that this particular product shows all the hallmarks of our highest-quality merchandise - the precise engineering, performance stability, and material quality that correlate with maximum value delivery.
