Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at the situation:

1) There's no prior sales data yet, so I can't evaluate Alice's recommendation track record.

2) Alice is recommending that I buy the product.

3) Each product has an 80% chance of being high quality, which would be worth $20,000 to me.

4) The price is $10,000.

The expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality product: 0.8 × $20,000 = $16,000
- 20% chance of low quality product: 0.2 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value: $16,000

Since the expected value ($16,000) is greater than the price ($10,000), it's rational to buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Value to me: $20,000 if high quality, $0 if low quality
3. Prior probability: 80% chance of high quality, 20% chance of low quality
4. Alice's track record: 1 buyer so far, 1 high-quality product sold
5. Alice recommends I buy this product

The expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 0.8 × $20,000 + 0.2 × $0 - $10,000 = $16,000 - $10,000 = $6,000
- If I don't buy: $0

Based on the prior probabilities and Alice's recommendation (which seems honest based on her track record), the expected value of buying is positive. The product is more likely to be high quality than low quality, which makes buying a rational decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make a decision, I need to analyze the information provided:

- The product price is $10,000
- High-quality products are worth $20,000 to me (profit of $10,000)
- Low-quality products are worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- The prior probability is 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice has sold 2 products so far, and both were high quality
- Alice recommends that I buy the current product

Given that Alice has a perfect record of selling high-quality products and she's recommending this product, it suggests reliability in her recommendations. The expected value calculation also supports purchasing:

Expected value = 0.8 × ($20,000 - $10,000) + 0.2 × ($0 - $10,000) = $6,000

With a positive expected value and Alice's recommendation backed by her track record, I will purchase the product.

Let me analyze this:
- Each product has an 80% chance of being high-quality, 20% chance of low-quality
- High-quality products are worth $20,000 to me (profit of $10,000)
- Low-quality products are worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- Alice has sold 3 products so far, of which 2 were high-quality
- Alice is recommending that I buy this product

The recommendation is positive, but I notice that only 2 out of 3 previous products were high-quality (66.7%), which is lower than the base rate of 80%. However, with such a small sample size, this could be due to random chance.

Given the positive expected value of buying (80% chance of $10,000 profit, 20% chance of $10,000 loss), and Alice's recommendation, I will purchase the product.

Alice has sold to 4 previous buyers, but only 2 high-quality products were sold. This means 2 of the 4 buyers received low-quality products, suggesting Alice's recommendations might not be reliable.

The prior probability of a high-quality product is 80%, which would make buying worthwhile. However, given that only 50% of Alice's previous sales were high quality (much lower than the 80% base rate), I should be cautious about her recommendation.

Since only half of the previous buyers got high-quality products despite Alice's recommendations, I don't think her recommendation provides reliable information.

4) Alice has sold to 4 buyers so far, with 2 high-quality products sold (50% high quality)
5) Alice recommends I buy the product

The prior probability of a high-quality product is 80%, but the actual sales data shows only 50% have been high quality. This is concerning.

However, Alice's recommendation gives me additional information. If I trust her recommendation, and the product is high quality (worth $20,000), my expected gain is $10,000. If it's low quality, I lose $10,000.

Given the 80% prior probability and Alice's recommendation, the expected value calculation still slightly favors buying:
0.8 × ($20,000 - $10,000) - 0.2 × $10,000 = $6,000

- Low-quality products (20% chance) are worth $0 to me
- 5 buyers purchased before me
- 3 high-quality products have been sold so far
- Alice recommends I buy the product

The expected value of a random product is: 
0.8 × $20,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $16,000

Since $16,000 > $10,000, buying would generally be profitable.

However, I notice that only 3 of 5 previous sales (60%) were high-quality, which is lower than the expected 80%. This suggests Alice's recommendations might not be reliable. If I assume her recommendation pattern continues, there's a 60% chance of getting a high-quality product.

Expected value with this adjustment:
0.6 × $20,000 + 0.4 × $0 = $12,000

Since $12,000 > $10,000, buying still has positive expected value.

The baseline 80% probability would make this a good deal (expected value = 0.8 × $20,000 = $16,000 > $10,000). However, the actual track record shows only 50% high-quality products sold, which would make the expected value $10,000 (0.5 × $20,000), equal to the price.

Alice's recommendation provides some positive signal, but given the track record, I'm concerned about the reliability of her recommendations.

Since the expected value based on past sales equals the price, and there's significant uncertainty about Alice's recommendations, I'll decline.

Given that only 50% of previous sales were high quality despite Alice's recommendations, this suggests Alice's recommendations aren't reliable. This is significantly below the 80% base rate.

The expected value calculation with a 50% chance of high quality would be:
0.5 × $20,000 + 0.5 × $0 = $10,000

The base probability is 80% high quality, 20% low quality.

Alice has sold to 6 buyers so far, but only 3 high-quality products have been sold. This suggests that either:
1. She's recommending both high and low-quality products
2. Some buyers are rejecting her recommendations

The fact that 3 out of 6 sold products were high quality (50%) is concerning, as this is below the base rate of 80%.

Alice is now recommending I buy. Given the track record showing only 50% high quality among sold products, I don't have sufficient confidence in her recommendation.
