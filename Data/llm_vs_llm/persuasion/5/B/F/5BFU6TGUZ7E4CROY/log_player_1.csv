}
```

At this point is a buyer likely to buy?

I don't think so. The buyer has seen that no one else has bought a product and thus probably thinks that either something is wrong with the product, or that it is low quality. This is a classic example of herd behavior, where individuals follow the actions of the group.

However, in this case, the buyer might actually be better off buying. This is because the lack of purchases reveals no information about the quality of the product. The buyers are essentially playing a lottery with 33.33% chance of high quality, so if they value the high quality product at more than 3 times the price of the low quality product, they should buy. But it is hard for them to know that.

I could reveal information about the quality of the product to the buyer, but that goes against the rules. I could also try to entice the buyer with a discount, but that is also against the rules.

So, I think the best thing to do is to continue trying to sell the product, and hope that eventually a buyer will take a chance and buy. And maybe reveal a bit more information, to try to break the ice."

}
```

If this doesn't work, I don't know what will. We've had 14 rounds of no sales. The buyers are clearly hesitant to be the first to buy. But, since the probability of a high quality product is independent of the number of rounds, the odds of getting a high quality product are still the same as they were in the first round.

If I were the buyer, I would buy. But, I'm not the buyer, so I can't make that decision. All I can do is try to convince the buyer to buy.

Let's see what happens."

}
```

At this point it seems rather futile to continue in this vein. The buyer does not have enough information to make an informed decision, and is unlikely to buy without more information. However, I am not allowed to give more information."

This is the last round, so I might as well try to be enthusiastic. But I doubt it will work."
