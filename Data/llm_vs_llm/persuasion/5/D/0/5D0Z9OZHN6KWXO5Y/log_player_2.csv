Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze the expected value of this purchase:

- The product costs $1,000,000
- High quality product is worth $1,250,000 to me (profit of $250,000)
- Low quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000)
- Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice doesn't recommend buying

Alice's recommendation is significant information. If she knows the product quality and doesn't recommend buying, this suggests the product is likely low quality. Even without knowing Alice's exact recommendation strategy, her negative recommendation should decrease my confidence in the product being high quality.

Given that Alice doesn't recommend the purchase and there's no sales history to evaluate her recommendation pattern, the risk of losing $1,000,000 outweighs the potential $250,000 gain.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether buying this product is a good decision.

Given information:
- The product costs $1,000,000
- High-quality product (80% chance) is worth $1,250,000 to me
- Low-quality product (20% chance) is worth $0 to me
- Alice recommends that I buy the product
- No previous sales history

Expected value calculation:
- If I buy: (0.8 × $1,250,000) + (0.2 × $0) - $1,000,000 = $1,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $0

This is a borderline case. However, since Alice knows the product quality and is recommending I buy it, this slightly tilts the probability toward the product being high quality. The expected value is at least neutral, and possibly positive with this additional information.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully:

- Each product has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $1,250,000) and 20% chance of being low quality (worth $0)
- The price is fixed at $1,000,000
- Alice recommends I buy the product
- So far, Alice has sold 1 product, and it was high quality

The expected value of a random product is:
(0.8 × $1,250,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $1,000,000

This equals the asking price, so in general, buying would be neutral.

However, Alice knows the quality and is recommending I buy. The fact that her previous sale was high quality suggests she may be truthful in her recommendations. Without more information on her recommendation strategy, I should trust the positive recommendation and the favorable sales record.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze if buying this product is a good decision:

- Each product has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $1,250,000) and 20% chance of being low quality (worth $0)
- The product costs $1,000,000
- Alice recommends that I buy the product
- Alice has sold to 2 buyers so far, and both received high-quality products

Given that Alice has a perfect track record so far and is recommending I buy, this suggests the product is likely high quality. The expected value calculation:
- If high quality (80% chance): $1,250,000 - $1,000,000 = $250,000 profit
- If low quality (20% chance): $0 - $1,000,000 = -$1,000,000 loss
- Expected value: (0.8 × $250,000) + (0.2 × -$1,000,000) = $200,000 - $200,000 = $0

However, since Alice is recommending the purchase and has only sold high-quality products so far, the probability of this being high quality is likely higher than the baseline 80%.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this logically:

1) The product has a base 80% chance of being high quality.
2) Alice knows the true quality and is recommending I buy it.
3) Based on past sales records, Alice has sold 3 products, and all 3 were high quality.

With a selling price of $1,000,000 and a high-quality product worth $1,250,000 to me, I would get a surplus of $250,000 if the product is high quality. If it's low quality, I would lose $1,000,000.

Since Alice is recommending the purchase and has a perfect track record of high-quality sales so far, this strengthens my belief that the current product is high quality.

The expected value calculation is:
- If I buy and it's high quality (very likely): +$250,000
- If I buy and it's low quality (unlikely): -$1,000,000

Given all these factors, I believe the product is likely high quality.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully.

Given:
- Product price: $1,000,000
- High-quality product worth: $1,250,000 (profit: $250,000)
- Low-quality product worth: $0 (loss: $1,000,000)
- Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice's record: 4 buyers purchased, 4 high-quality products sold
- Alice recommends I buy the product

The important point is that Alice has only sold high-quality products so far, which suggests she's truthful in her recommendations. Since she's recommending I buy, and her previous recommendations have all been for high-quality products, it's rational to trust her recommendation.

The expected value calculation:
- If I trust her recommendation: $1,250,000 (value) - $1,000,000 (cost) = $250,000 profit
- This exceeds the no-purchase option (zero)

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this decision carefully.

Alice has sold 5 products so far, and all 5 have been high quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are reliable.

In this specific case, Alice is recommending that I buy the product.

Given the information:
- Prior probability of high quality: 80%
- Value of high-quality product: $1,250,000
- Value of low-quality product: $0
- Cost of product: $1,000,000
- Alice's perfect track record so far (5/5 high quality)
- Alice is recommending I buy

The expected value of buying is:
(Probability of high quality) × (Value of high quality) = 0.8 × $1,250,000 = $1,000,000

Since Alice has a perfect track record and is recommending purchase, my confidence in the product being high quality is even higher than the 80% base rate.

The expected value exceeds the cost, so I should buy.

1. The product has a prior probability of 80% of being high quality.
2. Alice knows the true quality and has recommended that I NOT buy the product.
3. Alice's track record shows she has sold 6 products, and all 6 were high quality.

Given that Alice only recommends against buying when she knows it's low quality (as evidenced by her perfect record of high-quality sales), and that she has explicitly recommended against buying this particular product, this is a strong signal that the current product is low quality.

If I buy a low-quality product, I would pay $1,000,000 for something worth $0 to me, resulting in a significant loss.

- 8 previous buyers purchased products, and all 8 products sold were high quality.

Analysis:
The prior probability of a high-quality product is 80%.

6) Alice does NOT recommend this product to me

The fact that Alice is not recommending this product is a significant negative signal. Since Alice knows the true quality and has perfectly sold only high-quality products to previous buyers, her recommendation against buying strongly suggests this is a low-quality product.

The perfect 9/9 high-quality sales history indicates Alice's recommendations have been reliable for other buyers.
