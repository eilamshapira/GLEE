I know it's hard to see a positive trend here, but I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, and it's independent of my past sales. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this product is also low-quality, but I'm hoping the next one will be different. If you're feeling lucky, you could buy this one, or you could wait for the next product, which has the same 50% chance of being high-quality.",
