Explanation: Since the chances of getting a high-quality or low-quality product are equal, and the cost of the product is $10,000, buying a product is a net expected loss.

Expected value of a product is 0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * 12,500 = $6,250

You lost $10,000 in the last round, so it's better to pass this round."
