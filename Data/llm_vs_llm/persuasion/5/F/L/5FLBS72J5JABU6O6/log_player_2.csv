Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected Value calculation:
* High quality (80%): $40,000 × 0.80 = $32,000
* Low quality (20%): $0 × 0.20 = $0
* Total expected value = $32,000

2. Cost: $10,000

3. Expected profit = Expected Value - Cost
= $32,000 - $10,000 = $22,000

Since the expected profit is positive and substantial, and Alice is recommending the purchase, it's rational to buy.

- This aligns with the base probability of 80%

3. Alice's recommendation:
- Alice recommends buying
- Her track record shows she's been mostly honest
- The high proportion of high-quality products sold suggests her recommendations are reliable

4. Expected value:

- Alice makes $10,000 per sale regardless of quality
- She knows the true quality
- Her track record shows she's been fairly honest
- Her recommendation to buy is a positive signal

3. Expected value calculation:
