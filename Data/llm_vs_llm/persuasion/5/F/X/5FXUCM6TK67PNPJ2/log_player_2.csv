"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. Base case: Each product has 50% chance of being high/low quality
2. If high quality: I gain $30,000 - $10,000 = $20,000
3. If low quality: I lose $10,000
4. Expected value without any additional information:
   (50% × $20,000) + (50% × -$10,000) = $5,000

Even without fully knowing if Alice's recommendations are trustworthy yet, the base expected value is positive ($5,000), so it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given that:
1. Alice recommended buying in Round 1, and it was indeed high quality
2. This suggests Alice might be giving honest recommendations
3. She's recommending to buy again
4. The base expected value is still positive ($5,000)
5. Alice's previous honest recommendation increases my confidence

Since both the base expected value is positive and Alice has shown trustworthiness in her first recommendation, I should definitely buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Interesting development:
1. Alice's recommendations so far:
   - Round 1: Recommended buy → High quality (True)
   - Round 2: Recommended buy → Low quality (False)
2. This suggests Alice might be recommending ""buy"" regardless of quality
3. If she's always recommending buy, her recommendations provide no useful information
4. We're back to the base case with 50/50 odds
5. Base expected value is still positive: $5,000

Even though Alice's recommendations might not be reliable, the fundamental expected value of buying is still positive ($5,000). Therefore, I should still buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the pattern:
1. Alice's recommendations so far:
   - Round 1: Recommended buy → High quality (Profit $20,000)
   - Round 2: Recommended buy → Low quality (Loss $10,000)
   - Round 3: Recommended buy → High quality (Profit $20,000)
2. Net profit so far: $30,000
3. Alice seems to always recommend buying
4. Her recommendations don't provide additional information
5. Base expected value remains $5,000 per transaction

Despite Alice seemingly recommending ""buy"" for everything, the mathematical expectation remains positive. The random 50/50 chance still works in our favor with an expected profit of $5,000 per transaction.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!

1. Alice's recommendations so far:
   - Round 1: Buy → High quality (Profit $20,000)
   - Round 2: Buy → Low quality (Loss $10,000)
   - Round 3: Buy → High quality (Profit $20,000)
   - Round 4: Buy → Low quality (Loss $10,000)
2. Net profit: $20,000
3. Pattern confirms Alice recommends buying regardless of quality
4. We're seeing the expected 50/50 distribution of quality
5. Base expected value remains $5,000 per transaction

Although Alice's recommendations provide no information, the fundamental math still favors buying. Each transaction has a positive expected value of $5,000, regardless of Alice's recommendation.

   - Round 4: Buy → Low quality (-$10,000)
   - Round 5: Buy → Low quality (-$10,000)
2. Net profit: $10,000
3. Recent trend shows more low quality products
4. However, this is likely just random variance
5. The fundamental probability remains 50/50
6. Expected value is still $5,000 per transaction

Despite recent losses, the math hasn't changed. Each transaction independently has a positive expected value of $5,000. Past outcomes don't affect future probabilities in this case.

2. Recent pattern: 7 consecutive low-quality products

Even though we're seeing a concerning deviation from the expected 50/50 distribution, the rules of the game explicitly state that each product has a 50% chance of being high quality, independent of previous outcomes. 

The expected value calculation remains:
- 50% chance of +$20,000 (high quality)
- 50% chance of -$10,000 (low quality)
- Expected value = (0.5 × $20,000) + (0.5 × -$10,000) = $5,000

- Each transaction is independent
- Expected value remains $5,000 per transaction:
