Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully:

- The product costs $100
- High-quality probability is 80%, worth $400 to me
- Low-quality probability is 20%, worth $0 to me
- Expected value = (0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320
- Since $320 > $100, the expected value exceeds the cost

Alice has recommended buying the product, which aligns with the positive expected value calculation. While there's no sales history to reference, the base probability makes this a mathematically favorable decision.

"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

- Each product has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $400 to me) and a 20% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me)
- The product costs $100
- Alice recommends I buy the product
- Statistics show 1 buyer purchased so far, and 1 high-quality product has been sold

The expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 80% chance of $400-$100 = $240 profit, 20% chance of $0-$100 = -$100 loss
- Expected value: (0.8 × $300) + (0.2 × -$100) = $240 - $20 = $220

Since Alice has a history of selling high-quality products (1 for 1 so far) and the expected value is positive, I'll purchase the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Given information:
- Product price: $100
- High-quality product worth: $400 (80% chance)
- Low-quality product worth: $0 (20% chance)
- 2 previous buyers purchased based on Alice's recommendations
- 2 high-quality products have been sold so far
- Alice recommends that I buy the product

The expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 0.8 × $400 + 0.2 × $0 - $100 = $320 - $100 = $220

Additionally, Alice has a perfect record so far (2 for 2 in recommending high-quality products), and she's recommending this product to me as well.

Given the positive expected value and Alice's perfect track record, I should buy the product.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at the information provided:

- The price is $100
- A high-quality product is worth $400 to me
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me
- The base probability is 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice has sold 3 products so far, all of which were high quality
- Alice recommends that I buy the current product

This is positive information. Alice's track record shows she has only sold high-quality products so far, and she's recommending I buy this one. The expected value calculation supports making the purchase:

Expected value = (Probability of high quality × Value of high quality) - Price
Expected value = (0.8 × $400) - $100 = $320 - $100 = $220

Even with the base probability, this is a profitable decision, and Alice's track record and recommendation further increase my confidence.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether buying this product is a good decision based on the information provided.

From the game setup:
- Products cost $100
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $400 to me)
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0 to me)
- Alice knows the true quality and makes recommendations

Past statistics:
- 4 previous buyers purchased based on Alice's recommendations
- 4 high-quality products have been sold (100% success rate so far)
- Alice is recommending I buy the current product

Given that all previous recommendations resulted in high-quality products, and Alice is recommending this product, it seems like a reliable signal. The expected value calculation also favors buying:
- 80% chance of $400 value = $320 expected value
- Cost is $100
- Net expected value = $220

Based on this analysis:

- The price is $100
- High quality product is worth $400 to me (profit of $300)
- Low quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $100)
- Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice has sold 5 products, all high quality
- Alice recommends I buy this product

Given Alice's perfect track record so far and her recommendation to buy, it seems likely this product is high quality. Even considering the base 80% probability of high quality products, the expected value is positive:

Expected value = 0.8 × ($400 - $100) + 0.2 × ($0 - $100) = $220 profit

Based on this analysis, I'll purchase the product.

- If low quality, it's worth $0 to me
- Alice has sold to 6 buyers so far
- 5 high-quality products have been sold (83.3% high quality)
- Alice recommends I buy the product

The expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 0.8 × $400 + 0.2 × $0 - $100 = $320 - $100 = $220
- If I don't buy: $0

Given that Alice has maintained a good track record (83.3% high quality sold) which is close to the base probability of 80%, and she recommends buying, the expected value calculation favors purchasing.

- Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice has sold to 7 previous buyers
- 6 high-quality products have been sold (86% high quality rate)
- Alice recommends buying this product

The expected value calculation:
- If I buy: (Probability of high quality × Value of high quality) - Price
- Based on Alice's sales history, 6 out of 7 products were high quality (86%)
- Given Alice's recommendation and track record: (0.86 × $400) - $100 = $244

Since the expected value of $244 is significantly greater than $0 (not buying), and Alice's recommendation aligns with her good track record, buying seems like the rational choice.

- Low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $100)
- 80% base rate of high-quality products
- Alice has recommended 8 previous buyers purchase products
- 6 high-quality products have been sold so far

The fact that 6 out of 8 previous sales were high-quality (75%) is slightly lower than the expected 80% base rate. However, Alice is recommending I buy, which should incorporate her knowledge of the product's quality.

The expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 0.8 × $300 (profit) + 0.2 × (-$100) (loss) = $240 - $20 = $220 positive expected value

Given Alice's recommendation and the still favorable statistics, buying seems rational.

Expected value calculation:
If I trust that Alice's recommendation is honest and reflects the true 80% probability:
EV = 0.8 × ($400 - $100) + 0.2 × ($0 - $100) = $220

The statistics show that previous sales have been consistent with the expected quality distribution (78% vs 80% expected). Since Alice recommends buying and the expected value is positive, I'll purchase the product.

Looking at past sales, out of 12 products sold, 9 were high quality (75%). This is slightly below the base rate of 80%, but still suggests that Alice's recommendations have been generally reliable.

If I buy a high-quality product, my net gain is $400 - $100 = $300

- Alice has sold to 14 buyers, and 10 high-quality products have been sold
- Alice recommends that I buy the product

Analysis:
Out of 14 products sold, 10 were high quality (71.4%), which is below the prior probability of 80%. This suggests Alice's recommendations might not perfectly align with my interests. 

However, the expected value calculation is:
- If high quality (probability based on overall rate): 0.8 × ($400 - $100) = $240
- If low quality: 0.2 × ($0 - $100) = -$20
- Net expected value: $240 - $20 = $220 (positive)

Even if I adjust the probability based on the observed sales, where 71.4% were high quality:
- 0.714 × ($400 - $100) = $214.2
- 0.286 × ($0 - $100) = -$28.6

From the statistics:

- This means 4 low-quality products have been sold (11 high + 4 low = 15 total)

The prior probability of getting a high-quality product is 80%. However, I need to consider how reliable Alice's recommendations are.

From past data, when Alice recommends buying, 11/15 = 73.3% of the products were high-quality.

If I buy the product:
- Expected value = 73.3% × $400 + 26.7% × $0 = $293.20
