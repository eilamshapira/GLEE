Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality (50%): $1,250,000 (profit of $250,000)
   - Low quality (50%): $0 (loss of $1,000,000)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (50% × $1,250,000) + (50% × $0) = $625,000

4. The expected value ($625,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000)

5. There's no historical data to validate Alice's trustworthiness
   
6. Although Alice recommends buying, without any track record, this recommendation carries uncertain weight

Given that the expected value is significantly below the purchase price and there's no historical data to build trust, it would be financially prudent to decline.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Expected value calculation:
   * 50% chance of high quality ($1,250,000) = $625,000
   * 50% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
   * Total expected value = $625,000

3. Considerations:
   * No prior sales history to base decision on
   * Alice recommends buying
   * However, Alice's incentive is to sell regardless of quality
   * Expected value ($625,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000)

Since the expected value is less than the asking price, and there's no historical data to trust Alice's recommendation, it would be financially unwise to purchase.
