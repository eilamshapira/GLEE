Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the statistics provided:
- Alice made 2 sales.
- Both of these sales were high-quality products.

Given that Alice is recommending you to buy the product, the past outcomes were consistently high quality, which increases the likelihood that this recommendation is also for a high-quality product.

Therefore, the decision to buy the product is logical. Here is my decision:

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make a decision, let's consider the following:

1. **Probability of High Quality Given Alice's Recommendation**:
   - Alice's recommendation has led to 3 successful high-quality sales so far, indicating she might only recommend high-quality products.
   - The provided statistics show a 100% success rate for Alice's recommendations. 

2. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - Probability of high quality (given recommendation) â‰ˆ 100%
   - Expected Value if bought = Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality Product + Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality Product
   - Expected Value = 1 * $12,000 + 0 * $0 = $12,000

3. **Price vs Value**:
   - The product price is $10,000.
   - The expected value exceeds the price.

Based on the above analysis, where the expected value of the product exceeds its cost due to the presumed effectiveness of Alice's recommendations, it would be beneficial to proceed with the purchase.
