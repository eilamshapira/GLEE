Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes""}

Explanation:
At each round, the probability of a high-quality item is 80%, and the probability of a low-quality item is 20%. The price of the item is $1,000,000. The value of a high-quality item is $2,000,000, and the value of a low-quality item is $0.

The expected value of buying an item is:
(0.8 * $2,000,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $1,600,000

Since the expected value of $1,600,000 is greater than the purchase price of $1,000,000, the optimal decision is to always buy the item. This strategy maximizes the expected return, regardless of the outcomes of previous rounds."
