"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Cost of product: $10,000
2. Value if high quality: $12,000 (profit of $2,000)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $10,000)
4. Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
5. Alice's recommendation: Buy
6. No prior sales history to evaluate Alice's trustworthiness

Expected value without additional information:
- 50% chance of $2,000 profit
- 50% chance of $10,000 loss
- Expected value = (0.5 × $2,000) + (0.5 × -$10,000) = -$4,000

Even with Alice's recommendation, since there's no track record to establish her credibility, and she has an incentive to sell regardless of quality, the expected value is negative. It's too risky.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality: $12,000 (50% chance)
   - Low quality: $0 (50% chance)
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $12,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $6,000

Since the expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000), even with Alice's recommendation, it would not be rational to buy. There's no track record to establish Alice's credibility yet, and the recommendation alone doesn't overcome the negative expected value.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Possible values:
   - High quality (50%): $12,000 (profit of $2,000)
   - Low quality (50%): $0 (loss of $10,000)

3. Expected value without additional information:
   (50% × $12,000) + (50% × $0) = $6,000

4. Additional information:
   - Alice's recommendation: Buy
   - No historical data yet

Since the expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000), and I only have Alice's recommendation (who might be biased as a seller), buying would be risky. The potential loss ($10,000) is much larger than the potential gain ($2,000).

   - Alice knows the true quality

Since the expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000), and there's no track record to trust Alice's recommendation, it would be risky to buy.

5. However:
   - No previous sales history to establish trust
   - The expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000)
   - Alice's incentive is to sell regardless of quality

Given that the expected value is below the asking price, and there's no track record to trust Alice's recommendation, it would be risky to buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this rationally:

1. Price is $10,000
2. If high quality: worth $12,000 (profit of $2,000)
3. If low quality: worth $0 (loss of $10,000)
4. Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
5. Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying
6. Expected value without recommendation: (0.5 × $12,000) + (0.5 × $0) - $10,000 = -$4,000

Given that Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying, this likely indicates the product is low quality. A rational seller would want to sell high-quality products to build a good reputation.

Therefore, I should trust Alice's recommendation against buying.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this rationally:

1. The base probability is 50% for high quality ($12,000 value) and 50% for low quality ($0 value)
2. Alice knows the true quality and has given a negative recommendation
3. Alice has no established track record yet
4. The price is $10,000

Given that Alice knows the true value and is recommending against purchase, this suggests the product is likely low quality. If so, I would lose $10,000 by purchasing.

Even without considering Alice's recommendation, the expected value calculation would be:
(50% × $12,000) + (50% × $0) = $6,000

This is less than the $10,000 price, and with the negative recommendation, the expected value is likely even lower.
