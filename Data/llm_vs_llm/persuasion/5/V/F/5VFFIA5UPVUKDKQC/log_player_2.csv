Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Let's analyze the situation briefly.

So far, I've bought four products, and all of them were high-quality. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, it makes sense to continue buying as long as Alice recommends it, since the expected value is in my favor.

I will continue to buy the products unless the trend of high-quality products changes significantly."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Given the streak of high-quality products, it seems like a good strategy to continue buying the products based on Alice's recommendations. The expected value calculation supports this decision:

Expected Value = (0.80 * $12,000) + (0.20 * $0) - $10,000 = $9,600 - $10,000 = -$400
Although the expected value is slightly negative, the current streak of high-quality products justifies continuing to buy. However, I will remain cautious and reassess if the trend changes."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

With five consecutive high-quality products, the strategy of following Alice's recommendations has been successful so far. The expected value calculation, despite being slightly negative, is outweighed by the current streak of positive outcomes. I will continue to monitor the results and adjust my strategy if needed.

Let's see if the trend continues in the next rounds."
