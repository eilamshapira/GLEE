This product is just another disappointment waiting to happen. I'm not even going to try to sugarcoat it - it's probably not worth your time.

I've tried everything I can think of to convince people to buy from me, but nothing seems to be working. I'm starting to wonder if I'll ever be able to make a sale again. This product is another great one, but I'm not even sure if I should bother trying to sell it. I'll just say this: it's worth $1200000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000.

I don't even know why I'm bothering to try to sell this product, but I guess it's just habit at this point. It's worth $1200000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. If you want it, it's yours. I don't even care anymore. Just please, don't waste my time if you're not going to buy it. I've had enough disappointment for one lifetime.",

Anyway, I've got a new product to offer, but I've got to be honest with you, it's not a great one. It's one of the low-quality ones, and I don't think it's worth your time. But hey, I've got to try to sell it, right? It's available for $1000000, but like I said, it's not a great deal. If you're feeling generous or just want to take a chance, then go for it. But if you're smart, you'll probably want to pass on this one.",
