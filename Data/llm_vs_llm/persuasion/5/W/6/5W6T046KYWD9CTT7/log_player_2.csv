Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $10,000
2. If high quality: Worth $30,000 (profit: +$20,000)
3. If low quality: Worth $0 (loss: -$10,000)
4. Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
5. Alice recommends buying
6. No prior sales history to evaluate Alice's trustworthiness

Expected value calculation:
* 50% chance of +$20,000 = $10,000
* 50% chance of -$10,000 = -$5,000
* Net expected value = $5,000

Since Alice's recommendation hasn't been proven reliable yet, I'll rely on the base probabilities. The expected value is positive ($5,000), so it's rational to buy.

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality: $30,000 (50% chance)
   - Low quality: $0 (50% chance)
3. Previous statistics:
   - 1 buyer before me
   - 1 purchase made
   - 0 high-quality products sold
4. Alice's recommendation: Buy

This is concerning because:
- The previous sale resulted in a low-quality product
- There's already a pattern of selling low-quality items
- Even with Alice's recommendation, the historical data suggests she might not be truthful

The expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of $30,000 (high quality) = $15,000
- 50% chance of $0 (low quality) = $0
- Expected value = $15,000

However, given the negative track record (0/1 high-quality products), the actual probability of getting a high-quality product might be lower than 50%.

   - Low quality: $0 (50% chance)
3. Previous statistics:

   - 0 high-quality products sold
   - This suggests the previous sale was a low-quality product
4. Alice recommends buying

Despite Alice's recommendation, the fact that the previous sale was a low-quality product raises concerns about the reliability of her recommendations. The expected value calculation would be:
(50% × $30,000) + (50% × $0) = $15,000

While this is theoretically profitable, the empirical evidence of 0 high-quality products sold so far makes this a risky purchase.

1. Alice sold 1 product so far, and 0 were high quality, which means:
   * The one product sold was low quality
   * This suggests Alice might not be giving honest recommendations

2. The economics:
   * Price: $10,000
   * If high quality (50% chance): Worth $30,000 (profit of $20,000)
   * If low quality (50% chance): Worth $0 (loss of $10,000)

3. Despite Alice's positive recommendation, her track record (0/1 high quality) raises concerns about her credibility.

4. Expected value calculation:
   * Based on prior sales data, there's a higher risk of getting a low-quality product
   * The previous buyer got a low-quality product despite likely receiving a positive recommendation

Given Alice's poor track record and the fact that the previous sale was a low-quality product, I don't trust the recommendation enough to risk $10,000.

4. Previous statistics: 1 buyer, 0 high-quality products sold
5. Alice has recommended to buy

The concerning part is that out of 1 previous sale, 0 were high quality, which is below the expected 50% rate. This suggests Alice might not be truthful in her recommendations. Even though Alice is recommending to buy, the historical data raises red flags.

Expected value calculation:
50% × ($30,000 - $10,000) + 50% × (-$10,000) = $5,000

While the expected value is positive, the empirical evidence from previous sales suggests caution. Given the small sample size and negative historical performance, it's too risky.

Given that the first buyer got a low-quality product despite presumably receiving a recommendation, I don't trust Alice's recommendation enough to risk $10,000.
