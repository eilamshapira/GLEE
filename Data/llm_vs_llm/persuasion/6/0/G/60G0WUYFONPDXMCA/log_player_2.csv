Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice recommends buying, there's no information to base this recommendation on. Since there's a 50% chance of the product being worthless, it's too risky to buy at the given price.  The expected value of buying is:

(0.5 * $1,250,000) + (0.5 * $0) - $1,000,000 = -$375,000 

This means, on average, you'd lose money by buying."
"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since no products have been sold yet, there's no information on the quality of previous products. Alice recommending the product provides a slight positive signal, but it's not enough to change the odds significantly. The potential gain from a high-quality product ($1,250,000 - $1,000,000 = $250,000) outweighs the potential loss ($1,000,000).  The 50% chance of getting a high-quality product makes it a gamble worth taking in this scenario."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information to go on. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the product is a positive signal, as she has no incentive to mislead us. 
* **Potential Gain:** The potential upside is significant ($1,250,000) while the potential downside is limited ($1,000,000).
* **Risk vs. Reward:** In this case, the potential reward outweighs the risk, especially considering the limited data available. 

While there's a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the chance of getting a high-quality product and making a profit is worth taking."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since she doesn't recommend the product, it's likely she has seen something that suggests it is low quality. 

The fact that two high-quality products have been sold in the past is not enough to overcome Alice's recommendation. This is because:

* **Alice has more information:** She likely has access to more information about the products than the buyers.
* **Risk aversion:** The potential gain is $250,000, but the potential loss is $1,000,000. It's not worth the risk given the information available."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, the seller, is recommending you buy the product. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality.  Since she doesn't know your valuation, she is incentivized to sell high-quality products to maximize her own profit.
* **Previous sales data:** The data shows 100% of the products sold so far have been high quality.  While this is a small sample size, it's a positive indicator.

**It's important to note:**  Even with this information, there is still a 50% chance that the product is low quality.  However, the potential gain from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of a low-quality product."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has a perfect record so far, it's important to remember:

* **Alice's recommendation is based on the specific product *she* has.**  We don't know if this one is high or low quality. 
* **The odds are 50/50.**  Even with a perfect track record, there's a 50% chance this product is worthless to you.
* **The cost is high.** $1,000,000 is a significant risk for a 50/50 gamble.

Since Alice isn't recommending the product, and the risk is high, it's best to pass."

**Explanation:**

The information provided is very useful.  Here's the reasoning:

* **Perfect Record:**  Alice has a perfect track record of recommending only high-quality products, which have all been bought. 
* **Negative Recommendation:** However, Alice is *not* recommending this product. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.

**Decision:** The risk is too high. The potential reward ($1,250,000) is significant, but the potential loss ($1,000,000) is equally significant. It's better to pass and wait for a product Alice recommends."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:** Alice's recommendations have resulted in 100% high-quality products being sold so far. This is a strong indicator that her recommendations are reliable.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a 50% chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($1,250,000) is significantly greater than the potential loss ($1,000,000). 

Given Alice's perfect track record and the potential for a significant profit, it's logical to accept the recommendation and buy the product."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since all previous buyers who followed her recommendation ended up with high-quality products, it's highly likely that the current product is low quality. The fact that the seller is not recommending it further strengthens this belief. 

While there's still a chance the product is high quality, the risk is too high given the potential loss of $1,000,000."

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect track record:**  Alice has recommended 6 products, and all 6 were high-quality. This suggests she has a perfect ability to identify high-quality products.
* **Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, reinforcing her past success rate.

Since the potential profit ($250,000) significantly outweighs the potential loss ($1,000,000), and Alice has a perfect track record, it's rational to buy the product."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since all 7 previous buyers who purchased based on her recommendation got high-quality products, it's highly likely that the current product is low-quality.  Given the 50/50 odds and the fact that a low-quality product is worthless to you, it's a better strategy to pass and avoid the potential loss."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, despite knowing the product's quality, does not recommend buying. This is a strong indicator that the product is likely low quality.
* **Past sales data:** 100% of the products sold so far were high quality. This could suggest that Alice is only recommending products she knows are high quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of a high-quality product is significant, but the risk of a low-quality product is total loss. Given the lack of positive signals and the high risk, passing is the more prudent choice."

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:** Alice has sold 8 products, and all of them were high quality. This suggests that Alice has perfect information about the quality of the products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is not recommending the purchase. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality, even though her past record is perfect. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of a high-quality product ($1,250,000) is significant, but the risk of a low-quality product ($0) is equally significant. 

Given the information available, it's highly probable that the current product is low quality.  Therefore, it's wiser to pass on the product and avoid the potential loss."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is based on her knowledge of the product's quality. Since she does not recommend buying, it implies that the product is likely low-quality.  

Even though all previously recommended products were high-quality, the probability of getting a low-quality product is still 50%.  Given the significant risk of getting a worthless product, it's best to pass on this offer."
