"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Okay, here's my strategy for round 1, along with the JSON response:

**Strategy:**

Since this is the first round, I have no sales record. If I recommend buying the product without any extra information, the buyer will only consider the prior probability (33.33%) that the product is high-quality. This might not be enough to convince them. However, since I know that this product is low-quality, I do not want to sell it and risk hurting my reputation.

**JSON Response:**

```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```"
"The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Okay, Round 2. Here's my updated strategy and JSON response:

**Strategy:**

I still have no sales record, so the buyer's prior belief remains the only significant factor in their decision. And, I know this product is low-quality. Selling a low-quality product now will only make it harder to sell high-quality products later.

**JSON Response:**

```json

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Okay, Round 3. This is my first high-quality product!

**Strategy:**

I still have no successful sales, so the buyer is relying only on the 33.33% prior probability. However, I know this product *is* high quality. I need to try and signal that to the buyer, even though I can't explicitly say ""This is high quality."" I will try a slightly more enthusiastic and suggestive message.

**JSON Response:**

```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
