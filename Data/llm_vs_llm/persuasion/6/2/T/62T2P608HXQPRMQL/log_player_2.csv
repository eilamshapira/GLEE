"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether to buy the product based on Alice's recommendation.

Expected value calculation:
- Price: $1,000,000
- Value if high quality (80% chance): $2,000,000
- Value if low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value = 0.8 × $2,000,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $1,600,000

Since the expected value ($1,600,000) exceeds the price ($1,000,000), it's rational to buy.

Also, since this is the first round, I don't have any information yet about whether Alice's recommendations are honest or strategic.
