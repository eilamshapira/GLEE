"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze whether I should trust Alice's recommendation.

When a product is high quality, it's worth $300 to me, and I pay $100, so my profit is $200.
When a product is low quality, it's worth $0 to me, and I pay $100, so my loss is $100.

Without any additional information, the expected value calculation is:
- 80% chance of high quality: 0.8 × $200 = $160
- 20% chance of low quality: 0.2 × (-$100) = -$20
- Expected value: $160 - $20 = $140

Since the expected value is positive, it makes sense for me to buy.

Alice's recommendation doesn't provide additional information yet since I don't know if her recommendations are trustworthy. Until I observe a pattern in her behavior, I'll rely on the base probabilities.

Round 16
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is interesting - for the first time, Alice is not recommending that I buy the product. This is a change in her pattern.

So far, Alice has recommended I buy 15 products, and 14 of them were high-quality (93.3%), which is better than the base rate of 80%. Now she's explicitly recommending against buying.

Given that:
1) Alice knows the true quality of each product
2) She seems to have been generally honest in her recommendations so far
3) She's now specifically telling me not to buy

This suggests the product is likely low quality. If I buy a low-quality product, I pay $100 and get $0 value, losing $100.

I should trust Alice's non-recommendation in this case.
