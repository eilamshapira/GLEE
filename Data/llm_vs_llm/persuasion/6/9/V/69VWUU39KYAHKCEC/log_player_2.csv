"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Even without a recommendation from Alice, the odds are against me. There's a 66.67% chance the product is worth $0 to me and only a 33.33% chance it's worth $300.  The risk is too high for a potential reward that I'm not even sure exists in this particular round."
