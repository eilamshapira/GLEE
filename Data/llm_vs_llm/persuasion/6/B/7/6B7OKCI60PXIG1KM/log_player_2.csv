Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $12,500
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.3333 × $12,500) + (0.6667 × $0) = $4,166.25

Since the expected value ($4,166.25) is less than the price ($10,000), even with Alice's recommendation, it would not be rational to buy the product. There's no track record yet to validate Alice's reliability.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33%): $12,500 (profit of $2,500)
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0 (loss of $10,000)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (33.33% × $12,500) + (66.67% × $0) = $4,166.25

The expected value ($4,166.25) is less than the price ($10,000), even with Alice's recommendation. Since there's no prior sales history to validate Alice's reliability, and the expected value is significantly below the asking price, it would be financially risky to purchase.

2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $12,500

3. Expected value without additional information:
   (0.3333 × $12,500) + (0.6667 × $0) = $4,166.25

4. Additional information:
   - Alice does not recommend buying
   - As a seller, Alice would benefit from selling, so a negative recommendation likely means low quality

Given that Alice doesn't recommend buying and the expected value without any information is already below the asking price ($4,166.25 < $10,000), this is likely a low-quality product.

Since Alice is recommending the purchase, it might be more likely to be high quality. However, without any previous sales history to establish Alice's credibility, and with an expected value ($4,166.25) significantly below the asking price ($10,000), it would be too risky to purchase.

Since:

The rational decision would be not to buy.

The risk of loss ($10,000) is significantly higher than the potential profit ($2,500), and the probability favors a negative outcome.
