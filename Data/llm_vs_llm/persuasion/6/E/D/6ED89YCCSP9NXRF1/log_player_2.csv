Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's think about this:

1. Product price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 50% chance of $20,000 (high quality)
   - 50% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value without additional information: $10,000 (0.5 × $20,000 + 0.5 × $0)
4. Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying
5. Since Alice is a seller trying to make sales, if she doesn't recommend buying, it's likely she's being honest and the product is low quality

Given Alice's recommendation against buying and considering she has incentive to sell, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. In this case, the product would be worth $0, making it a bad purchase at $10,000.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Price = $10,000
2. If high quality: Value = $20,000 (profit of $10,000)
   If low quality: Value = $0 (loss of $10,000)
3. Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
4. Alice recommends buying
5. No previous sales history to evaluate Alice's trustworthiness

Despite Alice's recommendation, without any track record to establish her credibility, I must rely on the base probabilities. With a 50% chance of either gaining $10,000 or losing $10,000, the expected value is $0.

Given that there's no way to verify Alice's trustworthiness yet and the neutral expected value, I'll play it safe.

3. Previous statistics:

Given that:
- Alice has been honest so far (1/1 high-quality sales)
- She's actively recommending this product
- The expected value with 50/50 odds ($10,000) equals the price

- If she's not recommending the purchase, it's likely a low-quality product
- A low-quality product would be worth $0 to me
- The price is $10,000

- Alice has been honest so far (2/2 high-quality sales)
- Alice is explicitly not recommending the purchase
- Given Alice's perfect track record, her negative recommendation is likely truthful

Given that Alice has demonstrated honesty in previous sales and is specifically advising against the purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality, which would be worth $0.

- Alice has a perfect track record so far
- Alice knows the true quality and has an incentive to maintain reputation
- Alice's recommendation is positive

3) Previous sales:
   - 3 buyers purchased
   - 2 high-quality products sold
   - This means 2/3 (66.67%) of sold products were high quality

Since Alice is recommending the purchase and has a track record of selling mostly high-quality products (66.67%), this seems like a positive signal. The expected value calculation would be:

With a 66.67% chance of high quality:
(66.67% × $20,000) + (33.33% × $0) = $13,334

Since the expected value ($13,334) is higher than the price ($10,000), and Alice's recommendation aligns with her good track record, I'll buy.
