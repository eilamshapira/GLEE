Let's explain briefly our reasoning in words (without compromising the JSON‐only answer):

Each product is a 50% chance proposition worth $200 (if high quality) but costing $100 (so +100 profit) and 50% chance worth $0 (–$100 loss). In isolation the act of buying has an expected net value of zero. However, you’re not coming to this decision blind: you see that two previous buyers, who followed Alice’s recommendations, ended up with products that turned out low quality—so 0 of the 2 sold items were high quality. If Alice’s sales record were coming from a recommendation that honestly signaled quality (for example, “buy” only when shown a high‐quality product), then you’d expect previous “buy” outcomes to be high quality. The fact that they were not strongly suggests that Alice’s recommendation is not conveying extra information about quality. 

Under these circumstances the offer essentially remains a coin‐flip (with an expected net of $0), but now your observations imply that her “buy” recommendation may even be a device to lure you into a bad deal. Given the evidence from past sales—and especially if you are risk averse—it is rational to pass on this product.

Thus, the decision is “no.”"

Let me explain briefly without giving away too many game details. You are offered a product with a 50–50 chance of being very good (worth $200) or very bad (worth $0) at a fixed price of $100. In a “fair‐coin” world the simple expected profit is 0. However, you also see the seller’s sales record: the two previous buyers got products that turned out to be low quality—even though you get a “buy” recommendation. If the seller’s recommendation were a reliable indicator, you’d expect at least some high-quality outcomes to have been sold by now. In equilibrium it appears that the “buy” recommendation isn’t pushing a positive edge to you but – if you follow it—leaves you exposed to a 50–50 gamble with the risk of losing $100 and the chance of gaining $100. 

For a risk neutral person this might be an indifferent proposition, but many buyers would shy away from such a symmetric gamble when past data suggests things aren’t as rosy as they might seem from the recommendation alone. In this game the statistical record (0 high–quality sales out of 2) tips the balance toward not buying.

Thus, my decision is to pass on the product."
