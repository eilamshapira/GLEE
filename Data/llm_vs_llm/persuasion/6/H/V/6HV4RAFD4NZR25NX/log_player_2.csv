"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether buying is worthwhile based on the expected value.

Given information:
- Price: $1,000,000
- Value if high quality: $4,000,000
- Value if low quality: $0
- Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality

Without any additional information, the expected value is:
0.8 × $4,000,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $3,200,000

Since the expected value ($3,200,000) exceeds the price ($1,000,000), it's rational to buy the product.

Round 12
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to reconsider the expected value given Alice's recommendation.

Alice has recommended every product so far, and they've all been high quality. This is the first time she's not recommending a purchase.

Given that:
- Alice knows the true quality of the product
- She's not recommending this product
- There's strong evidence she only recommends high-quality products

This suggests the current product is likely low quality. If it's low quality, it's worth $0 to me, which is less than the $1,000,000 price.

Based on Alice's negative recommendation, I should decline this purchase.

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
