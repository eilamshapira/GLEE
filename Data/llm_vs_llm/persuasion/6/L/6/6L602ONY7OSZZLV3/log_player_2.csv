Explanation: Given the statistics, Alice has sold 4 high-quality products out of 8, maintaining the expected 50% probability of high-quality products. Additionally, Alice is on a 2-product high-quality streak. Since the chance of getting a high-quality product is 50%, and the expected payoff is $3,000,000, it makes sense to purchase the product. The expected value of $3,000,000 * 0.5 = $1,500,000 is higher than the cost of $1,000,000, making it a rational decision to buy."
