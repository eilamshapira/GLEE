**Reasoning:**

While we don't know Alice's specific recommendation strategy, the fact she's advising against the purchase is a strong negative signal. 

* **Unknown Recommendation Logic:** We don't know if Alice is genuinely trying to help or if her recommendations are designed to maximize her own sales.
* **Potential Bias:** Even if Alice is well-intentioned, her recommendations might be unintentionally biased towards selling products, regardless of their quality. 
* **Limited Information:** Knowing two high-quality products were sold out of an unspecified number of total sales doesn't give us enough information to make an informed decision.

**Given the uncertainty and the negative recommendation, it's safer to pass on this offer.**"

{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we don't know how many total buyers there have been, the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product is a strong indicator against buying it. Here's why:

* **Unknown Recommendation Strategy:** We don't know Alice's strategy for making recommendations.  It's possible she recommends all products, in which case her recommendation means nothing. It's also possible she has a system that leans towards recommending high-quality products.
* **Risk Aversion:**  Given the 50/50 odds and the potential for a significant loss ($100), it's riskier to buy a product Alice doesn't recommend. 

**Without more information about Alice's recommendation history and strategy, it's safer to pass.**"

Here's why:

* **Favorable Odds:** Even though we don't know how Alice's recommendation system works, the historical data is compelling.  A 100% success rate for high-quality products being sold suggests that her recommendations are highly accurate. 
* **Positive Expected Value:**  With a 50% chance of the product being worth $400 and a 50% chance of it being worth $0, the expected value is ($400 * 0.5) + ($0 * 0.5) = $200.  This is significantly higher than the $100 price tag.

Given the information, the potential reward outweighs the risk.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the provided probability of a product being high quality is 50%, the seller's track record suggests otherwise. With a 100% success rate of selling only high-quality products so far, there might be a bias in the selection process, the seller's recommendation, or some other hidden factor not accounted for in the initial probability. 

Given this information, it's strategically advantageous to trust the trend and purchase the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 10 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 10 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 11th buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's how to approach this decision:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Product Value:** A high-quality product is worth $400 to you, while a low-quality one is worth $0.
* **Price:** The product costs $100.
* **Probability:** There's a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product and a 50% chance of getting a low-quality one.
* **Seller Information:** Alice has sold 10 products, all of which turned out to be high-quality. However, we don't know how many buyers declined before these 10 purchases.

**Decision Time**

The crucial piece here is that we don't have the full picture of Alice's sales.  Did she recommend the product to 20 people, and only 10 bought it (meaning the other 10 saw it was low quality)? Or did 10 people in a row buy without hesitation? 

* **Scenario 1: Selective Buying:** If many buyers before you declined, it suggests that Alice's recommendation might be influenced by the product's quality (i.e., she might only recommend the good ones). 
* **Scenario 2: Blind Luck:**  If all previous buyers purchased without knowing the quality, the 100% high-quality rate could just be a lucky streak.

**Without more information about how Alice's recommendations relate to product quality in the past, it's a gamble.**

**My Decision (Based on Risk Aversion):**

Since we don't have enough information to confidently assess Alice's recommendation, I'm going to be risk-averse. 

```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:** The potential loss of $100 outweighs the potential gain of $300, given the uncertainty. 

**Important Note:** If we had more data points and could establish a stronger correlation between Alice's recommendations and product quality, the decision might change."
