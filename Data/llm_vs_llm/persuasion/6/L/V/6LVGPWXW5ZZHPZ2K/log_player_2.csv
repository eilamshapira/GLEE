Alice's message: Hello! I'm offering a fantastic product today. Given that 80% of my products are high-quality, and considering the potential upside, this could be a very worthwhile investment. Think of the possibilities!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this proposition carefully.

The product costs $1,000,000.
- If high quality (80% chance): worth $4,000,000 to me
- If low quality (20% chance): worth $0 to me

Expected value = (0.8 × $4,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $3,200,000

Since the expected value ($3,200,000) exceeds the cost ($1,000,000), this appears to be a good purchase from a purely mathematical perspective. Alice hasn't revealed the specific quality of this product, but the general odds favor making the purchase.

Alice's message: Good day! I'm back with another offer. My track record speaks for itself – I consistently deliver quality. With the high likelihood of this being a premium product, it's a chance to significantly increase your portfolio's value. Don't miss out!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this carefully:

- The prior probability of a high-quality product is 80%
- Alice has sold 1 product previously, and it was high-quality
- Alice is recommending I buy the current product
- The fixed price is $1,000,000
- A high-quality product is worth $4,000,000 to me (gain of $3,000,000)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000)

Given the high prior probability, Alice's track record of 100% high-quality products sold, and the positive expected value (0.8 × $3,000,000 - 0.2 × $1,000,000 = $2,200,000), it makes economic sense to proceed with the purchase.

Alice's message: Greetings! I'm excited to present another product. Remember, the odds are in your favor! My products have an 80% chance of being top-tier. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a fixed price. Let's make a deal!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to carefully analyze this decision.

Alice offers a product for $1,000,000. If it's high quality (80% chance), it's worth $4,000,000 to me, giving me $3,000,000 in value. If it's low quality (20% chance), it's worth $0, meaning I lose $1,000,000.

Expected value = (0.8 × $3,000,000) + (0.2 × -$1,000,000) = $2,400,000 - $200,000 = $2,200,000

The statistics show Alice has sold 2 products to previous buyers, both high quality. This is consistent with the stated 80% probability of high quality products.

Alice's message doesn't provide specific information about the current product's quality. She's generally encouraging the purchase but doesn't explicitly state whether this particular product is high or low quality.

Based on the positive expected value and consistent track record, I should purchase.

Alice's message: Hello! I have a new product available. Given that the majority of my offerings are high-quality, this is a risk-adjusted opportunity to add significant value. Consider the potential returns – this could be a game changer!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this carefully. 

Alice has sold 3 products so far, and all 3 were high quality. This is a good track record. The prior probability of a product being high quality is 80%. 

Alice's message doesn't actually reveal whether the specific product she's offering me is high or low quality. She's emphasizing potential returns but not making a clear quality claim about this particular product.

Given:
- Prior probability of high quality: 80%
- Expected value calculation: (0.8 × $4,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $3,200,000
- Product price: $1,000,000

The expected value ($3,200,000) is greater than the price ($1,000,000), making this a positive expected value purchase even without additional information.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision about whether to purchase the product Alice is offering.

Let me analyze the situation:
- The product costs $1,000,000
- A high-quality product is worth $4,000,000 to me (a $3,000,000 profit)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (a $1,000,000 loss)
- There's an 80% prior probability of the product being high quality
- Alice has sold 4 products so far, and all 4 were high quality
- Alice knows the quality of the product she's offering me

Alice's perfect track record of selling only high-quality products so far is a positive signal. However, I need to be careful about reading too much into a small sample size. Her recommendation is positive but somewhat vague and doesn't provide specific information about this particular product's quality.

Given the prior probability of 80% for high quality, and the positive but limited evidence from past sales, I'll make my decision.

Alice's message: Good day! Another product is available. The odds are in your favor with an 80% chance of a high-quality product. This is a chance to diversify your portfolio with a potential high-value asset. Don't hesitate!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze whether to buy this product based on the expected value.

Facts:
- Product costs $1,000,000
- High-quality product (80% chance) is worth $4,000,000 to me
- Low-quality product (20% chance) is worth $0 to me
- 5 buyers so far have purchased products
- All 5 products sold were high-quality

The expected value of buying is:
(0.8 × $4,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) - $1,000,000 = $3,200,000 - $1,000,000 = $2,200,000

Since the expected value is positive and significantly higher than the cost, and Alice's track record shows only high-quality products have been sold so far, buying appears to be the rational choice.

Alice's message: Hello! I'm offering another product. Given my track record of high-quality offerings, this presents a compelling opportunity. This is a chance to acquire a valuable asset. Consider it an investment in your future!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Facts:
- The product costs $1,000,000
- High-quality product is worth $4,000,000 to me (profit: $3,000,000)
- Low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss: $1,000,000)
- Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice has sold to 6 buyers so far
- All 6 previous sales were high-quality products

Alice hasn't explicitly revealed the quality of my product, just made a positive recommendation. Her perfect track record of selling only high-quality products so far is encouraging, though she could be selective about which products she recommends.

Based on the prior probability of 80% high quality and the evidence of Alice's perfect track record, buying would be a positive expected value decision.

Expected value = (0.8 × $3,000,000) + (0.2 × -$1,000,000) = $2,400,000 - $200,000 = $2,200,000

- All 7 products sold were high-quality

Alice's sales record shows a perfect track record so far with 7/7 high-quality products sold. This is slightly better than the base 80% probability, but with a small sample size.

The expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of $4,000,000 value = $3,200,000
- 20% chance of $0 value = $0
- Total expected value = $3,200,000
- Cost = $1,000,000

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Alice has sold 8 products, and all 8 were high quality. This suggests that her recommendations have been reliable. However, I don't see where Alice has explicitly stated whether the current product is high or low quality, which is concerning.

Given that products have an 80% chance of being high quality, and Alice knows the true quality, I would expect her to clearly state the quality of this specific product rather than making a general statement about ""low-risk, high-reward"" and mentioning her history.

Without an explicit statement about this specific product's quality, I can't be confident in the purchase. The expected value calculation would be 0.8 × $4,000,000 = $3,200,000 if I were just using the prior probability, which exceeds the $1,000,000 price. However, Alice's failure to explicitly state this product's quality when she knows it raises concerns.

1. Prior probability: Any product has an 80% chance of being high quality.
2. Alice's track record: 8 buyers purchased, and 8 high-quality products were sold (100% success rate).

The expected value ($3,200,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($1,000,000), making this a positive expected value decision.

The expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of $4M value = $3.2M
- 20% chance of $0 value = $0

However, Alice doesn't explicitly reveal the quality of my specific product as mentioned in the game rules. The message is generic and doesn't indicate whether she randomly selected my product and is sharing its true quality.

Without clear information about my specific product's quality, I should rely on the base probability (80% chance of high quality).
