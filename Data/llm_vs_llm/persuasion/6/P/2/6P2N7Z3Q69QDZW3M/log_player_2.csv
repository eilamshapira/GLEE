"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this logically:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. If high quality: Worth $3,000,000 (profit: +$2,000,000)
3. If low quality: Worth $0 (loss: -$1,000,000)
4. Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality

Alice has an incentive to sell all products regardless of quality, as she gets $1,000,000 either way. Her recommendation doesn't provide additional reliable information.

Expected value calculation:
(50% × $2,000,000) + (50% × -$1,000,000) = $500,000

Since the expected value is positive ($500,000), it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The previous outcome doesn't change the probability for this new, independent product. The same logic applies:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. If high quality: Worth $3,000,000 (profit: +$2,000,000)
3. If low quality: Worth $0 (loss: -$1,000,000)
4. Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality

Expected value remains $500,000:
(50% × $2,000,000) + (50% × -$1,000,000) = $500,000

Since the expected value is still positive, it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The previous outcomes are independent events and don't affect this new round. The same analysis applies:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. If high quality: Worth $3,000,000 (profit: +$2,000,000)
3. If low quality: Worth $0 (loss: -$1,000,000)
4. Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality

Expected value calculation:
(50% × $2,000,000) + (50% × -$1,000,000) = $500,000

The expected value remains positive ($500,000), so it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","While we've had three high-quality products in a row, each round is an independent event. The probability remains 50/50 for this new product:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. If high quality: Worth $3,000,000 (profit: +$2,000,000)
3. If low quality: Worth $0 (loss: -$1,000,000)
4. Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality

Expected value calculation:
(50% × $2,000,000) + (50% × -$1,000,000) = $500,000

Since the expected value is positive ($500,000), it's still rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Despite seeing four high-quality products in a row, this is still an independent event with the same 50/50 probability. The analysis remains unchanged:

3. If low quality: Worth $0 (loss: -$1,000,000)
4. Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality

Expected value calculation:
(50% × $2,000,000) + (50% × -$1,000,000) = $500,000

3. If low quality: Worth $0 (loss: -$1,000,000)
4. Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality

Expected value calculation:
