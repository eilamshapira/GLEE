Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully.

Given information:
- The product costs $10,000
- High-quality products (worth $12,500) have 80% probability
- Low-quality products (worth $0) have 20% probability
- Alice recommends buying the product
- No previous sales data is available

Expected value calculation:
- If I buy: (0.8 × $12,500) + (0.2 × $0) - $10,000 = $10,000 - $10,000 = $0

This is a neutral expected value. However, Alice has incentive to sell all products regardless of quality, so her recommendation doesn't provide additional information about the product quality.

Since the expected value is exactly break-even, I'll decline to purchase.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to consider this decision carefully. 

Alice's recommendation could be informative, but I have no prior history to judge her credibility. 

The base probability of a high-quality product is 80%, which means:
- Expected value = 0.8 × $12,500 + 0.2 × $0 = $10,000
- This equals the asking price of $10,000

Since the expected value exactly equals the price, I'm indifferent between buying and not buying. However, without any track record of Alice's recommendations, I'll take the recommendation at face value.

"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully to make an informed decision.

The product costs $10,000, and:
- If it's high quality (80% chance), it's worth $12,500 to me (profit of $2,500)
- If it's low quality (20% chance), it's worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)

Alice has sold 1 product so far, and it was high quality. Alice is now recommending that I buy the current product.

My expected value calculation:
0.8 × $12,500 + 0.2 × $0 = $10,000

This equals the price, making me roughly indifferent. However, Alice's recommendation provides additional positive information, slightly tipping the balance in favor of buying.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision:

- Price: $10,000
- Value if high quality: $12,500 (profit of $2,500)
- Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $10,000)
- Prior probability of high quality: 80%
- Alice has sold 2 products, both high quality
- Alice is recommending I buy

Alice's recommendation and perfect track record (2/2 high quality) suggest this product is likely high quality. The expected value calculation:

80% chance of $12,500 = $10,000
20% chance of $0 = $0
Total expected value = $10,000

Since the expected value equals the price, and Alice's recommendation and track record are positive signals, I'll take the offer.

- Low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- Prior probability: 80% chance of high quality, 20% chance of low quality
- Alice has sold 3 products so far, all high-quality
- Alice recommends I buy the product

Alice has a perfect track record of selling only high-quality products so far. Her recommendation to buy suggests this product is likely high-quality too. The expected value of buying is positive:
- 80% chance of $2,500 profit = $2,000
- 20% chance of $10,000 loss = -$2,000
- Net expected value = $0

However, Alice's perfect track record and recommendation together increase my confidence that this is a high-quality product, making the expected value positive.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'll analyze this decision step by step:

1) Price of product: $10,000
2) Value to me: $12,500 if high quality, $0 if low quality
3) Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
4) Alice's track record: 4 out of 4 previous products were high quality
5) Alice is recommending I buy the product

This is a positive expected value purchase:
- If I buy, my expected value is: 0.8 × $12,500 + 0.2 × $0 = $10,000
- Alice has demonstrated perfect accuracy so far (4/4 high quality)
- Alice is recommending I buy, suggesting she believes it's high quality

Given Alice's perfect track record and her recommendation to buy, the probability of high quality likely exceeds the prior 80%, making the expected value greater than the $10,000 cost.

Facts:
- Price: $10,000

- Value of low-quality product: $0 (loss: $10,000)
- Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Previous sales: 5 buyers purchased, and all 5 received high-quality products
- Alice recommends I buy the product

Since Alice has a perfect track record (5/5 high-quality products sold) and is now recommending this product, it suggests she's being honest with her recommendations. The expected value calculation is:

0.8 × $12,500 + 0.2 × $0 = $10,000

This equals the price, so it would be a fair transaction even without Alice's recommendation. With her perfect track record and positive recommendation, the probability of high quality is likely higher than 80%.

Alice seems to have a perfect track record of only selling high-quality products, and she's recommending this product to me. This suggests that Alice is being truthful in her recommendations.

The expected value calculation:
- If I trust Alice's recommendation and past record: Very high probability of high quality
- If high quality: $12,500 - $10,000 = $2,500 profit

If I purchase the product for $10,000:
- If it's high quality (worth $12,500), I gain $2,500
- If it's low quality (worth $0), I lose $10,000

Given the information:
- The base probability is 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- All 7 previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendations received high-quality products
- Alice is recommending I buy this product

The perfect track record of Alice's recommendations suggests her recommendations are reliable. Since she's recommending I buy, and all her previous recommendations led to high-quality products, it's reasonable to trust this recommendation.

Expected value = 0.8 × $2,500 + 0.2 × (-$10,000) = $2,000 - $2,000 = $0

However, Alice's perfect track record suggests the probability of high quality given her recommendation is higher than the base rate of 80%, making the expected value positive.

The product costs $10,000. If it's high quality, it's worth $12,500 to me (profit of $2,500). If it's low quality, it's worth $0 (loss of $10,000).

Alice has recommended 8 previous buyers to purchase, and 7 of those products were high quality. This means that among Alice's recommendations, 7/8 or 87.5% were high quality.

Alice is now recommending that I buy the product, which increases the likelihood that it's high quality based on her track record.

The expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 0.875 × $12,500 + 0.125 × $0 - $10,000 = $10,937.50 - $10,000 = $937.50

Since the expected value of buying is positive, I should purchase the product.

- Fixed price is $10,000
- Alice recommends buying

- I would be the 10th buyer

Expected value calculation:

Analysis:

- Alice's recommendation seems to have some predictive value
- Expected value if I buy: 0.9 × $2,500 - 0.1 × $10,000 = $2,250 - $1,000 = $1,250 (positive)

Alice is recommending I buy, and her track record shows she's sold high-quality products at a rate slightly better than the base rate (81.8% vs 80%). This suggests her recommendations have some value.

The fixed price is $10,000. A high-quality product gives me $12,500 (profit of $2,500), while a low-quality product gives me $0 (loss of $10,000).

From the statistics:
- 13 buyers have purchased so far
- 11 high-quality products have been sold
- This means 11/13 ≈ 84.6% of sold products were high quality

The prior probability of a high-quality product is 80%. Alice's recommendation provides additional information, but I should evaluate her incentives. Since Alice knows the product quality and my valuation, she might be incentivized to recommend buying regardless of quality.

However, with 11/13 of previous sold products being high quality, this suggests Alice's recommendations have some reliability. The actual proportion of high-quality products sold (84.6%) is also higher than the baseline probability (80%).

Given:
- Expected value calculation: (0.8 × $12,500) + (0.2 × $0) = $10,000
