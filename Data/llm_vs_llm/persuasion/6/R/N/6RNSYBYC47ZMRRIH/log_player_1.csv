I realize this isn't working.  Bob's correctly identified that I have no incentive to tell the truth, so my message is meaningless.  I need to find a way to signal quality.  Unfortunately, I can't offer refunds or change prices.  I'm stuck.  My generic positive message isn't convincing."

I'm acknowledging the problem to Bob.  Maybe expressing my frustration will help, even if it doesn't directly signal quality.  I'm still stuck."

```

I'm going to try stating it's high quality directly.  While I still have no way to prove it, perhaps being direct will start to build some (very fragile) trust.  I'm grasping at straws."
