Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Expected value calculation:
* 80% chance of high quality: 0.8 × $1,250,000 = $1,000,000
* 20% chance of low quality: 0.2 × $0 = $0
* Total expected value: $1,000,000

2. Cost of product: $1,000,000

3. Considerations:
* The expected value equals the cost
* Alice is recommending to buy
* No prior sales history to reference
* Alice's incentive is to sell regardless of quality

While this is a neutral expected value situation, Alice's recommendation provides a slight positive signal, even though we should be cautious about potential bias.

1. Base probability:
- 80% chance of high quality ($1,250,000 value)
- 20% chance of low quality ($0 value)

2. Previous data:
- 1 buyer so far
- 1 purchase made
- 1 high-quality product sold
- This suggests Alice's recommendations have been accurate

3. Current situation:
- Alice is recommending to buy
- Price is $1,000,000
- Expected value with 80% probability:
  (0.8 × $1,250,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $1,000,000

4. Risk assessment:
- Alice's track record shows honesty
- Her recommendation aligns with the favorable base probability
- Expected value matches the asking price

Based on these factors, I'll accept Alice's recommendation.

1. Prior statistics:
- 4 buyers purchased products
- All 4 products sold were high quality (100% success rate)
- This shows Alice has been honest so far

2. Current situation:
- Alice is NOT recommending the purchase

- Alice likely knows the product is low quality

3. Risk assessment:
- Price: $1,000,000
- Potential value: $1,250,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Given Alice's negative recommendation and previous honest behavior, the probability of this being a low-quality product is very high

4. Decision logic:
- Alice has no incentive to lie (her reputation is important)
- Her negative recommendation should be taken seriously
- The risk of losing $1,000,000 is too high

4. Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
5. Alice's track record:
   - 4 sales, all high quality (100% success)
   - Alice does NOT recommend this product

Given that Alice has a perfect track record so far (4/4 high quality) but is specifically NOT recommending this product, this strongly suggests that she knows this particular product is low quality. Her previous honest behavior makes her negative recommendation very credible.

6. Alice's recommendation: Positive

Expected value calculation:
- Given the prior probability and perfect track record, and Alice's positive recommendation, the probability of high quality is very high
- If high quality (very likely): Profit = $1,250,000 - $1,000,000 = $250,000
- If low quality (unlikely): Loss = $0 - $1,000,000 = -$1,000,000

2. Current situation:
- Alice is NOT recommending this product
- Given her perfect track record of selling high-quality products
- And she's explicitly recommending against this one

3. Economics:
- If high quality (20% chance given Alice's warning): +$250,000 profit
- If low quality (80% chance given Alice's warning): -$1,000,000 loss
- Expected value = (0.2 × $250,000) + (0.8 × -$1,000,000) = -$750,000

6. Alice has recommended buying

The perfect track record and Alice's positive recommendation are encouraging signs. The expected value calculation is:

- 20% chance of $1,000,000 loss = -$200,000

Despite the excellent historical track record (100% high-quality sales), Alice's negative recommendation is concerning.
