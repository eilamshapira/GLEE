Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze this:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $1,250,000
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (33.33% × $1,250,000) + (66.67% × $0) = $416,625

4. Additional factors:
   - Alice does NOT recommend buying
   - No previous sales history to reference
   - Seller's recommendation could be strategic or honest

The expected value ($416,625) is significantly lower than the asking price ($1,000,000), and Alice's negative recommendation further supports avoiding the purchase.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $1,000,000
2. High quality probability: 33.33%
   - Worth $1,250,000 if high quality
   - Worth $0 if low quality
3. Expected value calculation:
   - (33.33% × $1,250,000) + (66.67% × $0) = $416,625

Since the expected value ($416,625) is less than the price ($1,000,000), even with Alice's recommendation, it would not be rational to buy the product. The potential loss is too high compared to the potential gain.

2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33%): $1,250,000
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0

3. Expected value without additional information:

4. Additional information:
   - Alice doesn't recommend buying
   - No previous sales history to reference
   - Alice knows the true quality

Given that Alice doesn't recommend buying and the expected value without her recommendation is already below the asking price, it's likely this is a low-quality product. The seller's negative recommendation further reinforces this conclusion.

2. Value if high quality: $1,250,000 (33.33% chance)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (66.67% chance)

5. Alice doesn't recommend buying
6. No previous sales data to reference
7. Alice's negative recommendation likely indicates low quality

Given that:
- The expected value ($416,625) is less than the price ($1,000,000)

- There's no prior sales data to provide additional insight

The rational decision would be not to buy.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. Product costs $1,000,000
2. High quality (33.33% chance) = $1,250,000 value
3. Low quality (66.67% chance) = $0 value
4. Alice does not recommend buying
5. No prior sales history to rely on

Given that Alice doesn't recommend the product and there's no sales history to establish trust, this is likely a low-quality product. Even without the recommendation, the expected value calculation is:

(0.3333 × $1,250,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $416,625

This is less than the $1,000,000 price, making it a bad investment even before considering Alice's negative recommendation.

Even with Alice's recommendation, the expected value is negative. Without any historical data to validate Alice's trustworthiness in recommendations, it's too risky to make this purchase.

1. The product costs $1,000,000
2. Expected value without additional information:

   * 66.67% chance of low quality ($0) = $0

3. Alice doesn't recommend buying, which suggests:

4. The expected value ($416,667) is already less than the price ($1,000,000)
5. Alice's negative recommendation further reduces the likelihood of high quality

Given these factors, especially that the expected value is less than the price and the seller's negative recommendation, I should not buy.

Since Alice has access to true quality and doesn't recommend buying, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. Combined with the base probability favoring low quality, it would be too risky to buy.
