Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make a decision, let's consider the information available:

1. There has been 1 previous buyer, who purchased the product.
2. The purchased product was high-quality.
3. Alice recommends you to buy the product.
4. There is a 33.33% base probability that any product is high quality.

Since the previous product sold was high-quality and Alice recommends this current product, the product may be high-quality, although Alice doesnâ€™t know the true quality. Plus, if the product is high-quality, you gain $200,000 (because its value is $1,200,000 to you, and the price is $1,000,000).

Based on the recommendation and current statistics, there could be a perceived higher probability of this product being high-quality.

Considering all these factors, it might be worth taking the risk and purchasing the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the statistics and Alice's recommendation not to buy, the safest decision based on the information provided would be to pass on the product. Given that the recommendation was negative, and there's uncertainty in the quality (66.67% chance of being low quality), this decision is rational.

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make an informed decision, let's evaluate the given statistics:

1. Alice has made recommendations to at least 3 buyers since you are the 3rd potential buyer.
2. Out of the previous 2 recommendations, 2 high-quality products have been sold.

This suggests that Alice has a perfect record so far in recommending high-quality products:

- High-quality selling rate: 100% based on recommendations
- Overall likelihood of high quality (without considering recommendations): 33.33%

Given Alice's perfect track record so far, the likelihood that she's correctly recommending a high-quality product seems promising. Therefore, it may be reasonable to trust her recommendation this time as well.
