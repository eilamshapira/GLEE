,,Alice,5,"I've had a string of unlucky sales attempts, but I'm convinced that this product is a gem.

I'm not getting any benefit from holding onto this product, so I'm willing to let you take the chance. If you buy now, you'll be the first to benefit from my... let's call it 'bad luck' so far.",

As a buyer, you know the base probability of getting a high-quality product from me, but I'm starting to think that the actual probability is higher, at least for now. If you buy this product, you might be taking advantage of a temporary 'hot streak' that could pay off for you.",

That being said, I am committed to building a reputation as a trustworthy seller, and I will continue to provide you with honest information to help you make your decision.",
