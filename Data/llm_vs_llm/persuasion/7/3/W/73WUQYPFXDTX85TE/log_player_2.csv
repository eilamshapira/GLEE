"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this decision:

- If Alice knows the quality and is being truthful, her not recommending the product suggests it's low quality
- A high quality product is worth $12,500 to me, which would give me a profit of $2,500 if I bought it
- A low quality product is worth $0 to me, which would give me a loss of $10,000 if I bought it
- Since Alice knows the product quality and has chosen not to recommend it, it's most likely low quality
- If I buy a low quality product, I'll lose $10,000

Given Alice's lack of recommendation and the potential large loss, I should not buy this product.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this decision:

- Alice is recommending this product, which suggests it might be high quality
- If it's high quality (worth $12,500 to me), buying it for $10,000 would give me a $2,500 profit
- If it's low quality (worth $0 to me), buying it would result in a $10,000 loss
- Alice knows the product quality and has recommended it, suggesting it might be in her interest for me to buy
- There's a 33.33% base chance of high quality and 66.67% chance of low quality

Given that Alice recommended this product, it increases the probability that it's high quality. In Round 1, she didn't recommend a product that turned out to be low quality, which suggests some consistency in her recommendations.

I'll trust her recommendation in this case.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this decision:

- Alice is not recommending this product
- In Round 1, Alice didn't recommend a product that was indeed low quality
- In Round 2, Alice recommended a product that was indeed high quality
- So far, Alice's recommendations have been accurate and aligned with my interests
- If I follow her recommendation not to buy, I avoid a potential $10,000 loss on a low-quality product
- The pattern suggests Alice is being truthful in her recommendations

Since Alice has been reliable so far and she's not recommending this product, I should avoid buying it.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this decision:

- In all previous rounds, Alice's recommendations have aligned with the true quality:
  - Round 1: Not recommended → Low quality
  - Round 2: Recommended → High quality
  - Round 3: Not recommended → Low quality
- This consistent pattern suggests Alice is being truthful and helping me avoid bad purchases
- The risk of buying a low-quality product ($10,000 loss) is much higher than the potential profit from a high-quality one ($2,500 gain)

Since Alice has been reliable in her recommendations so far and she's not recommending this product, I should follow her advice.

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
