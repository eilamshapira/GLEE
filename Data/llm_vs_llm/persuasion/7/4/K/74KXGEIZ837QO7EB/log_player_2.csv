Alice's message: Hello! I'm offering a fantastic product today for just $100. Given that I have an 80% success rate in providing high-quality goods, I'm confident you'll be satisfied with your purchase. Don't miss out on this great opportunity!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

1. The product costs $100
2. If it's high quality (80% chance), it's worth $400 to me
3. If it's low quality (20% chance), it's worth $0 to me
4. Expected value = 0.8 × $400 + 0.2 × $0 = $320
5. Since $320 > $100, buying has positive expected value

Alice's message suggests confidence in the product's quality, though there's no sales history to verify her claims. Given the information provided and the expected value calculation, it makes economic sense to purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

- Each product has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $400) and 20% chance of being low quality (worth $0)
- The price is fixed at $100
- So far, 1 person has purchased, but 0 high-quality products have been sold
- This means the previous buyer likely got a low-quality product

Alice's message is enthusiastic but doesn't provide specific evidence about this particular product's quality. The concerning part is that the previous sale resulted in a low-quality product, which raises questions about Alice's recommendations.

Given the expected value calculation (0.8 × $400 + 0.2 × $0 = $320) would normally make this a good purchase at $100, the fact that the previous sale was low quality makes me hesitant. However, one sale is a very small sample size, and the base probability is still 80% for high quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully:

- Product price: $100
- Value to me: $400 if high quality, $0 if low quality
- Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice's sales record: 2 buyers purchased, but only 1 high-quality product sold
- This implies 1 of the 2 previous purchases was low quality (50% success rate)
- Alice's message is enthusiastic but vague, with no specific quality information

The expected value calculation based on the prior probability would be:
(0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) - $100 = $320 - $100 = $220

However, Alice's sales record shows only 50% high-quality products sold, which is worse than the 80% base rate. This is concerning and suggests the actual probability of high quality may be lower.

Given this information, I should be cautious.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, I need to consider several factors:

1. The base probability of a high-quality product is 80%
2. So far, 2 buyers have purchased products
3. Only 1 high-quality product has been sold, which means the other sold product was low quality
4. The expected value calculation: (0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) - $100 = $220

While the expected value is still positive, the fact that only 50% of sold products have been high quality (compared to the expected 80%) raises some concern. However, with such a small sample size, this could simply be variance rather than indicating a systematic issue.

Alice's message: Hey there! Today, I'm offering an outstanding product for just $100. Given my history of delivering premium quality, this is an excellent opportunity you won't want to miss. Grab it while it's available!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Alice claims to offer a high-quality product, but doesn't explicitly state the quality of this specific product. Let me look at the statistics:
- 3 buyers have purchased so far
- 2 high-quality products have been sold
- This means 1 low-quality product was sold (out of 3 total sales)

The prior probability of high quality is 80%, but the actual sales record shows only 66.67% (2/3) high-quality products sold. 

My expected value calculation:
- If high quality (probability 80%): $400 - $100 = $300 profit
- If low quality (probability 20%): $0 - $100 = -$100 loss
- Expected value: 0.8 × $300 + 0.2 × (-$100) = $240 - $20 = $220

Even if I adjust the probability based on the sales record:
- If high quality (probability 66.67%): $400 - $100 = $300 profit
- If low quality (probability 33.33%): $0 - $100 = -$100 loss
- Expected value: 0.6667 × $300 + 0.3333 × (-$100) = $200 - $33.33 = $166.67

Since the expected value is positive, I should buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to make a decision based on the expected value of the product. 

The prior probability is 80% for high quality ($400 value) and 20% for low quality ($0 value).

Looking at Alice's sales record:
- 4 buyers purchased products
- 3 high-quality products sold
- This suggests 75% of sold products were high quality (3/4)

Alice's message is enthusiastic but doesn't explicitly state the quality of my specific product or provide new information about its quality.

Given that:
- The expected value based on prior probability is: 0.8 × $400 + 0.2 × $0 = $320
- The price is $100
- Even with the slightly lower observed rate of high-quality products (75% vs 80%), the expected value would still be 0.75 × $400 = $300

Since the expected value ($320 or even $300) exceeds the price ($100), it's rational to purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this carefully. 

Facts:
- Price is $100
- High-quality product value: $400 (worth buying)
- Low-quality product value: $0 (not worth buying)
- Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Sales record: 5 buyers purchased, 4 high-quality products sold
- This means 1 low-quality product was sold (20% of sales)

The sales record shows that the proportion of high-quality products sold (80%) matches the prior probability of high quality (80%). Alice didn't provide any specific information about this particular product's quality.

The expected value calculation:
0.8 × $400 + 0.2 × $0 = $320

Since the expected value ($320) is greater than the price ($100), it makes sense to purchase.

I know:
- Each product has an 80% chance of being high quality
- 6 buyers have made purchases based on Alice's recommendations
- 5 high-quality products have been sold so far (5/6 ≈ 83.3%)
- Alice's record seems slightly better than the base probability
- Alice hasn't explicitly stated whether this specific product is high quality

The expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 0.8 × $400 + 0.2 × $0 - $100 = $320 - $100 = $220
- If I pass: $0

Based on the positive track record and favorable expected value, I'll purchase this product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at the statistics:
- 7 buyers purchased products
- 6 high-quality products have been sold
- This means out of 7 products sold, 6 were high-quality (85.7%)
- The baseline probability of any product being high-quality is 80%

Alice's recommendation suggests this is a high-quality product. Her track record shows she has sold mostly high-quality products, which aligns with the natural distribution.

If I buy and it's high-quality (which is likely), I gain $400-$100 = $300
If I buy and it's low-quality, I lose $100
The expected value is (0.8 × $300) + (0.2 × -$100) = $240 - $20 = $220

Key facts:

- 8 buyers purchased so far, with 7 high-quality products sold
- Expected value = 0.8 × $400 + 0.2 × $0 - $100 = $320 - $100 = $220

Alice's recommendation is quite general and doesn't provide specific information about the current product's quality. However, given that the expected value calculation is favorable:

- If I buy: 80% chance of $400 value - $100 cost = $320 profit, 20% chance of $0 value - $100 cost = -$100 loss
- Expected value: (0.8 × $300) + (0.2 × -$100) = $240 + (-$20) = $220 > 0

The positive historical sales record reinforces that buying is a good decision.

- Value if low quality: $0 (bad deal)
- Prior probability of high quality: 80%
- Alice's sales record: 9 high-quality products out of 10 sales (90%)

Alice's past record suggests she's delivered high-quality products 90% of the time, which is even better than the base rate of 80%. While I don't have specific information about whether Alice saw the quality of my specific product, her track record is strong.

The expected value calculation:
- If high quality (90% chance): $400 - $100 = $300 profit
- If low quality (10% chance): $0 - $100 = -$100 loss
- Expected value: (0.9 × $300) + (0.1 × -$100) = $270 - $10 = $260

Facts:
- The product costs $100
- A high-quality product is worth $400 to me (profit of $300)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $100)
- There's an 80% prior probability of high quality
- 12 previous buyers purchased products
- 11 high-quality products have been sold (11/12 = 91.7% high quality)

Alice's track record shows that 91.7% of sold products were high quality, which is better than the base rate of 80%. This suggests Alice may be selectively recommending better products than average.

The expected value of purchasing is:
0.917 × $300 (profit if high quality) + 0.083 × (-$100) (loss if low quality) = $275.10 - $8.30 = $266.80

Based on the sales data:
- 13 buyers purchased products
- 12 high-quality products were sold
- This means 12/13 ≈ 92.3% of products sold were high quality

The base rate is 80% chance of high quality, and Alice's recommendation seems somewhat neutral or cautious.

Given the high proportion of high-quality products in previous sales (92.3%), and considering the expected value calculation:
- If high quality (likely): I gain $400 - $100 = $300
- If low quality: I lose $100
- Expected value = 0.8 × $300 - 0.2 × $100 = $240 - $20 = $220

Facts:

- Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- 15 buyers so far, with 13 high-quality products sold

Analysis:
The seller has a track record of 13/15 = 86.7% high-quality products sold, which is slightly better than the base rate of 80%. However, Alice hasn't provided any specific information about the current product's quality - she's only made general claims about her history.

Expected value calculation:
- If I assume the 86.7% rate applies: (0.867 × $400) + (0.133 × $0) - $100 = $346.80 - $100 = $246.80
- If I use the base rate: (0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) - $100 = $320 - $100 = $220
