"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential values:
   - High quality (80% chance): $30,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $30,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $24,000

Since the expected value ($24,000) is greater than the price ($10,000), and Alice has recommended to buy, it's rational to purchase.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the previous round was successful and Alice's recommendation was honest, combined with the favorable base probabilities:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential values:
   - High quality (80% chance): $30,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value calculation remains:
(0.8 × $30,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $24,000

The expected value ($24,000) still significantly exceeds the price ($10,000), and Alice's previous recommendation proved trustworthy. It makes sense to continue trusting her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has been truthful in her recommendations so far, with two successful high-quality purchases. The fundamentals remain favorable:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential values:
   - High quality (80% chance): $30,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value is still:
(0.8 × $30,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $24,000

The expected value ($24,000) continues to exceed the price ($10,000) by a significant margin, and Alice's track record of recommendations has been perfect so far. It's rational to continue following her recommendations.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to demonstrate reliability with three accurate recommendations resulting in high-quality products. The mathematical fundamentals remain unchanged:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential values:
   - High quality (80% chance): $30,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value:
(0.8 × $30,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $24,000

With the expected value ($24,000) still well above the price ($10,000), and Alice's perfect track record of recommendations, there's no reason to deviate from the buying strategy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Interesting development. We just experienced our first low-quality product after Alice's recommendation. However, let's analyze:

1. This matches the expected probability distribution (we were bound to get some low-quality products given the 20% chance)
2. Base probabilities haven't changed:
   - High quality (80% chance): $30,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value is still:
(0.8 × $30,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $24,000

Even though we just had a loss, the mathematical expectation ($24,000) remains above the price ($10,000). One bad outcome doesn't change the underlying probabilities, and it's still rational to continue buying.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendations have led to 4 high-quality and 1 low-quality product so far, which is actually close to the expected 80/20 distribution. The fundamentals remain:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential values:
   - High quality (80% chance): $30,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value:
(0.8 × $30,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $24,000

The expected value ($24,000) continues to exceed the price ($10,000) by a significant margin. The last round returned to a high-quality product, confirming that the previous low-quality product was likely just part of the normal probability distribution. It remains rational to continue buying.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","We've now seen 4 high-quality and 2 low-quality products, which is still reasonably close to the expected 80/20 distribution. Let's analyze:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential values:
   - High quality (80% chance): $30,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value remains:
(0.8 × $30,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $24,000

Despite just experiencing another loss, the mathematical expectation ($24,000) is still well above the price ($10,000). The outcomes we're seeing are within normal probability variations, and the fundamental economic logic for buying hasn't changed. It's rational to continue with the strategy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"

The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","So far we've seen 5 high-quality and 2 low-quality products, which aligns well with the expected 80/20 distribution. The fundamentals remain consistent:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential values:
   - High quality (80% chance): $30,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value:
(0.8 × $30,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $24,000

The expected value ($24,000) still significantly exceeds the price ($10,000), and our actual experience continues to track with the theoretical probabilities. The last round returned to a high-quality product, reinforcing the validity of our strategy. It remains rational to continue buying.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","We've now seen 5 high-quality and 3 low-quality products. This is slightly worse than the expected 80/20 ratio, but let's analyze:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential values:
   - High quality (80% chance): $30,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value remains:
