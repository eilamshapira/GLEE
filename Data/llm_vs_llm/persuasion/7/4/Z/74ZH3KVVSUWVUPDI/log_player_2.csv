So far, you have earned $125 - $100 for each of the 4 products you bought, totaling $200 - $400 = -$200 plus $125 for each of the 4 high-quality products equals $500 - $400 = $100. Additionally, you avoided losing $100 for each of the 5 low-quality products you didn't buy, saving you $500. So, your current score is $600."
