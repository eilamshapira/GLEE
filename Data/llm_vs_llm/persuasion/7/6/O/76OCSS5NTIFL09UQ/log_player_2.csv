"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential values:
   - High quality (80% chance): $3,000,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $3,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $2,400,000

Since the expected value ($2,400,000) is greater than the price ($1,000,000), and Alice is recommending the purchase, it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given Alice's recommendation was honest in the first round and the fundamental probabilities remain the same:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential values:
   - High quality (80% chance): $3,000,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $3,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $2,400,000

The expected value ($2,400,000) still exceeds the price ($1,000,000), and Alice has shown to be truthful in her previous recommendation. It makes sense to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has been honest with her recommendations for two rounds now, and the mathematical expectation remains favorable:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential values:
   - High quality (80% chance): $3,000,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $3,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $2,400,000

The expected value ($2,400,000) is still well above the price ($1,000,000), and Alice's track record of recommendations has been reliable. It's rational to continue buying.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has consistently given honest recommendations for three rounds, and all products have been high-quality. The fundamental probabilities still make this a good investment:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential values:
   - High quality (80% chance): $3,000,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $3,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $2,400,000

The expected value ($2,400,000) remains significantly higher than the price ($1,000,000), and Alice's recommendations have proven reliable. Continuing to buy is the rational choice.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has given truthful recommendations for four consecutive rounds, with all products being high-quality. The mathematical expectation remains favorable:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential values:
   - High quality (80% chance): $3,000,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $3,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $2,400,000

The expected value ($2,400,000) still significantly exceeds the price ($1,000,000), and Alice's perfect track record of recommendations adds additional confidence. It's rational to continue buying.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has maintained a perfect track record with five honest recommendations, all resulting in high-quality products. The fundamental economics remain attractive:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential values:
   - High quality (80% chance): $3,000,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $3,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $2,400,000

The expected value ($2,400,000) continues to be well above the price ($1,000,000), and Alice's consistent honesty further supports the decision to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has now shown perfect reliability with six consecutive honest recommendations, all being high-quality products. The economics continue to be favorable:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential values:
   - High quality (80% chance): $3,000,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $3,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $2,400,000

The expected value ($2,400,000) remains significantly higher than the price ($1,000,000). While we should stay alert for any changes in pattern, Alice's perfect track record gives additional confidence to continue buying.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has maintained a flawless record with seven consecutive honest recommendations, all yielding high-quality products. The economic fundamentals remain attractive:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential values:
   - High quality (80% chance): $3,000,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $3,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $2,400,000

The expected value ($2,400,000) is still more than double the price ($1,000,000). While this streak of high-quality products is above the expected 80% probability, the base economics and Alice's consistent honesty support continuing to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has maintained perfect honesty with eight consecutive high-quality recommendations. While this streak is running above the base 80% probability, the fundamental economics remain favorable:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential values:
   - High quality (80% chance): $3,000,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $3,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $2,400,000

The expected value ($2,400,000) continues to be well above the price ($1,000,000). Even though we should be prepared for eventual low-quality products (given the 20% probability), Alice's consistent truthfulness and the positive expected value make buying the rational choice.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 10
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is an interesting change - for the first time, Alice is not recommending the purchase. This is significant because:

1. Alice has been perfectly honest for 9 rounds
2. She knows the true quality of the product
3. She has now explicitly recommended against buying

Given Alice's proven track record of honesty and her direct knowledge of the product quality, this strong signal suggests this is likely a low-quality product. While the base probabilities would normally suggest buying (80% chance of high quality), Alice's specific knowledge and demonstrated trustworthiness outweigh the general probability.

Since Alice has no incentive to lie (she gets the same $1,000,000 either way if I buy) and has been consistently honest, I should trust her negative recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has now proven to be completely honest for 10 consecutive rounds, including warning me away from a low-quality product in the previous round when she could have stayed silent or recommended it anyway. This further reinforces her trustworthiness.

The basic economics remain favorable:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential values:
   - High quality (80% chance): $3,000,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $3,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $2,400,000

Given that Alice is now recommending this product, and she has demonstrated she will warn us about low-quality products, we can be confident this is a high-quality product. The expected value combined with Alice's proven honest recommendations makes this a good purchase.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 12
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Once again, Alice is explicitly recommending against buying the product. Given her track record:

1. She has been honest in all 11 previous rounds
2. She correctly warned about a low-quality product in round 10
3. She followed that with an honest recommendation for a high-quality product in round 11
4. She gains nothing by lying (she gets $1,000,000 either way if I buy)

While the base probability is 80% for high-quality products, Alice's direct knowledge of the product quality and her demonstrated trustworthiness in warnings makes her recommendation more valuable than the general probability.

Given her perfect track record and explicit warning, this is very likely a low-quality product that would be worth $0.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 13
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice is giving another negative recommendation, and her track record continues to be perfect:

1. She has been honest in all 12 previous rounds
2. She has accurately warned about low-quality products twice now
3. She continues to have no incentive to lie (she would get $1,000,000 either way if I buy)

While the base probability for any random product is 80% high-quality, Alice's specific knowledge of this product's quality and her demonstrated truthfulness in recommendations (both positive and negative) make her warning more valuable than the general probability.

Given her consistent honesty and explicit warning, this is very likely another low-quality product that would be worth $0.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 14
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice is giving her fourth negative recommendation, and her track record remains perfect after 13 rounds:

1. She has accurately identified all products so far
2. She has consistently warned about low-quality products (three times now, all correct)
3. She maintains no incentive to lie as she would get $1,000,000 either way if I buy

While the base probability of a high-quality product is 80%, Alice's perfect track record of honest recommendations and her specific knowledge of this product's quality outweigh the general probability.

Given her consistent truthfulness and another explicit warning, this is very likely another low-quality product that would be worth $0. Following her recommendation is the rational choice.

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 15

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential values:
   - High quality (80% chance): $3,000,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!

Round 16
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to demonstrate perfect honesty through 15 rounds, accurately identifying both high-quality and low-quality products. Her track record includes:

2. She has proven reliable in both positive recommendations and warnings
3. She just correctly recommended two high-quality products
4. She still has no incentive to lie (would get $1,000,000 either way if I buy)

While the base probability for any random product is 80% high-quality, Alice's perfect track record of honesty and her specific knowledge of this product's quality make her warning more valuable than the general probability.

Given her consistent truthfulness throughout the game and this explicit warning, this is very likely a low-quality product that would be worth $0. The rational choice is to trust her warning.

Round 18
Alice recommends you to buy the product.
