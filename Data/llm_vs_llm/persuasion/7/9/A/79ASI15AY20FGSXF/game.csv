Is it the price? The product itself? Or is there something else at play?",

I've done my best to provide excellent products and be transparent about their quality, but it seems that's not enough. I'm going to continue offering products to you, but I want to be upfront that my expectations are low. If you're interested in buying, I'm happy to facilitate the sale. If not, I'll just keep moving forward. No pressure, no hard sell. Just a simple offer.",
