Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to decide whether to buy the product based on the information provided.

Here's my analysis:
- The product costs $10,000
- If it's high quality (80% chance), it's worth $12,000 to me (profit of $2,000)
- If it's low quality (20% chance), it's worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- Alice has recommended that I buy the product
- There is no track record yet to assess Alice's recommendation reliability

Expected value calculation:
0.8 × $12,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $9,600

Since the expected value ($9,600) is less than the price ($10,000), and I don't have historical data on Alice's recommendations, the rational choice is not to buy.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision:

- Product price: $10,000
- High-quality probability: 80% (worth $12,000 to me)
- Low-quality probability: 20% (worth $0 to me)
- Expected value: (0.8 × $12,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $9,600

Since the expected value ($9,600) is less than the price ($10,000), it would be a negative expected value purchase if I had no additional information.

However, Alice has recommended I buy the product. If Alice is being truthful, this could indicate the product is high quality. But I need to be cautious since Alice benefits from selling regardless of quality.

Without any previous sales history to establish Alice's trustworthiness or pattern of recommendations, I'll rely on the basic probability analysis.

The product costs $10,000.
- If it's high quality (80% chance), it's worth $12,000 to me (profit of $2,000)
- If it's low quality (20% chance), it's worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)

Expected value calculation:
0.8 × $2,000 + 0.2 × (-$10,000) = $1,600 - $2,000 = -$400

Even though Alice recommends buying the product, the expected value is negative. Without additional information about Alice's recommendation reliability, I should decline.

- The product has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $12,000) and 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)
- Expected value: (0.8 × $12,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $9,600
- Price: $10,000
- Alice recommends buying the product, but since this is the first sale, I have no past data to judge her credibility

The expected value ($9,600) is less than the asking price ($10,000), which means on average I would lose $400 per purchase.

Even though Alice recommends buying, the recommendation alone doesn't change the fundamental economics of this decision.

- A high-quality product is worth $12,000 to me (profit of $2,000)

The expected value calculation:

Expected value calculation:

- Alice has had 1 buyer before me, who purchased a product
- 0 high-quality products have been sold so far (meaning the previous buyer got a low-quality product)
- Alice recommends that I buy the product

This situation is concerning. Alice recommended the previous buyer to purchase what turned out to be a low-quality product. Now she's recommending I buy this product as well.

The expected value of a random product is: (0.8 × $12,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $9,600
This is already below the $10,000 asking price.

Given that Alice has already sold one low-quality product with a recommendation to buy, I don't find her recommendation credible.
