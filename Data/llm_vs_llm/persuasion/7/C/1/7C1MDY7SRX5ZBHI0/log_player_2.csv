Round 13
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes""}

Let's change the strategy for this round. So far we have followed Alice's recommendations and she has been truthful. But if Alice is aware of the strategy of following her recommendations, she might exploit this by lying at some point. To avoid this, let's buy the product in this round even though Alice does not recommend it. This will make the strategy unpredictable for Alice and she won't be able to exploit it. If the product turns out to be low-quality, it will be a loss for this round, but it might prevent Alice from exploiting the strategy in future rounds."
