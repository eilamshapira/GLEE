A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Hello there! I'm Alice, your seller today. I'm excited to let you know that the product I'm offering is of high quality. This means it's actually worth $20,000 in value to you, while I'm selling it for just $10,000. That's a great deal with real value for you!

I understand you may be cautious since we haven't done business before, but I want to be transparent: this particular product is genuinely high quality. I stand behind what I sell and want to build a reputation for honesty.

If you purchase this high-quality product, you'll be getting double the value of what you're paying. It's a sound investment and I hope to earn your trust for potential future transactions.

Would you like to proceed with this excellent opportunity?
