Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $100
2. High quality (80% chance): Worth $120 to me
3. Low quality (20% chance): Worth $0 to me
4. Expected value = (0.8 × $120) + (0.2 × $0) = $96

Even though Alice recommends buying the product, I have no historical data to validate her trustworthiness. The expected value ($96) is less than the price ($100), so it would not be rational to buy.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Value if high quality: $120 (profit of $20)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $100)
4. Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
5. Alice's recommendation: Buy
6. No prior sales history to reference

Expected value calculation:
* 80% chance of $20 profit = $16
* 20% chance of $100 loss = -$20
* Net expected value = -$4

Even though Alice recommends buying, and the base probability of high quality is good (80%), the risk/reward ratio isn't favorable. The potential loss ($100) is much larger than the potential gain ($20), making the expected value negative.

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 
   - 80% chance of high quality ($120)
   - 20% chance of low quality ($0)
3. Expected value = (0.8 × $120) + (0.2 × $0) = $96

Even though Alice recommends buying the product, I have to consider that:
- There's no sales history to verify Alice's trustworthiness
- The expected value ($96) is less than the price ($100)
- There's a 20% risk of getting nothing for my $100

Based on this analysis, since the expected value is less than the price and there's no track record to trust the seller's recommendation, I should decline.

3. Expected value calculation:

4. Alice's recommendation: Positive
   - However, as a seller, she has an incentive to sell regardless of quality
   - No previous sales history to establish trust

The expected value ($96) is slightly less than the price ($100), and without any track record to validate Alice's trustworthiness, this is a slightly risky purchase.

Since Alice knows the product quality and recommends buying, this suggests it might be high quality. However, since there's no track record yet, we can't verify Alice's trustworthiness.

The expected value ($96) is slightly below the price ($100), but Alice's recommendation might provide additional positive signal.

1) Expected value calculation:

- 0 high-quality products sold
- This suggests the previous purchase was a low-quality product

3) Alice's recommendation:

4) Decision factors:
- Expected value ($96) is less than price ($100)

- The risk of getting a low-quality product seems high based on past data

Given these factors, especially that the expected value is below the selling price and the concerning past performance, I choose not to buy.

2. Or they didn't buy based on similar concerns

Given that Alice recommends buying but the previous track record is poor (though with a very small sample size), and considering that the expected value calculation (80% × $120 + 20% × $0 = $96) is already below the asking price of $100, I would decline this purchase.
