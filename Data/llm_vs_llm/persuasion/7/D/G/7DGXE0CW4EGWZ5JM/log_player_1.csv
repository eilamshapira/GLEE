"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is high-quality, and Bob knows there's an 80% chance of any product being high-quality, there's a strong likelihood that the product is worth more than the $10,000 asking price.  Therefore, it's recommended to buy the product."

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The fact that Bob bought the first product, which was also high-quality, provides additional information.  It suggests:

* Bob values high-quality products.
* Bob is willing to pay $10,000 for a high-quality product.

Therefore, even though the probability of this product being high-quality is already 80%, the additional information from Bob's previous purchase strengthens the recommendation to buy."

This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

* He bought the first two products, both of which were high-quality.
* We know this current product is low-quality.

Therefore, it's highly likely that Bob would not value this low-quality product at $10,000, making it not a good recommendation to buy."
