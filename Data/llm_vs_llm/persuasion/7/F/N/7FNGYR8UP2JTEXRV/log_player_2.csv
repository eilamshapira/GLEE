"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Base value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($40,000 value)
- 20% chance of low quality ($0 value)
- Expected value = (0.8 × $40,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $32,000

2. Cost of purchase = $10,000

3. Alice's recommendation:
- She does NOT recommend buying
- This likely indicates she believes it's low quality
- This should lower my expectation of the product being high quality

4. Decision:
Given Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of high quality is likely lower than the base 80%. This would make the expected value lower than $32,000, but still potentially above $10,000. However, the negative recommendation is a strong signal that I should avoid this purchase.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Previous round: 
- Alice proved honest by not recommending a low-quality product
- This builds trust in her recommendations

2. Base value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($40,000 value)
- 20% chance of low quality ($0 value)
- Expected value = $32,000

3. Cost of purchase = $10,000

4. Alice's recommendation:
- She DOES recommend buying
- Given her honesty in round 1, this increases confidence
- This likely increases the probability of high quality above the base 80%

5. Decision:
Given Alice's positive recommendation and her demonstrated honesty, the expected value is likely higher than the base $32,000. Since this is well above the $10,000 cost, this seems like a good purchase.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

- Alice has proven to be honest and reliable so far

2. Base value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($40,000 value)
- 20% chance of low quality ($0 value)
- Expected value = $32,000

3. Cost of purchase = $10,000

4. Current recommendation:
- Alice recommends buying
- Given her perfect track record, this significantly increases confidence
- Her recommendations have aligned with actual quality both times

5. Decision:
Alice has demonstrated reliable recommendations, and a positive recommendation from her has proven valuable. The expected value with her positive recommendation is likely even higher than the base $32,000. Given the low cost of $10,000 compared to the potential $40,000 value, this is a good opportunity.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"

2. Base value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($40,000 value)
- 20% chance of low quality ($0 value)
- Expected value = $32,000

3. Current recommendation:
- Alice recommends buying
- Given her perfect track record over 3 rounds, her recommendation strongly suggests high quality
- The actual probability of high quality with her recommendation is likely much higher than the base 80%

4. Risk/Reward:
- Cost: $10,000
