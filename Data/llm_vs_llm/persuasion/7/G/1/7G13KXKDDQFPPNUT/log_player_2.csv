Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though there is a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($3,000,000) significantly outweighs the risk of a low-quality product ($0). 

Alice recommending the product adds a slight bias in favor of the product being high-quality, as she knows the true value. However, since no prior data is available, this bias is minimal.

Therefore, given the high potential reward and the lack of information suggesting otherwise, it's in the buyer's best interest to buy the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which means she knows this product is high quality.  
* **The statistics:** The previous buyer also bought the product, and it was high quality. This strengthens the likelihood of this product also being high quality.

While there's still a 20% chance of it being low quality, the potential reward ($3,000,000) far outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000."

~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, who knows the product's true quality, is not recommending the product. This is a strong signal that it's likely low quality.
* **Previous sales:**  While the previous sales data is positive (2/2 high-quality products sold), this is a small sample size and doesn't negate Alice's recommendation. 

The risk of buying a low-quality product at $1,000,000 is too high, especially given Alice's negative recommendation."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice knows the true quality of the product and is recommending you buy it. This strongly suggests the product is high quality.
* **Sales record:**  All three previous buyers who purchased the product received a high-quality item. This further supports the likelihood of the current product being high quality.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** All previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation purchased high-quality products. This indicates a strong pattern and suggests that Alice is likely providing accurate recommendations.
* **No Loss Potential:**  Even if the product turns out to be low-quality, the price is $1,000,000, which is less than the value of a high-quality product ($3,000,000). This means the worst-case scenario is no profit, but no loss either.
* **Potential for High Gain:**  If the product is high-quality, the potential profit is $2,000,000. This is a significant gain.

Based on the available information, the odds are heavily in favor of the product being high-quality, making it a worthwhile purchase."
