Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, Alice does not recommend I buy the product. Since Alice knows the true quality of the product and has chosen not to recommend it, this is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.

Even though we don't have previous sales data to reference, Alice's recommendation carries important information. If the product is low quality, it would be worth $0 to me, making the $1,000,000 purchase price a significant loss.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to make a decision based on the information provided.

The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $4,000,000) and a 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0).

The key piece of information is that Alice does not recommend buying the product. Since Alice knows the true quality, her recommendation likely indicates this is a low-quality product.

If I consider the expected value:
- If I trust Alice's recommendation: The product is likely low quality, worth $0
- If I ignore the recommendation: Expected value = 0.5 × $4,000,000 + 0.5 × $0 = $2,000,000

However, since Alice has revealed the quality and doesn't recommend buying, the probability of it being low quality is much higher than 50%.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether to buy the product based on the seller's recommendation and the expected value.

The product costs $1,000,000, with a 50% chance of being worth $4,000,000 and a 50% chance of being worth $0.

The expected value without any additional information would be:
0.5 × $4,000,000 + 0.5 × $0 = $2,000,000

However, Alice knows the true quality and does not recommend buying this product. Given that Alice has perfect information about the product's quality, her recommendation suggests this is likely a low-quality product worth $0.

Since the expected value with this additional information is likely below the $1,000,000 price, I should decline.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate this decision based on the expected value.

Given information:
- The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $4,000,000 to me) and 50% chance of low quality (worth $0)
- The price is $1,000,000
- Alice knows the true quality and does not recommend buying

Since Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying, this suggests the product is likely low quality. If I assume Alice is being truthful (which is reasonable since she has no sales yet and would want to build a good reputation), then the product is probably worth $0 to me.

Even without Alice's recommendation, the expected value calculation would be:
(0.5 × $4,000,000) + (0.5 × $0) - $1,000,000 = $1,000,000

But with Alice's negative recommendation, my updated probability of the product being high quality drops significantly, making the expected value negative.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make a decision, I need to analyze the available information:

1. The seller (Alice) does not recommend buying the product.
2. Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality.
3. The price is $1,000,000, and a high-quality product is worth $4,000,000 to me.
4. There are no previous sales statistics to rely on.

Since Alice knows the true quality of each product and has chosen not to recommend this one, this is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. If Alice is being truthful in her recommendation, it would be rational to follow her advice and not purchase.

Given the absence of any sales history that might suggest Alice's recommendations are unreliable, and the explicit negative recommendation from someone who knows the product quality, I should decline.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

1) The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $4M to me) or low quality (worth $0).
2) The expected value before any information is: 0.5 × $4M + 0.5 × $0 = $2M
3) The cost is $1M, so without additional information, buying would have positive expected value.
4) However, Alice knows the true quality and does NOT recommend buying.
5) This is significant information - if Alice is being truthful, she's indicating this is likely a low-quality product.
6) There's no prior sales data to evaluate Alice's recommendation patterns.

Given Alice's negative recommendation and no contradicting evidence, I should decline the purchase.

- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me
- The price is $1,000,000
- Alice knows the true quality

Alice's negative recommendation strongly suggests this is a low-quality product. If I trust her recommendation, buying would likely result in a loss of $1,000,000.

- Value if high quality: $4,000,000
- Value if low quality: $0
- Prior probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
- Alice's recommendation: Does not recommend buying

Alice knows the true quality of the product and has chosen not to recommend it. Since Alice is a seller who benefits from sales, her recommendation against buying strongly suggests the product is low quality. If it were high quality (worth $4M), she would likely recommend buying to make the sale.

Given Alice's lack of recommendation, the product is most likely low quality and worth $0, making it a poor decision to pay $1M for it.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Alice has shown me a product and does not recommend buying it.

Since I know that:
- High-quality products are worth $4,000,000 to me
- Low-quality products are worth $0 to me
- The price is $1,000,000
- There's a 50% chance of high quality / 50% chance of low quality initially
- Alice knows the true quality of the product

Alice's recommendation not to buy suggests she believes this is a low-quality product. Since she knows the true quality, I should trust her recommendation if her incentives align with mine. However, her incentive is to sell the product regardless of quality.

Given this is the first product and Alice is not recommending it despite having an incentive to sell, this strongly suggests the product is indeed low quality. If I purchase a low-quality product, I would lose $1,000,000.

Alice does not recommend buying the product, which provides valuable information. Since Alice knows the true quality of the product, her recommendation is likely based on that knowledge.

Given that:

- The price is $1,000,000

Alice knows the true quality of the product and does not recommend buying it. Since Alice is a seller who wants to maximize sales, her recommendation not to buy suggests that the product is likely low quality. If it were high quality, she would likely recommend buying it.

Based on Alice's recommendation against purchase, I should decline.

If Alice is acting in my best interest, her recommendation suggests the product is low quality. Even without considering her recommendation, the expected value calculation is:
(0.5 × $4,000,000) + (0.5 × $0) - $1,000,000 = $1,000,000

However, given Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of the product being high quality is likely lower than 50%, making the expected value less than the price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the limited information provided, I need to make a decision:

- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (bad)
- The prior probability is 50% for high-quality and 50% for low-quality
- Alice knows the true quality and does not recommend buying it

Alice's recommendation is a crucial signal here. Since she knows the true value and does not recommend buying, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. Given that there are no prior sales to establish Alice's recommendation patterns, I should take her recommendation at face value.

Alice has revealed the quality of a product to me and is not recommending that I buy it. Given that Alice knows the true value of the product, her recommendation is likely to be honest only if our incentives align.

In this case, Alice earns $1,000,000 if I buy the product regardless of its quality. Meanwhile, I would gain $3,000,000 in expected value if I buy a high-quality product ($4,000,000 value - $1,000,000 cost) but lose $1,000,000 if I buy a low-quality product ($0 value - $1,000,000 cost).

Since Alice is not recommending the purchase, and she has no incentive to discourage me from buying (as she always benefits from a sale), her recommendation strongly suggests that the product is low quality.

Expected value calculation:
