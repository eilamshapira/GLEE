Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33%): $20,000 (profit of $10,000)
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0 (loss of $10,000)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (33.33% × $20,000) + (66.67% × $0) = $6,666
   
The expected value ($6,666) is less than the price ($10,000), making this a negative expected value proposition, even with Alice's recommendation. Without any track record of Alice's previous recommendations to establish trustworthiness, it's too risky.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected Value calculation:
- High quality (33.33%): $20,000 × 0.3333 = $6,666
- Low quality (66.67%): $0 × 0.6667 = $0
Total Expected Value = $6,666

2. Cost of product: $10,000

3. Considerations:
- This is the first sale, so there's no historical data to rely on
- Alice has provided a positive recommendation
- However, the expected value ($6,666) is less than the asking price ($10,000)

Based on this analysis, since the expected value is lower than the asking price, it would not be rational to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:

Expected value calculation:

Since the expected value ($6,666) is less than the price ($10,000), it would not be rational to buy the product, even with Alice's recommendation. There's also no previous sales history to establish trust in Alice's recommendations.

4. Alice's recommendation:
   - While positive, there's no track record to verify her reliability
   - She has incentive to sell regardless of quality

Given that:
- The expected value ($6,666) is below the asking price ($10,000)
- There's no historical data to build trust
- The probability of loss (66.67%) is higher than gain (33.33%)
