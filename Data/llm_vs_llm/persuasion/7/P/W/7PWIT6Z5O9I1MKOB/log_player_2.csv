Alice recommends you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since there's no historical data, the only information we have is Alice's recommendation. Although we know there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, Alice knows the quality of the product and is recommending it. This suggests a higher probability of the product being high quality.  Therefore, it's worth taking the risk and buying the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, suggesting she believes the product is high quality.
* **Limited Data:**  There is very little data to go on, but the existing data is positive (one high-quality product sold).
* **Potential Gain:** The potential gain from a high-quality product ($400) outweighs the risk of a low-quality product ($0). 

While the chance of a low-quality product is still 20%, the information available makes buying a more reasonable gamble."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which suggests the product is likely high quality. 
* **Previous Sales:**  The sales history shows a high percentage of high-quality products sold (1/2 = 50%). This strengthens the belief that the current product is also high quality.
* **Potential Payoff:** Even with the 20% risk of a low-quality product, the potential payoff of $400 for a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of $100.

**Overall:** The combination of Alice's recommendation and the positive sales history makes it a worthwhile gamble to buy the product."

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, which means she knows it's high quality.  While we don't know her exact knowledge, she has a strong incentive to sell high-quality products to maintain a good reputation and encourage future buyers.
* **Previous Sales Data:**  The sale record indicates a high percentage of high-quality products sold (2/3). This further reinforces the likelihood that the current product is also high quality.
* **Value Proposition:** A high-quality product is worth $400 to you, while the price is only $100. This represents a significant potential profit.

Even though there's a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward outweighs the risk, especially given the positive signals from Alice's recommendation and the sales record."
