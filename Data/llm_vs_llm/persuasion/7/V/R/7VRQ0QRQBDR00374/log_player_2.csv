"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. Base probability of high quality: 80%
2. Expected value without any recommendation:
   * 80% chance of $3M = $2.4M
   * 20% chance of $0 = $0
   * Total expected value = $2.4M
   * Cost = $1M
   * Net expected value = $1.4M

However, Alice has given a negative recommendation. Given that Alice knows the true value and is choosing to not recommend it, this significantly increases the probability that this is a low-quality product.

In fact, Alice has no incentive to discourage me from buying a high-quality product since she would make the sale regardless. Therefore, her negative recommendation is likely honest.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice was honest in Round 1, warning me about a low-quality product.
2. Now she's recommending I buy this product.
3. Alice's incentives:
   * She wants to sell products for $1M each
   * She gains nothing by recommending bad products (as it would hurt her credibility)
   * She seems to be establishing a pattern of honest recommendations

Given that:
* Alice is showing signs of honest signaling
* She's actively recommending this product
* A high-quality product would give me $3M value for $1M cost
* The base probability is 80% high quality
* Plus Alice's positive recommendation increases this probability further

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze:

1. Alice's track record so far:
   * Round 1: Advised not to buy → was low quality (honest)
   * Round 2: Advised to buy → was high quality (honest)
   * She's been completely honest in her recommendations

2. Current situation:
   * Alice is advising not to buy
   * She's proven trustworthy so far
   * She has no incentive to lie about a high-quality product
   * Her negative recommendation strongly suggests this is a low-quality product

Given that:
* Alice has established a pattern of honest recommendations
* She's specifically warning against this purchase
* Her interests align with selling good products (to maintain credibility)
* Previous negative recommendation was accurate

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze:

1. Alice's track record is now perfect through 3 rounds:
   * Round 1: Don't buy → low quality (correct)
   * Round 2: Buy → high quality (correct)
   * Round 3: Don't buy → low quality (correct)

2. Current situation:
   * Alice is recommending to buy
   * She has maintained perfect honesty so far
   * Her incentives align with maintaining this trust
   * When she's recommended buying before (Round 2), it was indeed high quality

3. Economics:
   * Cost is $1M
   * If high quality (which seems very likely given Alice's recommendation), value is $3M
   * Net profit would be $2M if high quality

Given Alice's perfect track record and aligned incentives, plus her positive recommendation:

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.
