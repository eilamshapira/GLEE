,,Alice,1,Hello Bob! I have a great product available for $100. I can assure you that this is a high-quality item that will provide excellent value. I stand behind the quality of this product and am confident you'll find it worth the investment. Would you like to make the purchase?,
,,Bob,1,,no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Hi Bob! I notice you were hesitant last time. I understand you need to be cautious, but today I'm again offering a genuinely high-quality product. As you know, 80% of our products are high-quality and worth $125 to you. I'm being completely transparent - this is one of those valuable items. The $100 price means you'll get great value. Would you like to purchase it?",
,,Bob,2,,no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Hello Bob! Once again, I have a high-quality product available. I want to build a long-term business relationship based on trust. I know you're aware that 80% of our products are high-quality, and I'm being honest with you - this is definitely one of those superior products. At $100, you're getting a product worth $125 to you. Would you like to make the purchase today?",
,,Bob,3,,no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Hi Bob. I can see you're very cautious, which is understandable. Let me be direct: Like the previous times, I have a high-quality product here. I gain nothing by deceiving you since you'll see the quality at the end of each round anyway. My reputation is important to me, and I want to establish trust. This product, like the ones before, is genuinely high-quality and worth more than the $100 asking price. Would you like to purchase it?",
,,Bob,4,,no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Bob, I understand your hesitation after declining four high-quality products. Here's the reality: since you see the quality after each round, you know I've been truthful every time. I've never misrepresented a product. This one is again high-quality. You're statistically losing money by not buying, since these high-quality items are worth $125 to you. I hope you'll consider purchasing this time - I have no incentive to deceive you.",
,,Bob,5,,yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Thank you for trusting me with your last purchase, Bob! As you saw, I was completely honest about the high quality. I'm maintaining that same honesty - today's product is also high-quality. You made a good $25 profit last time, and you can do the same again today. Since you can verify the quality after each round, you know my track record of truthfulness. Would you like to purchase this high-quality product?",
,,Bob,6,,yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Hello Bob! I'm pleased that we're building trust. Just like the last two successful transactions, I have another high-quality product for you today.

Ready to make another $25 profit?",
,,Bob,7,,yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Hi Bob! Our successful business relationship continues - I have another high-quality product today.

Let's maintain this mutually beneficial relationship - would you like to make another $25 profit today?",
,,Bob,8,,yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Hello Bob! Our trading relationship is going great - you've verified that I've been honest every time about product quality. Once again, I have a high-quality product for you.

Shall we continue our profitable partnership?",
,,Bob,9,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Hi Bob, I want to maintain our honest business relationship. Today's product is not of the same quality as our previous transactions.

Let's wait for the next high-quality product to continue our successful trading partnership.",
,,Bob,10,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"Hello Bob. As in our last interaction, I must be transparent with you - today's product is not of the high quality you've come to expect from our successful transactions. I value our business relationship and your trust too much to recommend this purchase. Let's skip this one and continue our profitable partnership when I have another high-quality product to offer.",
,,Bob,11,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"Hi Bob. I appreciate the trust we've built through our honest dealings. Continuing with that transparency, I must inform you that today's product is not of the high quality that has made our previous transactions successful.

,,Bob,12,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"Hello Bob. Once again, I must be straightforward - today's product doesn't meet the high-quality standards of our successful past transactions. I value our trusted business relationship more than making a quick sale. Let's wait for another high-quality product where you can make your usual $25 profit. I appreciate your continued trust in my honest assessments.",
,,Bob,13,,no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,

Ready to resume our successful trading?",

high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"Hi Bob! Just like yesterday, I have another high-quality product for you. You've seen that I consistently tell the truth about product quality - advising against purchases when quality is low and recommending excellent products like this one.

,,Bob,15,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"Hello Bob. After our recent successful transactions, I must be honest - today's product is not of the high quality you've come to expect. As you've seen, I always tell you the truth about quality, whether good or bad. I cannot recommend this purchase, as it wouldn't provide you with value. Let's wait for another high-quality product to continue our profitable trading relationship.",
,,Bob,16,,no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"Excellent news, Bob! After declining yesterday's low-quality product (which confirmed my honesty once again), I now have another high-quality product for you.

,,Bob,17,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"Hello Bob. For our final round, I must maintain the honest approach that has served us both well. Today's product is not of the high quality you've come to expect. I've always been truthful about product quality throughout our 20 rounds, and I won't change that now. Let's end our trading relationship on the positive note of our previous successful transaction rather than with a low-quality purchase. Thank you for your trust throughout our dealings.",
