Round 2

As you know, 80% of our products are high-quality and worth $125 to you. I'm being completely transparent - this is one of those valuable items. The $100 price means you'll get great value.

Round 4
Alice's message: Hi Bob. I can see you're very cautious, which is understandable. Let me be direct: Like the previous times, I have a high-quality product here. I gain nothing by deceiving you since you'll see the quality at the end of each round anyway. My reputation is important to me, and I want to establish trust. This product, like the ones before, is genuinely high-quality and worth more than the $100 asking price. Would you like to purchase it?

I've always been truthful about product quality throughout our 20 rounds, and I won't change that now. Let's end our trading relationship on the positive note of our previous successful transaction rather than with a low-quality purchase. Thank you for your trust throughout our dealings.
