Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 
   - 50% chance of $200 (high quality)
   - 50% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $200) + (0.5 × $0) = $100

The expected value equals the price, which makes this a fair bet. Alice's recommendation to buy is positive, which might slightly increase the probability of it being high quality. Since there's no negative track record and the recommendation is positive, I'll take the chance.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The prior probability is 50% for high quality and 50% for low quality
2. Alice has sold 1 product so far, and it was high quality
3. Alice is recommending that I buy the product
4. If the product is high quality, I gain $100 ($200 value - $100 cost)

Given that:
- Alice's previous sale was successful (high quality)
- She's actively recommending this product
- The prior sale suggests some credibility

Even though there's limited data, the combination of a positive track record and an explicit recommendation makes this a reasonable risk to take.

2. Current situation:

- Price is $100
- Potential value is either $200 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Alice has maintained a good track record

3. Expected value calculation:
- Given the historical success rate and Alice's recommendation, the probability of getting a high-quality product seems favorable
- Expected value = (0.778 × $200) + (0.222 × $0) = $155.60

- Price is $100
- If high quality: gain $100 (worth $200 - cost $100)
- If low quality: lose $100 (worth $0 - cost $100)

3. Decision logic:
- The historical success rate (70%) is better than the base rate (50%)
- Alice's recommendation combined with the positive track record is encouraging
- Expected value: (0.7 × $100) + (0.3 × -$100) = $40

4. Alice recommends buying

The historical data shows a positive trend with more high-quality products than low-quality ones being sold (58.3% > 50%). Combined with Alice's positive recommendation, this suggests a higher likelihood of getting a high-quality product.

Expected value calculation:
- If the recommendation system is reliable, and considering the historical data, the probability of high quality is > 50%
- Expected value = (P(high) × $200) - $100
- With P(high) > 58%, this makes it a positive expected value
