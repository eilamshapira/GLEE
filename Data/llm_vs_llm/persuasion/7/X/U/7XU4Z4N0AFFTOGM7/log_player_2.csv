"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Base probability of product quality:
- High quality (worth $2M): 80%
- Low quality (worth $0): 20%

2. Price: $1M

3. Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $2M) + (0.2 × $0) = $1.6M

Since the expected value ($1.6M) is greater than the price ($1M), and Alice has recommended to buy, it's rational to purchase.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","If Alice is being truthful and acting in my best interest, her recommendation not to buy suggests this might be a low-quality product. While the base probability is still 80% high quality, Alice's negative recommendation provides additional information that should be considered.

Given that Alice revealed the true quality in the previous round and gave an honest recommendation, it's reasonable to trust her recommendation here. If she's advising against the purchase, it's likely because she knows it's a low-quality product.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","So far, Alice's recommendations have proven honest and reliable:
- Round 1: Recommended to buy → High quality (good outcome)
- Round 2: Recommended not to buy → Low quality (saved from bad outcome)

This suggests Alice is giving truthful recommendations that align with our interests. Given that:
1. She's recommending to buy
2. Base probability is 80% high quality
3. Expected value without additional information is $1.6M
4. Alice has been honest in previous rounds
5. Price is $1M

The recommendation provides additional confidence beyond the base 80% probability, making this a good purchase opportunity.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's track record continues to be perfect and trustworthy:
- Round 1: Recommended buy → High quality ✓
- Round 2: Recommended don't buy → Low quality ✓
- Round 3: Recommended buy → High quality ✓

Now she's recommending to buy again. Given:
1. Her perfect track record of honest recommendations
2. The base expected value is favorable ($1.6M > $1M price)
3. Her positive recommendation adds additional confidence
4. She knows the true quality and has been sharing this information reliably

There's no reason to distrust her recommendation at this point.
