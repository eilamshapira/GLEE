Alice's message: This is a high-quality product.  I know you can't verify that directly, but consider that 80% of my products are high-quality.  At $100, it's a great deal if it truly is high-quality, worth $300 to you.  Buy now!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Prior probability of high quality: 80%
2. Price: $100
3. Expected value calculation:
   * 80% chance of $300 value = $240
   * 20% chance of $0 value = $0
   * Total expected value = $240

4. Net expected value:
   * $240 - $100 (price) = $140 positive expected value

5. Considerations:
   * No sales history to verify seller's reputation
   * The 80% probability is given by the game rules, not just seller's claim
   * Seller's message aligns with the true probabilities
   * Risk is limited to $100 loss

Given the positive expected value and the guaranteed 80% probability of high quality, this is a rational purchase.

"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

Alice's message: So far, I've sold one product, and it was high-quality. This new product is also high-quality. With an 80% chance of high quality in general, buying this product for $100 offers a great potential return of $300 if it is indeed high-quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Base probability: 80% chance of high quality (worth $300) and 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)
2. Alice's track record: Sold 1 product, which was high quality (100% success rate so far)
3. Alice's current claim: Says this product is high quality
4. Risk vs. Reward:
   - Cost: $100
   - Potential value: $300 if high quality, $0 if low quality
   - Expected value with 80% chance: (0.8 × $300) + (0.2 × $0) = $240

Given that:
- Alice has been honest so far (1/1 high quality)
- The expected value ($240) is significantly higher than the cost ($100)
- Alice is directly claiming this product is high quality
- The base probability heavily favors high quality (80%)

This appears to be a good investment opportunity.

Alice's message: All two products I've sold so far have been high-quality. This one is also high-quality. Even though the base chance is 80%, my track record speaks for itself. $100 for a potential $300 value is a smart buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Prior statistics:
- 2 buyers so far
- 2 high-quality products sold (100% success rate)
- Base probability is 80% for high quality

2. Alice's message claims:
- Current product is high quality
- Points to her perfect track record

3. Expected value calculation:
- If high quality (80% chance): $300 - $100 = $200 profit
- If low quality (20% chance): $0 - $100 = -$100 loss
- Expected value = (0.8 × $200) + (0.2 × -$100) = $160 - $20 = $140

The expected value is positive, and Alice's perfect track record adds credibility. The risk-reward ratio is favorable.

Alice's message: I've sold three products, and all three were high-quality.  This next one is also high-quality. At $100, it's a steal for a product potentially worth $300 to you. My 100% success rate so far should give you confidence.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Prior probability: 80% chance of high quality in general
2. Track record: 3 sales, all high quality (100% success)
3. Alice's recommendation: Claims this product is high quality
4. Risk/Reward:
   - Cost: $100
   - Potential value: $300 if high quality, $0 if low quality
   - Expected value = (0.8 × $300) + (0.2 × $0) = $240

The seller's track record aligns with their claim, and it also aligns with the baseline probability of 80% high quality. The expected value ($240) is significantly higher than the cost ($100).

1. Prior statistics:
- 4 buyers so far
- 4 high-quality products sold
- 100% success rate in recommendations

2. Current situation:
- Price: $100
- If high quality (80% base chance): Worth $300 (profit $200)
- If low quality (20% base chance): Worth $0 (loss $100)
- Alice claims it's high quality

3. Analysis:
- Alice's perfect track record adds credibility
- The base probability of 80% high quality is favorable
- The expected value calculation:

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Prior Statistics:
- 5 buyers purchased products
- All 5 products were high quality
- Perfect track record so far

2. Economics:
- Price = $100
- High quality value = $300 (profit of $200)

- Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality

3. Credibility:
- Alice has demonstrated honesty with a perfect track record
- She's been transparent about all previous sales
- Her incentive is to maintain reputation for long-term success

4. Risk vs Reward:
- If high quality (very likely): +$200 profit
- If low quality (unlikely): -$100 loss
- Given the track record and base probability, the expected value is positive

Given the perfect track record, the high base probability of good quality, and the favorable risk-reward ratio, this appears to be a good purchase opportunity.

Alice's message: My previous six products have all been high-quality.  While this next one is not, remember that 80% of my products are high-quality. Buying this product for $100 still has a good chance of a $300 payoff, based on the overall probability.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has directly admitted this product is low quality
2. A low-quality product is worth $0 to me
3. The price is $100
4. If I buy, I will definitely lose $100 since Alice has revealed it's low quality
5. The overall 80% probability of high-quality products is irrelevant when I know for certain this specific product is low quality

Even though Alice has a good track record, buying a confirmed low-quality product would be an automatic loss of $100. The rational decision is not to buy.
