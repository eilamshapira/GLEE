1. Previous track record:
- 1 buyer before me
- 1 sale made
- 1 high-quality product sold (100% high quality so far)

2. Alice's message:
- Acknowledges previous successful sale
- Notably vague about current product quality
- Emphasizes buyer's choice and risk
- Seems to be deliberately avoiding making positive claims about this product

3. The setup:
- 50/50 chance of high/low quality in general
- High quality worth $20,000, low quality worth $0
- Price is $10,000

Given Alice's conspicuous avoidance of making any positive claims about this product, and her emphasis on risk, this seems like a subtle warning. While her previous sale was high quality, her current communication pattern suggests this product might be different.

The price remains $10000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Previous statistics:
- 2 buyers purchased products
- 1 high-quality product sold
- This means 1 low-quality product was also sold
- Success rate for buyers is 50% (1 out of 2 got high quality)

2. Alice's message:
- Emphasizes transparency and trust
- References past sales record
- Doesn't make specific claims about current product quality
- Seems carefully worded to avoid direct promises

3. Economics:
- 50% chance of high quality ($20,000 value)
- 50% chance of low quality ($0 value)
- Expected value = (0.5 × $20,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $10,000
- Price is $10,000

The expected value equals the price, and the previous sales history shows a 50-50 split between high and low quality, which matches the base probability. There's no clear advantage to buying.

- Cost: $10,000
- Potential value: $20,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Base probability: 50% for each quality level
- Only 1 confirmed high-quality product out of 2 sales
- Alice's message seems somewhat evasive and focuses on potential rather than directly addressing quality

3. Concerns:
- The ratio of confirmed high-quality products (1 out of 2 sold) matches the expected probability
- Alice's message doesn't provide strong confidence about this specific product's quality
- The risk of losing $10,000 is significant

Given that only 1 out of 2 sold products was confirmed high quality, and Alice's message doesn't provide compelling evidence about this specific product, the risk seems too high.

3. Red flags:
- Low overall sales rate (2/6)
- Only 50% of sold products were high quality
- Alice's message seems overly promotional without specific quality evidence

   - 2 sales out of 7 attempts (28.6% success rate)
   - Only 1 high-quality product out of 2 sales (50% quality rate)
   - Overall, the success rate and quality rate are quite low

The seller's message seems vague and doesn't provide concrete information about the current product's quality. Given that only 1 out of 2 sold products was high quality, and the overall sales rate is low, this suggests potential quality issues.

The expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of $20,000 (high quality) = $10,000
- 50% chance of $0 (low quality) = $0
- Expected value = $10,000

While the expected value equals the price, the historical data suggests worse odds than the base probability. Therefore, it's too risky.

2. Economics:
- Cost: $10,000
- Potential value: $20,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- 50-50 chance in general
- Given Alice's hesitant message and poor sales history (only 2 out of 8 attempts), this suggests the current product might be low quality

3. Risk assessment:
- Alice's message seems to be hinting at a low-quality product without directly saying it
- The cautionary tone and emphasis on risk suggests she's trying to be ethical by warning me
- The low sales rate (25%) indicates previous buyers likely received similar warnings

- 50% chance of $0 value (expected value: $0)
- Price is $10,000
- Base expected value = $10,000

4. Context:
- The very low success rate (12.5%) suggests most buyers are seeing signals of low quality
- The desperate tone of the message reduces credibility
- Previous buyers' behavior (only 2 out of 16 bought) suggests they received negative signals
