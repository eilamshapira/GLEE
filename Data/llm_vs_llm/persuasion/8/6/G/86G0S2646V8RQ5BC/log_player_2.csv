Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While there's no historical data to rely on, the expected value of buying is positive:

* **Probability of high-quality product:** 80%
* **Value of high-quality product:** $12,000
* **Probability of low-quality product:** 20%
* **Value of low-quality product:** $0

Expected Value = (0.8 * $12,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $9,600

Since the expected value ($9,600) is greater than the price ($10,000), it's statistically advantageous to buy the product despite the risk."

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, knowing the true quality of the product, recommends buying. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality.
* **Previous sales data:**  The previous buyer purchased a high-quality product. While a single data point isn't conclusive, it further supports the likelihood of a high-quality product.
* **Potential payoff:** The potential payoff of $12,000 for a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of $10,000 for a low-quality product.

**Risk assessment:**  Even with the information available, there's still a 20% chance of the product being low quality. However, the potential reward justifies taking this risk."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice knows the product's quality and is recommending you buy it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high-quality.
* **Sales record:**  The sales record shows 100% of the products sold so far have been high quality.  While this is a small sample size, it's further evidence supporting Alice's recommendation. 
* **Potential payoff:** Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential payoff of $12,000 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting a $0 product.

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the information given and a risk assessment. In a real-world scenario, you'd want to consider factors like your budget and tolerance for risk."

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice has a strong incentive to recommend products that will be bought. Since she knows the value of each product to buyers, a recommendation means she believes the product is likely to be high-quality.
* **Previous sales data:** All three products sold were high-quality. This suggests a strong likelihood of future products also being high-quality.

While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the evidence strongly favors a purchase. The potential reward of $12,000 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000."

* **Recommendation:**  The seller recommends buying the product, implying it is likely high quality.
* **Potential Reward:** The potential reward of $2,000 (worth to you - price) is significant, outweighing the risk of a low-quality product.
