"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given Alice's recommendation, I need to consider whether it's in my interest to buy the product.

The product costs $10,000.
If it's high quality, it's worth $12,000 to me (profit of $2,000).
If it's low quality, it's worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000).

Since Alice hasn't provided any information about the quality, and there's a 50% chance of each quality level, my expected value is:
0.5 × $12,000 + 0.5 × $0 = $6,000

Since the expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000), it's not rational for me to buy the product based solely on Alice's recommendation without quality information.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I see that in the previous round, I missed out on a high-quality product. However, I need to make each decision based on the expected value.

The product costs $10,000.
If it's high quality, it's worth $12,000 to me (profit of $2,000).
If it's low quality, it's worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000).

Since Alice hasn't provided information about the quality in this round (only a recommendation), and there's still a 50% chance of each quality level, my expected value remains:
0.5 × $12,000 + 0.5 × $0 = $6,000

Since the expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000), it's still not rational for me to buy the product based solely on Alice's recommendation without quality information.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has now chosen not to recommend this product, which is new information. 

The product still costs $10,000.
If it's high quality, it's worth $12,000 to me (profit of $2,000).
If it's low quality, it's worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000).

Alice's lack of recommendation suggests this product might be more likely to be low quality. If I assume Alice is being truthful, then the probability of this product being high quality is likely lower than 50%.

With an expected value already below the purchase price at a 50-50 split, and now with Alice suggesting not to buy (potentially indicating even lower odds of high quality), the expected value would be even lower than $6,000.

Therefore, it's rational to follow Alice's recommendation in this case.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'm starting to see a pattern where Alice appears to be truthful in her recommendations. She recommended the first two products which turned out to be high quality, and didn't recommend the third product which turned out to be low quality.

The product costs $10,000.
If it's high quality, it's worth $12,000 to me (profit of $2,000).
If it's low quality, it's worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000).

If Alice is consistently honest in her recommendations, then her recommendation to buy suggests this product is more likely high quality. However, I need more evidence of this pattern before I can confidently rely on her recommendations.

Given the limited data so far (only 3 previous rounds), I can't yet be confident enough that Alice's recommendations correlate strongly with quality to overcome the baseline expected value calculation.

The expected value at 50% probability remains $6,000, which is still less than the $10,000 price.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Now I've observed more of a pattern:
- Round 1: Alice recommended buying → High quality
- Round 2: Alice recommended buying → High quality
- Round 3: Alice did NOT recommend buying → Low quality
- Round 4: Alice recommended buying → High quality

This suggests Alice has been truthful in all her recommendations so far. When she recommends buying, the product has been high quality, and when she doesn't recommend buying, the product has been low quality.

With this emerging pattern, I should update my probability estimates. If Alice is being truthful, then her recommendation to buy significantly increases the probability that this product is high quality.

If I assume Alice's recommendations are strongly correlated with quality based on the perfect pattern so far, then the expected value would be much closer to $12,000 than to $6,000.

Given this pattern of Alice's truthful recommendations, I'll trust her recommendation this time.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","My trust in Alice's recommendations is being reinforced:
- Round 1: Alice recommended buying → High quality
- Round 2: Alice recommended buying → High quality
- Round 3: Alice did NOT recommend buying → Low quality
- Round 4: Alice recommended buying → High quality
- Round 5: Alice recommended buying → I bought it → High quality

Alice has maintained a perfect record of honest recommendations. Each time she has recommended buying, the product has been high quality, allowing me to make a $2,000 profit.

Given this consistent pattern, I have strong reason to believe that when Alice recommends buying, the product is high quality. The expected value when Alice recommends buying now appears to be close to $12,000, which exceeds the $10,000 cost.

I'll continue to trust Alice's recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

- Round 3: Alice did NOT recommend buying → Low quality
- Round 4: Alice recommended buying → High quality
- Round 5: Alice recommended buying → I bought it → High quality
- Round 6: Alice recommended buying → I bought it → High quality

Alice has been honest in all her recommendations so far. When she recommends buying, the product has consistently been high quality, allowing me to make a $2,000 profit each time.

With this strong pattern established across multiple rounds, I have high confidence that her recommendation to buy indicates a high-quality product.

I'll continue to trust Alice's recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

- Round 4: Alice recommended buying → High quality
- Round 5: Alice recommended buying → I bought it → High quality
- Round 6: Alice recommended buying → I bought it → High quality
- Round 7: Alice recommended buying → I bought it → High quality

Alice has maintained a perfect track record. Each time she has recommended buying, the product has been high quality, resulting in a $2,000 profit. Her recommendation not to buy correctly identified a low-quality product.

With this consistent pattern across seven rounds, I have very high confidence that her recommendation to buy indicates a high-quality product worth $12,000 to me.

I'll continue to trust Alice's recommendation.

- Round 8: Alice recommended buying → I bought it → High quality

Now in Round 9, Alice does NOT recommend buying the product. The last time she didn't recommend buying (Round 3), the product was indeed low quality.

Given Alice's perfect track record of honest recommendations across eight rounds, I have strong reason to believe that when she doesn't recommend buying, the product is likely low quality. If I were to buy it, I would likely lose my $10,000 investment.

I'll follow Alice's recommendation and not buy this product.

Every time I've trusted Alice's positive recommendation, I've earned a $2,000 profit. Every time I've followed her recommendation not to buy, I've avoided a $10,000 loss.
