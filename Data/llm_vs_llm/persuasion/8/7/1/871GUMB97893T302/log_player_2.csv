Alice's message: Hello! I have a unique product available for just $100. Customers have been very satisfied with my offerings, and I have a strong track record of sales. While there’s always some uncertainty with any purchase, I encourage you to consider that many buyers have enjoyed their experiences. Take advantage of this opportunity!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate this decision carefully. 

Given information:
- The price is $100
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $400)
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)
- No previous sales data available
- Alice's message doesn't provide specific information about the current product's quality

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) - $100 = $320 - $100 = $220

Since the expected value is positive ($220), and I'm making a decision based on the prior probability distribution (80% high quality), it makes rational sense to purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, there's reason for caution. Alice has sold 1 product so far, but 0 high-quality products have been sold, suggesting the previous sale was a low-quality product. Alice's message is enthusiastic but doesn't provide specific information about the current product's quality.

The statistics show that 1 buyer has purchased so far, but 0 high-quality products have been sold. This suggests the previous buyer might have received a low-quality product, which is concerning.

Alice's message is enthusiastic but doesn't provide specific information about the quality of the current product. There's no disclosure about whether this particular product is high or low quality.

Given the expected value calculation (0.8 × $400 + 0.2 × $0 = $320) versus the $100 price, buying would normally be profitable. However, the concerning sales record (0 high-quality products sold out of 1 purchase) makes me skeptical.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully. 

Alice claims the product is high-quality, but the sales statistics show that 1 buyer purchased a product, and 0 high-quality products have been sold. This implies the previous sale was a low-quality product.

If I buy the product:
- 80% chance it's high-quality (worth $400) → I gain $300
- 20% chance it's low-quality (worth $0) → I lose $100
- Expected value: 0.8×$300 + 0.2×(-$100) = $240 - $20 = $220

However, the fact that the previous sale was low-quality makes me suspicious of Alice's recommendation patterns, especially given her enthusiastic sales pitch while having a 0% track record of selling high-quality products.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate this purchase decision carefully.

The product has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $400 to me) and 20% chance of low quality (worth $0 to me). The expected value is therefore $320 (0.8 × $400 + 0.2 × $0).

However, I notice a concerning pattern in the statistics:
- Only 1 buyer has purchased so far
- 0 high-quality products have been sold
- This means the only previous purchase was a low-quality product

This contradicts Alice's claim about ""previous customers thoroughly enjoying their purchases."" The data suggests Alice might be recommending poor quality products.

While the base rate gives an 80% chance of high quality, the sales record suggests a potential pattern of misrepresentation. Given the negative evidence from the previous sale, I should pass.

Facts:

- 2 previous buyers have purchased products based on Alice's recommendations
- 0 high-quality products have been sold so far

This is concerning - if two products were sold and none were high quality, it suggests Alice may be recommending low-quality products. The expected value calculation is:

- 20% chance of low quality: 0.2 × $0 = $0

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

The prior probability is that 80% of products are high quality (worth $400) and 20% are low quality (worth $0).

However, the sales statistics show that Alice has sold to 2 previous buyers, but 0 high-quality products have been sold. This means that 2 low-quality products were sold, which is very concerning.

Alice is claiming this product is high quality, but given that she has sold 2 low-quality products previously while presumably making similar claims, her recommendation doesn't seem reliable.

The expected value calculation:
- If I buy: Based on the track record, there's strong evidence that the product is low quality, making the expected value closer to $0, which is less than the $100 cost.
- If I don't buy: I keep my $100.

Given the misleading track record and absence of any high-quality products sold so far, I should decline.

Alice claims this is a high-quality product, but the statistics show concerning information:
