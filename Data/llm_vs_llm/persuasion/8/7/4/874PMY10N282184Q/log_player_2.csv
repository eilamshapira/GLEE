Alice's message: Greetings! I'm offering a fantastic product today with an excellent chance of being high-quality. While I can't guarantee its specific quality beforehand, I can tell you that these products have historically been very well-received. At $100, it's a worthwhile investment considering the potential value you'll receive.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Facts:
- Each product has an 80% chance of being high quality
- High quality is worth $125 to me, low quality is worth $0
- The product costs $100
- No sales history yet
- Alice hasn't explicitly stated the quality of this specific product

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of $125 value = $100 expected value
- 20% chance of $0 value = $0 expected value
- Total expected value = $100

Since the expected value equals the price of $100, this is a fair offer. The positive expected value makes this a reasonable purchase.

Alice's message: Hello! I have a product available for $100. These products offer great potential, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile purchase. Don't miss out!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

Alice's recommendation doesn't specifically tell me whether this particular product is high or low quality. So far, 1 buyer has purchased based on Alice's recommendations, and 1 high-quality product has been sold, which is encouraging.

Given the information provided:
- The product costs $100
- If high quality (80% chance), it's worth $125 to me (profit of $25)
- If low quality (20% chance), it's worth $0 to me (loss of $100)

The expected value calculation is:
(0.8 × $25) + (0.2 × -$100) = $20 - $20 = $0

While the expected value is neutral, the prior probability of 80% for high quality and the fact that the previously sold product was high quality slightly tilts my decision toward buying.

Alice's message: Good day! I'm offering a product with a strong track record of high customer satisfaction. For just $100, you have the opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. I believe this product will exceed your expectations.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze the situation:

- The product costs $100
- If high quality (80% chance), it's worth $125 to me (profit of $25)
- If low quality (20% chance), it's worth $0 to me (loss of $100)
- Expected value: 0.8 × $125 + 0.2 × $0 - $100 = $100 - $100 = $0

Looking at the sales record:
- 2 buyers purchased products
- 1 high-quality product sold

This means at least one low-quality product was sold, which is concerning. The ratio of high-quality products sold (1/2 = 50%) is lower than the expected 80%, suggesting Alice might be overselling low-quality products.

Given this information, the expected value is at best neutral, and the sales record raises concerns.

Alice's message: Hi there! I'm offering a product for $100. It's a great opportunity to acquire something potentially very valuable. I encourage you to take a chance - you won't regret it!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this carefully.

The product costs $100. If it's high quality, it's worth $125 to me (profit of $25). If it's low quality, it's worth $0 (loss of $100).

From the statistics:
- 2 buyers purchased products
- Only 1 high-quality product has been sold

This means one of the sold products was likely low quality. The prior probability is 80% high quality, but the sales record suggests a 50% rate of high quality products actually being sold.

Alice's message is generic and doesn't provide specific information about the quality of my particular product. Without a clear indication that this product is high quality, the expected value calculation doesn't favor purchasing:

Expected value = 0.8 × $25 + 0.2 × (-$100) = $20 - $20 = $0

Given the statistics suggesting possibly worse odds than the prior probability, I should decline.

Alice's message: Greetings! Today I am offering a product for $100. This is a great opportunity to potentially acquire something of considerable value. I highly recommend you seize this chance!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate this carefully. 

Alice has sold 2 products, but only 1 high-quality product so far, which means 1 low-quality product was also sold. The current recommendation lacks specific information about the quality of this particular product.

Let me check the expected value:
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $125) = 0.8 × $125 = $100
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0) = 0.2 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $100

The expected value equals the price of $100, making this a break-even proposition. Additionally, Alice's previous sales include a low-quality product, which gives me reason to be cautious.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to consider the available statistics carefully.

From the statistics, Alice has had 2 previous buyers who purchased products based on her recommendations. Of those, only 1 was a high-quality product. This means that 50% of the sold products were high quality, which is lower than the baseline probability of 80% high-quality products.

Alice hasn't explicitly stated whether the current product is high or low quality. Her message is promotional but doesn't contain specific information about the product quality.

Given that:
- The expected value of a random product is (0.8 × $125) + (0.2 × $0) = $100
- The actual observed quality ratio (50%) is worse than the baseline (80%)
- Alice hasn't provided specific quality information about this product

The expected value based on the observed data is lower than the price, so I should decline.

Alice's recommendation is positive but vague and doesn't explicitly state the quality. The sales record shows only 50% of sold products were high quality, which is worse than the prior 80% probability. This suggests Alice may be recommending both high and low quality products.

Expected value calculation:
If I assume a 50% chance of high quality based on past sales:
EV = 0.5 × $25 + 0.5 × (-$100) = $12.5 - $50 = -$37.5

This is a negative expected value, so I should not buy.
