Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. Each product has a 50/50 chance of being high/low quality
2. Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending this product
3. If Alice is being truthful, this suggests the product is likely low quality
4. A low-quality product would be worth $0, while I'd have to pay $1,000,000
5. A high-quality product would give me $2,000,000 profit ($3M - $1M)
6. Given Alice's negative recommendation and no prior history to evaluate her truthfulness, it's too risky

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The product has a 50% chance of being high quality ($3M value) and 50% chance of low quality ($0 value)
2. The price is $1M
3. Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying
4. There's no prior sales history to judge Alice's trustworthiness

Since Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase, this suggests the product is likely low quality. If the product is low quality, I would lose $1M by buying it.

Given Alice's direct negative recommendation and no conflicting evidence from past sales, the safest decision is not to buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this logically:

1. The expected value calculation:
* High quality (50%): $3,000,000 × 0.5 = $1,500,000
* Low quality (50%): $0 × 0.5 = $0
* Total expected value = $1,500,000

2. Cost = $1,000,000

3. Considerations:
* Alice knows the true quality
* Alice does not recommend buying
* There's no previous sales history to establish trust
* Alice has no incentive to lie since she gets the same price either way

Given that Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase, this strongly suggests this is a low-quality product. If it were high quality, she would likely recommend it since she gets the same price either way.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. Alice knows the true quality of the product and its value to me
2. Alice isn't recommending the purchase
3. Given Alice knows the product's true quality, her negative recommendation likely indicates it's a low-quality product
4. If it's low-quality:
   * Cost: $1,000,000
   * Value: $0
   * Net loss: -$1,000,000

Given Alice's negative recommendation and the lack of contrary evidence from previous sales, it's most likely a low-quality product that would result in a significant loss.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The seller knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase
2. No prior sales history to evaluate Alice's credibility
3. Base probabilities: 50% high quality ($3M value) and 50% low quality ($0 value)
4. Price is $1M
5. Alice has no incentive to lie since a reputation hasn't been established yet

Given Alice knows the true quality and is recommending against the purchase, it's likely that this is a low-quality product. There's no reason for Alice to discourage the sale of a high-quality product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The product costs $1,000,000

3. If low quality, I gain $0 (net loss $1,000,000)
4. Base probability is 50/50
5. Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying
6. Alice's incentive is to sell, so her not recommending suggests it's likely low quality

Since Alice has an incentive to sell but still recommends against buying, this is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. Therefore, I should not buy.

5. Alice knows the true quality and has no sales history yet

Given that Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If it were high quality, she would likely recommend it to establish a good reputation.

4. Alice has recommended buying the product, which could be a positive signal
   
Since the expected value ($1,500,000) is higher than the price ($1,000,000), and Alice has recommended the purchase, it's a rational decision to buy.

4. Alice's recommendation: Negative

Given that:
- Alice knows the true value and is not recommending the purchase
- The previous sale was a high-quality product
- Alice has been honest so far (as evidenced by the successful high-quality sale)
- A negative recommendation likely means this is a low-quality product
- If it's low quality, I would lose my entire investment

The negative recommendation from a seller who has shown honesty (1/1 high-quality sales) is a strong signal that this product is likely low quality. The risk of losing $1,000,000 is too high.

Alice has shown honesty in previous sale (1/1 high quality), which builds some credibility. However, she is specifically recommending NOT to buy this product. Given that Alice knows the true quality and has proven truthful so far, her negative recommendation strongly suggests this is a low-quality product.

If it's low quality, I would lose my entire $1,000,000 investment. The risk is too high, especially with an explicit warning from a seller who has demonstrated honesty.

4. Alice is recommending to buy

The fact that the previous sale was a high-quality product and Alice is recommending this one is encouraging. Alice seems to be honest with her recommendations based on the track record. The expected value calculation also works in favor of buying:

50% chance of $3,000,000 = $1,500,000 expected value
This is greater than the $1,000,000 price.

- Alice is recommending this product
