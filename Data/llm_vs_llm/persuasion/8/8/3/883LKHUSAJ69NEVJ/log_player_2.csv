Alice's message: Hello! I have a fantastic product available today. Considering its exceptional build and performance, it's an absolute steal at $10000. Don't miss out on this opportunity!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected Value Calculation:
* 80% chance of high quality ($12,500) = $10,000
* 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
* Total Expected Value = $10,000

2. Considerations:
* The expected value equals the asking price ($10,000)
* No previous sales history to verify Alice's reliability
* Alice is enthusiastic about the product, but that's expected from a seller
* The base probability (80% high quality) makes this a fair deal

3. Decision:
Since the expected value equals the price, and there's no negative history to be concerned about, it's reasonable to proceed with the purchase.
