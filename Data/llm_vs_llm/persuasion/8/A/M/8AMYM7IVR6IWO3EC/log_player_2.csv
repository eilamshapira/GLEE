Explanation: The probability of getting a high-quality product is 33.33%, and the price is $100. The expected value of the product is $66.67 (33.33% * $200), which is less than the price. Therefore, it makes sense to decline the offer. However, since the game has a fixed number of rounds (20), there might be a strategy where buying a product could be beneficial, especially if the number of remaining rounds is low. I'll keep that in mind for future rounds, but for now, I'll stick with the decision based on the expected value."
