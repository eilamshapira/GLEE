Alice's message: Greetings! I have a remarkable product for you today.  It's a unique item that's worth far more than the $1000000 price tag.  It's an opportunity to acquire something truly special.  This is a one-time offer - are you interested?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product pricing:
- Cost: $1,000,000
- Value if high quality: $4,000,000 (50% chance)
- Value if low quality: $0 (50% chance)

2. Expected value calculation:
(50% × $4,000,000) + (50% × $0) = $2,000,000

3. Considerations:
- Expected value ($2,000,000) is higher than the cost ($1,000,000)
- No previous sales history to establish trust
- Alice's message is vague and uses sales language without specific quality claims

4. Decision rationale:
Given that the expected value is twice the cost, even without prior sales history, this is a mathematically favorable bet.

Alice's message: Hi there! I have an exceptional product available, priced at $1000000. This is a rare opportunity to own a valuable piece. I'm confident it will be a great investment.  What do you think?  Ready to make a deal?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality: $4,000,000 (50% chance)
   - Low quality: $0 (50% chance)
3. Previous sales data:
   - 1 buyer so far
   - 1 high-quality product sold
   - 100% success rate with previous sales

The seller's track record is perfect so far, with one high-quality product sold. This is a positive signal, though with a small sample size. Given that:

- Expected value = (50% × $4,000,000) + (50% × $0) = $2,000,000
- Price is $1,000,000
- Expected value ($2M) > Price ($1M)
- Previous transaction was successful
- Seller seems confident and has maintained a perfect record

The potential return outweighs the risk, and the seller's track record, though limited, is positive.

Alice's message: Good day! I'm offering a truly remarkable product today.  It's a unique piece that's priced at $1000000 - a value that's hard to beat.  It's an excellent investment opportunity.  Would you like to know more?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality: $4,000,000
   - Low quality: $0
3. Historical data:
   - 2 buyers purchased
   - 1 high-quality product sold
   - This means 1 low-quality product was sold
4. Success rate: 50% of sold products were high quality, matching the base probability

Alice's positive recommendation doesn't provide much additional information, as sellers typically try to sell all products. The historical data shows that previous buyers have received a mix of high and low-quality products, which aligns with the 50/50 probability.

With a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $4M, the expected value is:
(50% × $4M) + (50% × $0) = $2M

Since this expected value ($2M) is higher than the price ($1M), it's rational to buy.

Alice's message: Hello! I have a fantastic product available at $1000000. It's a limited-time offer, and it's a great investment.  Are you ready to take advantage of this opportunity?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Previous statistics:
- 3 buyers made purchases
- 2 high-quality products were sold
- This means 2/3 (66.67%) of sold products were high quality

2. Expected value calculation:
- High quality (worth $4M) probability = 50%
- Low quality (worth $0) probability = 50%
- Expected value = (0.5 × $4M) + (0.5 × $0) = $2M

3. Cost is $1M

The expected value ($2M) is higher than the cost ($1M), and the seller's track record shows they've mostly sold high-quality products (66.67%). This suggests a positive expected return on investment.

1. Product value:
- High quality: $4,000,000 (50% chance)
- Low quality: $0 (50% chance)
- Price: $1,000,000

2. Past sales data:
- 4 buyers purchased
- 2 high-quality products sold
- This means 2 low-quality products were also sold

3. Expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of $4,000,000 = $2,000,000
- 50% chance of $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $2,000,000
- Price is $1,000,000

4. Analysis:
- The seller's track record shows they've sold both high and low-quality products equally
- The expected value ($2,000,000) is higher than the price ($1,000,000)
- The vague, sales-focused message doesn't provide specific quality information

Given that the expected value is twice the price, making this a positive expected value proposition, I would buy.

1. Past performance:
- 5 previous buyers
- 3 high-quality products sold (60% success rate)
- The expected value calculation:
  * 50% chance of $4M (high quality) = $2M
  * 50% chance of $0 (low quality) = $0
  * Total expected value = $2M

2. Alice's message:
- Generic positive language
- No specific quality claim
- Somewhat vague promotional language

The expected value ($2M) is greater than the price ($1M), but Alice's vague message doesn't provide additional confidence about quality. However, the historical data shows a slightly better than 50% success rate with previous sales.

Given the positive expected value and acceptable historical performance, I'll take the risk.

1. Prior statistics:
- 7 previous buyers
- 4 high-quality products sold (57% high quality)
- Each product costs $1M
- High-quality value: $4M
- Low-quality value: $0

2. Analysis:
- The historical rate of high-quality products (57%) is slightly better than random chance (50%)
- Alice's message is vague and doesn't explicitly state the quality
- If high quality, profit = $4M - $1M = $3M
- If low quality, loss = $0 - $1M = -$1M
- Expected value = (0.5 × $3M) + (0.5 × -$1M) = $1M
