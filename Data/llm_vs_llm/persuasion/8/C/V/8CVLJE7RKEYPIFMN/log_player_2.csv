"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at the game scenario carefully:

- Alice knows the true quality of each product
- The product costs $1,000,000
- High quality is worth $1,250,000 to me (profit of $250,000)
- Low quality is worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000)
- Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality

Alice doesn't recommend buying this product. Since she knows the true quality, this likely signals it's low quality. If I buy a low-quality product, I'll lose $1,000,000.

The expected value calculation doesn't justify buying against Alice's recommendation when she has perfect information.
