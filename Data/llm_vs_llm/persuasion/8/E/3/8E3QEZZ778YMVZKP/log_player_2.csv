Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality (33.33%): $125
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (33.33% × $125) + (66.67% × $0) = $41.66

4. Considerations:
   - Expected value ($41.66) is less than price ($100)
   - No previous sales history to verify Alice's reliability
   - Alice's recommendation could be biased as she wants to make sales
   - First-mover disadvantage (no prior information)

Given that the expected value is significantly lower than the price, and there's no historical data to trust Alice's recommendation, it would not be rational to buy.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Base probability of quality:
- High quality: 33.33% (worth $125)
- Low quality: 66.67% (worth $0)

2. Expected value calculation:
(0.3333 × $125) + (0.6667 × $0) = $41.66

3. Price is $100

4. There's no historical data to reference

5. Alice recommends buying, but since there's no track record yet, it's hard to judge the reliability of her recommendations

Since the expected value ($41.66) is significantly less than the price ($100), and there's no historical data to suggest Alice's recommendations are reliable, it would be economically unwise to purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $125 profit ($25 net gain)
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): $0 ($100 loss)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (0.3333 × $125) + (0.6667 × $0) - $100 = $41.66 - $100 = -$58.34

4. Considerations:
   - No sales history to verify Alice's reliability
   - Alice's recommendation could be biased
   - Expected value is negative
   - Higher probability of loss than gain

Based on the negative expected value and lack of historical data to trust the seller's recommendation, I should decline.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this scenario:

1. Product price: $100
2. High quality (33.33% chance): Worth $125 to me
3. Low quality (66.67% chance): Worth $0 to me

Expected value calculation:
* (0.3333 × $125) + (0.6667 × $0) = $41.67

Even with Alice's recommendation, the expected value ($41.67) is less than the price ($100). There's no sales history to help validate Alice's trustworthiness, and she has an incentive to sell regardless of quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this scenario:

1. Cost of product: $100
2. Value if high quality: $125 (profit of $25)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $100)
4. Base probability: 33.33% high quality, 66.67% low quality
5. Alice has recommended to buy, but:
   - No sales history to establish trust
   - Alice has incentive to sell regardless of quality
   - Expected value = (0.3333 × $125) + (0.6667 × $0) = $41.66

The expected value ($41.66) is less than the cost ($100), and there's no track record to modify the base probabilities. Even with Alice's recommendation, it's too risky.
