Would you like to buy the current product?","In the scenario provided:

- 3 buyers have purchased the products, and all 3 of these products were high-quality.
- Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Given that Alice's track record shows a 100% rate of recommending only high-quality products so far, it significantly increases the confidence that the current recommendation might also be a high-quality product worth $20,000, which is above the fixed price of $10,000.

Therefore, based on the information and recommendations, the decision would be:
