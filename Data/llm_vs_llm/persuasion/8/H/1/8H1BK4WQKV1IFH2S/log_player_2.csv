Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Base probability:
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $2M)
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)
- Price is $1M

2. Expected value without additional information:
(0.8 × $2M) + (0.2 × $0) = $1.6M

3. Considerations:
- Expected value ($1.6M) > Price ($1M)
- Alice knows the true quality and recommends buying
- Alice has incentive to be truthful to build reputation
- No previous sales history to reference

Since the expected value exceeds the price and Alice recommends buying, it's rational to purchase.

1. Initial probability distribution:
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $2M)
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)

2. Previous sales data:
- 1 buyer so far
- 1 high-quality product sold
- This matches the expected distribution

3. Alice's recommendation:
- Alice is recommending to buy
- Alice knows the true value

4. Expected value calculation:
- If high quality (80%): $2M × 0.8 = $1.6M
- If low quality (20%): $0 × 0.2 = $0
- Total expected value = $1.6M

5. Decision:
- Cost is $1M
- Expected value is $1.6M
- Expected profit = $1.6M - $1M = $0.6M
- Positive expected value

Since the expected value ($1.6M) is greater than the cost ($1M), and Alice's previous sale aligns with the expected distribution, it's rational to buy.

1. Prior probability of high quality: 80%

3. Expected value without additional information:
   * High quality (80%): $2,000,000 × 0.8 = $1,600,000
   * Low quality (20%): $0 × 0.2 = $0
   * Total expected value = $1,600,000

4. Additional information:
   * Alice recommends buying
   * Previous track record: 2 sales, both high quality (100%)
   * This reinforces the trustworthiness of Alice's recommendations

The expected value ($1,600,000) is significantly higher than the price ($1,000,000), and Alice's perfect track record along with her recommendation makes this a positive expected value decision.

* Total expected value: $1,600,000

2. Sales record analysis:
* 3 buyers purchased
* 2 high-quality products sold (66.7% success rate)
* The historical rate is lower than the general 80% probability, but with a small sample size

3. Cost vs. Benefit:
* Cost: $1,000,000
* Expected value: $1,600,000
* Potential profit: $600,000

Despite the slightly lower historical success rate, the seller's recommendation and the favorable base probability (80%) make this a positive expected value proposition. The expected value ($1,600,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($1,000,000).

1) Prior probability:
- 80% chance of high quality
- 20% chance of low quality

2) Sale history:
- 5 previous buyers
- 4 high-quality products sold (80% success rate)
- This matches the expected probability distribution

3) Economics:
- Cost: $1,000,000
- Value if high quality: $2,000,000 (profit of $1,000,000)
- Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $1,000,000)

4) Expected value calculation:
With 80% chance of high quality:
0.8 × ($2,000,000 - $1,000,000) + 0.2 × (-$1,000,000) = $600,000

The historical data (83.3% high quality) aligns well with the base probability (80%), and Alice's recommendation is positive.
