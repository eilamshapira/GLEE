Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the statistics provided, Alice has recommended the product to a previous buyer, resulting in one purchase, but that purchase was not a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice may recommend both high-quality and low-quality products. However, since there's only one instance, we don't have enough data to make a fully informed decision. Alice is recommending this product to you, so there is still a 50% chance this product could be high quality, which is worth significantly more than the price.

Given the equal probability of high-quality and low-quality and the possibility of Alice recommending either, buying might still be a worthwhile risk.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the current sales record where 2 products have been sold and 0 high-quality products have been sold, the seller has not yet demonstrated providing high-quality products. Although Alice recommends buying this product, the track record shows a 0% success rate for high-quality products being sold so far. 

Here's the logic:
- Probability of high-quality product based on recommendation = 0 (based on record)
- Value if high quality: $3,000,000
- Value if low quality: $0
- Cost to buy the product: $1,000,000

Expected value = (Probability of high-quality product) × (Value if high quality) + (Probability of low-quality product) × (Value if low quality) - Cost 

In this case, the expected value calculation based on historical data does not suggest a positive outcome.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the statistics that none of the previously sold products were high quality, it's likely that Alice's recommendations may not be entirely reliable. Despite Alice recommending this product, the track record suggests a high risk of it being low quality. Therefore, a cautious approach would be to pass on this purchase to avoid potentially losing $1,000,000.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the statistics provided, Alice has recommended other buyers to buy products which have not been high-quality, given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far out of 2 products sold. This means Alice's recommendation thus far aligns with products of low quality, which might suggest a pattern or bias in Alice's recommendation process.

Considering the value and risk:
- If the product is high-quality, it's worth $3,000,000 to me.
- If the product is low-quality, it's worth $0.
- Given Alice's track record up to this point, and that she recommends purchasing the product, there may be a higher risk that this could be another low-quality product.

Given only 2 products have been sold, and none were high-quality, I would cautiously decide against purchasing.

Therefore, my decision will be:

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information:
- 2 products have been sold and both were low quality since 0 high-quality products have been sold.
- Alice recommends buying the current product.

Buying the current product based solely on Alice's recommendation, when historical data shows a 0% high-quality outcome from her recommendations, is risky. The prior record suggests reliability might be low.
