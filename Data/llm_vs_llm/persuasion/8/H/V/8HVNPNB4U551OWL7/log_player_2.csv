Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no historical data to go by, Alice's recommendation alone provides valuable information. Since she knows the quality of the product, her recommendation to buy suggests it is high quality.  This information outweighs the 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, as a high-quality product nets a profit of $100."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice, who has information about the product's quality, is not recommending the purchase. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.
* **Limited Data:**  We have very limited data.  Only one product has been sold, and it was high quality. This is not enough to establish a reliable pattern.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of a high-quality product ($200) is significant, but the risk of a low-quality product ($0) is also high. Given Alice's recommendation and the limited data, the risk outweighs the reward."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The seller's recommendation is valuable:** Alice knows the true quality of the product and is recommending you buy it. This suggests a high likelihood of the product being high quality.
* **Limited data, but positive:**  While the sample size is small (only one previous buyer), the fact that the only product sold so far was high-quality is a strong positive signal.
* **Potential payoff outweighs risk:** The potential gain of $200 if the product is high-quality outweighs the potential loss of $100 if it's low quality, given the positive signals from the seller and limited data."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

Here's the reasoning:

* **High Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, and her recommendations have been accurate so far (2 high-quality products sold).
* **Limited Data:** While the sample size is small, it suggests a higher than expected proportion of high-quality products.
* **Potential Value:** Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain of $200 from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $100.

Therefore, the decision is to buy the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 3 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 3 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 4th buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The evidence is overwhelmingly positive:** All 3 previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation received high-quality products.
* **Alice's recommendation is valuable:**  Even though the inherent probability of a high-quality product is 80%, Alice's perfect track record strongly suggests she has some ability to discern quality.

While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product at a significant discount ($100 for a $200 value) outweighs the risk in this case."

**Reasoning:**

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is based on her knowledge of the product's quality. Since all 11 previous buyers who purchased based on her recommendation received high-quality products, it's highly likely the current product is also high-quality.  The odds are in your favor, and the potential reward ($200) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product."

{""decision"": ""no""}

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since she has seen all the products and has a perfect track record of recommending only high-quality products, her not recommending this product strongly suggests it is low-quality.  Even though the historical data shows a high percentage of high-quality products, the seller's recommendation outweighs this information in this specific instance."
