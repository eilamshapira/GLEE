Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Prior probability:
- 80% chance of high quality ($4M value)
- 20% chance of low quality ($0 value)
- Price is $1M

2. Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying:
- Given Alice knows the true value to me, not recommending suggests it's likely low quality
- It wouldn't make sense for Alice to discourage me from buying a high-quality product since that would be profitable for both of us

3. Decision:
- Given Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of this being a low-quality product is very high
- If it's low quality, I'd lose $1M
- The risk is too high given the negative recommendation

{""decision"": ""no""}"

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Prior probability of high quality: 80%
2. Price: $1,000,000
3. Value if high quality: $4,000,000
4. Value if low quality: $0
5. Alice doesn't recommend buying
6. No previous sales history to reference

Expected value calculation:
* P(high quality) × Value(high) + P(low quality) × Value(low) - Price

If Alice is truthful in not recommending, this suggests the product might be low quality. However, we don't know Alice's incentives or strategy yet.

Given the base probability of 80% high quality:
0.8 × $4,000,000 + 0.2 × $0 - $1,000,000 = $2,200,000 expected profit

Even with the negative recommendation, the base probabilities make this a positive expected value purchase.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Base probability:
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $4M)
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)
- Price is $1M

2. Additional information:
- Alice doesn't recommend buying
- Previous sale: 1 buyer, 0 high-quality products sold
- This suggests the previous sale was a low-quality product

3. Given that Alice knows the true value and doesn't recommend buying, plus the previous negative outcome, this strongly suggests this product is low quality.

The expected value would be significantly lower than the $1M asking price.

However:
* Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying
* From past sales, 1 buyer purchased but 0 high-quality products were sold
* This suggests the previous sale was a low-quality product
* Alice's negative recommendation likely means this is also a low-quality product

Given Alice's warning and the concerning sales history, it's too risky to purchase.

The fact that Alice doesn't recommend buying and the previous sale resulted in a low-quality product are strong negative signals. While the base probability of high quality is 80%, these signals suggest this particular product is likely low quality.

If the product is low quality (which seems likely given Alice's recommendation), I would lose $1,000,000.
