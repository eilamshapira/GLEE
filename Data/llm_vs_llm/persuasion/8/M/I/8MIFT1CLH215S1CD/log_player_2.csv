"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you have no prior information about the products, it's always beneficial to buy a product recommended by Alice, even if the recommendation is purely random. Here's why:

* **Expected Value:** Even though there's a higher chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($12,500) outweighs the potential loss ($10,000). 
* **Learning:** By buying the product, you gain valuable information about its quality. This information will be helpful in making future decisions."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The information from round 1 gives you a better understanding of Alice's recommendations. Even though the product could be low quality, you know that Alice's recommendation is not entirely useless, and you can expect to make a profit on average.  The same logic from the previous round applies:

* **Expected Value:** The potential gain ($12,500) still outweighs the potential loss ($10,000).
* **Learning:** Buying the product lets you gather more data on Alice's recommendations and the quality of the products."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though you lost money in the previous round, it's still a good idea to buy the product in round 3. Here's why:

* **Limited Information:** Two rounds is not enough to determine a pattern in Alice's recommendations or the quality of the products. 
* **Expected Value:** Despite losing money in round 2, the expected value of buying the product is still positive, due to the potential of getting a high-quality product and making a profit.
* **Learning:** The more data you gather, the better you can understand Alice's recommendations and the likelihood of finding a high-quality product.

Remember, the game is about maximizing your long-term profit, not winning every single round."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The strategy remains the same. Even with two consecutive losses, we lack sufficient data to make any strong conclusions about Alice's recommendations or the overall quality of the products. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **Expected Value:** Despite the losses, the potential gain from a high-quality product still outweighs the potential loss.
* **Learning:**  Every purchase provides more information about Alice's recommendations and the product distribution.
* **Long-Term Perspective:**  It's important to view this as a long-term game. Focusing on maximizing profit over the entire 20 rounds, not just individual rounds.

Even if you lose again, you are still gaining valuable information for future decisions."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While it might seem tempting to change our strategy after four consecutive losses, it's crucial to remember the core principles of this game:

* **Limited Information:**  Five rounds is still a small sample size to draw any meaningful conclusions about Alice's recommendations or the product quality distribution.
* **Expected Value:** The potential gain from a high-quality product ($12,500) is still significant compared to the potential loss ($10,000).
* **Learning:**  We continue to gain valuable insights with each purchase. We need to observe more rounds before potentially adjusting our strategy.

Sticking to the strategy of buying every recommended product allows us to gather the most information possible, which is crucial for making informed decisions in the later rounds."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The pattern of losses might be tempting to change your strategy, but it's important to remember these points:

* **Limited Information:** Six rounds still offer a small sample size to confidently draw conclusions about Alice's recommendations. We lack the information to determine if her recommendations are consistently poor or if we're simply experiencing a streak of bad luck.
* **Expected Value:** While the losses are frustrating, the potential for profit from a high-quality product remains significant.  The potential gain ($12,500) significantly outweighs the potential loss ($10,000).
* **Learning:**  Each purchase provides additional data that helps refine your understanding of Alice's recommendations and the distribution of product qualities.

The strategy of buying every recommended product remains the most effective for maximizing your potential profits over the long term. 

Continue to gather information, analyze the results, and make data-driven decisions."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's understandable to feel hesitant after a streak of losses, but we need to resist the urge to make emotional decisions based on a small sample size. Here's why continuing to buy is still the best strategy:

* **Limited Data:** Seven rounds are still insufficient to make a strong conclusion about Alice's recommendations or the product quality distribution. We need more data to identify patterns or trends.
* **Expected Value:** While the losses have been consistent, the potential profit from a high-quality product ($12,500) remains significantly higher than the potential loss ($10,000).
* **Learning:** Every purchase provides valuable information. By continuing to buy, we gain a deeper understanding of Alice's recommendations and the product quality distribution, enabling better decision-making in future rounds.

Remember, the goal is to maximize long-term profits, and staying consistent with our strategy is crucial for gathering enough data to make informed decisions."

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're facing a difficult situation with eight consecutive losses, but it's critical to maintain a rational and data-driven approach. Here's why:

* **Limited Information:** Even after eight rounds, we have a limited sample size. There's still a chance that Alice's recommendations are not consistently bad, and we're simply experiencing a run of bad luck. 
* **Expected Value:**  The potential gain from a high-quality product ($12,500) continues to outweigh the potential loss ($10,000). This means that statistically, we are expected to make a profit in the long run. 
* **Learning:** We are constantly gathering information about Alice's recommendations and the product quality distribution. This information is crucial for making informed decisions in future rounds. 

Even though the losses are frustrating, it's essential to remember that the goal is long-term profit maximization. By continuing to buy, we are maximizing our chances of gaining the necessary information to eventually make more informed decisions.

It's also important to note that there's no guarantee of success.  The game is based on chance, and even with the best strategy, losses are possible. The key is to remain disciplined and stick to a rational approach."

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Finally, a win!  However, it's crucial to resist letting this single win influence our strategy.  Here's why we should continue buying:

* **Limited Information:** Even with one win, nine rounds are still a small sample size. We need more data to make informed decisions about Alice's recommendations.
* **Expected Value:**  While the previous win feels good, it's important to remember that the expected value of buying is still positive.  The potential gain from a high-quality product ($12,500) outweighs the potential loss ($10,000).
* **Learning:** Each round provides valuable information. By continuing to buy, we gain a better understanding of Alice's recommendations and the product quality distribution. 

We are in a better position now, having seen a high-quality product after many losses. However, we should avoid jumping to conclusions and making emotional decisions.  Sticking to our strategy of buying every recommended product ensures we gather the maximum amount of information to make the most informed decisions later in the game."

Round 10
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Despite the recent win followed by another loss, our strategy remains unchanged. Here's why:

* **Limited Information:** Ten rounds, even with a win, are still not enough data to make conclusive judgments about Alice's recommendations. We need more data to identify any patterns or trends in her recommendations.
* **Expected Value:** While the recent loss is frustrating, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($12,500) continues to outweigh the potential loss ($10,000).
* **Learning:**  Each purchase provides us with more information about Alice's recommendations and the product quality distribution. 

It's crucial to remember that this is a long-term game. By focusing on maximizing our profits over the entire 20 rounds, we can make more informed decisions as we gather more information. Even though losses are frustrating, sticking to our strategy allows us to gather the data needed to make better decisions in the future."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even with another loss, the core principles of the game remain the same. Here's why we should continue buying:

* **Limited Information:** 11 rounds, while significant, are still insufficient to make confident conclusions about Alice's recommendations or the overall product quality distribution.
