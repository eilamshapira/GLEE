"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

- A high-quality product costs $100 and is worth $300 to me (profit of $200)
- A low-quality product costs $100 and is worth $0 to me (loss of $100)
- Products have 50% chance of being high or low quality
- Alice knows the true quality

Since this is round 1, I don't yet know if Alice's recommendations are trustworthy. If Alice is honest, her recommendation to buy suggests the product is high quality. However, Alice could potentially benefit by recommending low-quality products too.

Given that a high-quality product gives me a profit of $200 and a low-quality product gives me a loss of $100, the expected value of buying a random product is positive (0.5 × $200 - 0.5 × $100 = $50). So even without knowing Alice's trustworthiness, buying is statistically favorable.
