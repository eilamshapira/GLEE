"Round 1
Alice's message: Bob, this product has a 50% chance of being high-quality. It's a great deal at $100!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this rationally:

- Cost of product: $100
- Value if high quality (50% chance): $300
- Value if low quality (50% chance): $0

Expected value = (0.5 × $300) + (0.5 × $0) = $150

Since the expected value ($150) is greater than the cost ($100), it's mathematically favorable to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: Bob, you got a low-quality item last time. This time, you might get lucky with a high-quality one! It's still a 50% chance and the price remains $100.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The previous outcome doesn't affect the current probability - each round is independent.

Let me analyze again:
- Cost of product: $100
- Value if high quality (50% chance): $300
- Value if low quality (50% chance): $0

Expected value = (0.5 × $300) + (0.5 × $0) = $150

The expected value ($150) still exceeds the cost ($100), so it's still mathematically advantageous to buy, regardless of the previous outcome.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $300 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: Bob, you've had a mix of luck so far. Remember, it's always a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product. Want to try your luck again for $100?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze again:

- Cost of product: $100
- Value if high quality (50% chance): $300
- Value if low quality (50% chance): $0

Expected value = (0.5 × $300) + (0.5 × $0) = $150

The previous outcomes (one low, one high) confirm the random nature of the quality, but don't affect the current probability. The expected value ($150) continues to be greater than the cost ($100), so it remains a mathematically profitable decision to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: Bob, here's another opportunity! You've seen how it can go either way. Maybe this time you'll get lucky with a high-quality product. It's a 50% chance at $100.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze once more:

- Cost of product: $100
- Value if high quality (50% chance): $300
- Value if low quality (50% chance): $0

Expected value = (0.5 × $300) + (0.5 × $0) = $150

Despite getting two low-quality products and one high-quality product so far, each new round is independent. The expected value ($150) is still higher than the cost ($100), making it mathematically advantageous to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $300 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: Bob, you're on a roll! Remember, each round is a fresh start with a 50% chance of being high-quality. Want to try again for $100?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze again:

- Cost of product: $100
- Value if high quality (50% chance): $300
- Value if low quality (50% chance): $0

Expected value = (0.5 × $300) + (0.5 × $0) = $150

Whether I've won or lost in previous rounds doesn't affect this round's probability. Each round remains independent with a 50% chance. Since the expected value ($150) is still greater than the cost ($100), it remains rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: Bob, you're doing great! Each round is a new opportunity with a 50% chance of high-quality. Keep it going for $100?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze again:

- Cost of product: $100
- Value if high quality (50% chance): $300
- Value if low quality (50% chance): $0

Expected value = (0.5 × $300) + (0.5 × $0) = $150

So far I've had 3 low-quality and 2 high-quality products, but each round remains independent with a 50% chance. The expected value ($150) still exceeds the cost ($100), so the rational decision is to continue buying.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $300 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: Bob, don't be disheartened by the previous outcomes. It's always a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product. Want to take the chance for $100?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze again:

- Cost of product: $100
- Value if high quality (50% chance): $300
- Value if low quality (50% chance): $0

Expected value = (0.5 × $300) + (0.5 × $0) = $150

I've now had 3 each of high and low-quality products, which is close to the expected 50/50 split. However, this new round is still independent with the same probabilities. Since the expected value ($150) remains higher than the cost ($100), it's still rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice's message: Bob, remember that each round is independent of the previous ones. You always have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product. Want to give it another shot for $100?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze again:

- Cost of product: $100
- Value if high quality (50% chance): $300
- Value if low quality (50% chance): $0

Expected value = (0.5 × $300) + (0.5 × $0) = $150

I've now had 4 low-quality and 3 high-quality products, but this doesn't affect the probability for this round. Each round remains independent with a 50% chance. Since the expected value ($150) is still greater than the cost ($100), it remains mathematically advantageous to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice's message: Bob, your persistence might pay off this time! It's a fresh 50% chance of getting a high-quality product. Want to try for $100?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze again:

- Cost of product: $100
- Value if high quality (50% chance): $300
- Value if low quality (50% chance): $0

Expected value = (0.5 × $300) + (0.5 × $0) = $150

Despite having received 5 low-quality and 3 high-quality products so far, the probability remains 50/50 for this new round. Each round is independent of previous outcomes. Since the expected value ($150) continues to exceed the cost ($100), the rational decision is still to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $300 for you.

Round 10
Alice's message: Bob, you know the drill! It's always a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product. Want to take another chance for $100?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze again:

- Cost of product: $100
- Value if high quality (50% chance): $300
- Value if low quality (50% chance): $0

Expected value = (0.5 × $300) + (0.5 × $0) = $150

We're halfway through the game now, with 5 low-quality and 4 high-quality products received. However, this round remains independent with the same 50/50 probability. Since the expected value ($150) is still greater than the cost ($100), it continues to be mathematically advantageous to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 11
Alice's message: Bob, you're doing amazing! Keep in mind that it's always a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product. Ready to try again for $100?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze again:

- Cost of product: $100
- Value if high quality (50% chance): $300
- Value if low quality (50% chance): $0

Expected value = (0.5 × $300) + (0.5 × $0) = $150

I've now had 6 low-quality and 4 high-quality products, but this has no bearing on the current round's probability. Each round remains independent with a 50% chance. Since the expected value ($150) is still higher than the cost ($100), it remains rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $300 for you.

Round 12
Alice's message: Bob, don't let the past outcomes influence your decision. It's a new round with a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product. Want to try your luck for $100?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze again:

- Cost of product: $100
- Value if high quality (50% chance): $300
- Value if low quality (50% chance): $0

Expected value = (0.5 × $300) + (0.5 × $0) = $150

I've now had 6 low-quality and 5 high-quality products, which is fairly close to the expected distribution. However, this new round remains independent with the same 50/50 probability. Since the expected value ($150) continues to exceed the cost ($100), it's still mathematically advantageous to buy.
