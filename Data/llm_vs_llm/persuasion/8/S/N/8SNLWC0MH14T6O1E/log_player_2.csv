Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 
   - 50% chance of $400 (high quality)
   - 50% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $400) + (0.5 × $0) = $200
4. Alice recommends buying
5. No prior sales history to verify Alice's trustworthiness

Since the expected value ($200) is greater than the price ($100), and even though we don't have previous sales data to verify Alice's reliability, the potential return makes this a positive expected value decision.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The recommended product costs $100
2. If high quality, I gain $400 (net profit $300)
3. If low quality, I gain $0 (net loss $100)
4. Previous statistics:
   - 1 buyer before me
   - 1 purchase made
   - 0 high-quality products sold
   - This means the previous buyer bought a low-quality product

The fact that the previous buyer purchased but got a low-quality product, combined with Alice recommending me to buy, raises concerns about the reliability of Alice's recommendations. The previous outcome suggests Alice might be making recommendations regardless of quality.

Given the evidence of potentially unreliable recommendations and a confirmed previous low-quality sale, it would be risky to trust the recommendation.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality: $400 (50% chance)
   - Low quality: $0 (50% chance)
3. Historical data:
   - 1 previous buyer purchased
   - 0 high-quality products sold
   - This suggests the previous sale was a low-quality product
4. Alice recommends buying

Even though Alice recommends buying, the historical data is concerning because the only previous sale was apparently a low-quality product. However, with a 50-50 chance, the expected value calculation is:

(0.5 × $400) + (0.5 × $0) = $200

Since the expected value ($200) is still greater than the price ($100), and each product's quality is independent of previous ones, it's still rational to buy.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price = $100
2. Potential value: 50% chance of $400 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $400) + (0.5 × $0) = $200
4. Previous sales data:
   - 2 buyers purchased
   - 0 high-quality products sold
   - This means both previous sales were low-quality products

The concerning factor is that both previous sales were low-quality products, which raises questions about Alice's recommendations. Despite Alice recommending to buy, the track record shows no high-quality products sold yet.

Given that the true probability should be 50/50, but we've seen 0/2 high-quality products, this suggests Alice's recommendations might not be reliable. The risk is too high.

3. Prior sales:

This is concerning because:
1. Alice has recommended products before that turned out to be low quality
2. 100% of previous sales were low-quality products
3. Even though Alice is recommending this product, her previous recommendations led to losses for buyers

Given the negative track record and that previous buyers lost money following Alice's recommendations, I wouldn't trust the current recommendation.
