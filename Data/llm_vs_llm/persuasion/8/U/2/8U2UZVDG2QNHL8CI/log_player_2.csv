Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Value: $125 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
3. Probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
4. Expected value = (0.8 × $125) + (0.2 × $0) = $100

Given that:
- The expected value equals the price ($100)
- Alice has recommended buying the product
- There's no historical data to provide additional context
- Alice knows the true value and has chosen to recommend it

Alice's recommendation adds some positive weight to the decision, making it slightly more favorable than the base probabilities suggest.

1. Price = $100
2. Expected value calculation:
   * 80% chance of high quality (worth $125)
   * 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)
   * Expected value = (0.8 × $125) + (0.2 × $0) = $100

   * Previous buyer bought and received a high-quality product
   * Alice is recommending to buy
   * Alice knows the true quality and value

The fact that the previous sale was successful with a high-quality product and Alice is recommending to buy are positive signals. The expected value equals the price, and with the positive signals, this seems like a reasonable purchase.

   * Success rate = 5/6 (83.3%)
3. Alice has recommended to buy
4. Expected value calculation:
   * If high quality (80% chance): $125 - $100 = $25 profit
   * If low quality (20% chance): $0 - $100 = -$100 loss
   * Expected value = (0.8 × $25) + (0.2 × -$100) = $0

- Price: $100
- Potential value: $125 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Base probability: 80% high quality
- Alice's recommendation is positive
