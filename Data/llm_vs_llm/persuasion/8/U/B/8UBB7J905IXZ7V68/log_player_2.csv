Let's calculate the expected value of buying a product:

- There's an 80% chance that the product is high-quality, in which case you gain $30,000 - $10,000 = $20,000.
- There's a 20% chance that the product is low-quality, in which case you gain $0 - $10,000 = -$10,000.

The expected value of buying a product is:

0.8 * $20,000 + 0.2 * (-$10,000) = $16,000 - $2,000 = $14,000

Since the expected value of $14,000 is greater than the cost of $10,000, it makes sense to always buy the product."
