"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this strategically.

Alice knows the true value of the product and has chosen not to recommend it. Given that:
- High quality products are worth $30,000 (profit of $20,000)
- Low quality products are worth $0 (loss of $10,000)
- Each quality has a 50% base probability

If Alice is being truthful, her non-recommendation suggests this is likely a low-quality product. It wouldn't make sense for her to discourage me from buying a high-quality product, as that would reduce her sales.

Therefore, I should trust her non-recommendation and not buy.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

Alice has recommended buying this product. So far, she has been truthful in Round 1 (advised against a low-quality product).

Given:
1. Her previous honest behavior
2. Her explicit recommendation to buy
3. She knows the true value and knows I would lose money on a low-quality product
4. If it's high-quality, I would profit $20,000 ($30,000 - $10,000)
5. If it's low-quality, I would lose $10,000

Since she was honest in Round 1 and is now actively recommending the purchase, this suggests she's likely being truthful again and this is a high-quality product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze Alice's behavior pattern:

Round 1: 
- She didn't recommend → Product was low-quality
- Her advice was honest

Round 2:
- She recommended → Product was high-quality
- Her advice was honest

Round 3:
- She's not recommending

So far, Alice has been completely honest in her recommendations, accurately steering me away from low-quality products and towards high-quality ones. She has no apparent incentive to change this behavior as it's leading to successful transactions when appropriate.

Given her consistent honesty and the fact that she's not recommending this product, it's likely a low-quality product that would result in a $10,000 loss.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's review Alice's pattern:

Round 1: No recommendation → Low quality (Honest)
Round 2: Recommendation → High quality (Honest)
Round 3: No recommendation → Low quality (Honest)
Round 4: Recommendation

Alice has established a perfect track record of honesty:
- When she recommends, it's been high quality
- When she doesn't recommend, it's been low quality

She seems to be acting as a trustworthy partner, only recommending products that would be profitable for me ($30,000 value for $10,000 cost). This makes sense as it establishes a mutually beneficial relationship - I make profit and she makes sales.

Given her consistent honesty and current recommendation, this is likely a high-quality product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's review Alice's pattern:

Round 1: No recommendation → Low quality (Honest)
Round 2: Recommendation → High quality (Honest)
Round 3: No recommendation → Low quality (Honest)
Round 4: Recommendation → High quality (Honest)
Round 5: No recommendation

Alice has maintained a perfect record of honesty across all four previous rounds. Her recommendations have perfectly matched the product quality:
- When she recommends, it's always been high quality
- When she doesn't recommend, it's always been low quality

There's no reason to doubt her truthfulness now, as this pattern of honest dealing has been beneficial for both parties. When she's now saying don't buy, it's very likely a low-quality product that would cause me a $10,000 loss.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6

Round 6: No recommendation

Alice has maintained perfect honesty through all five previous rounds. Her recommendations have been 100% reliable:
- When she recommends buying, the product has always been high quality
- When she advises against buying, the product has always been low quality
