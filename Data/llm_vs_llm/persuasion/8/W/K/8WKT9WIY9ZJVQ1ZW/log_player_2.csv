"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this game:

- Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality
- High quality is worth $3,000,000 to me, low quality is worth $0
- I pay $1,000,000 per product regardless of quality
- Alice knows the true quality and gives recommendations

For a rational decision, I need to calculate the expected value:
- If I buy: 50% chance of $3,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $2,000,000 profit, and 50% chance of $0 - $1,000,000 = -$1,000,000 loss
- Expected value: 0.5 × $2,000,000 + 0.5 × (-$1,000,000) = $500,000

Since Alice is recommending I buy, and this is just the first round, I don't have enough information yet about her recommendation patterns. The base expected value is positive, so I'll buy.
