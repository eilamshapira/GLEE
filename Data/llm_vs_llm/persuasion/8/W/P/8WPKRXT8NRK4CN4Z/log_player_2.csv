"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Price: $100
2. If high quality (80% chance): Worth $200 (profit of $100)
3. If low quality (20% chance): Worth $0 (loss of $100)

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of $100 profit = $80
- 20% chance of $100 loss = -$20
Net expected value = $60

Since Alice knows the true quality and recommends buying, and the expected value is positive, it's rational to trust her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The previous round was successful - Alice was honest in her recommendation and I made a profit of $100.

The same calculation still applies:
1. Price: $100
2. If high quality (80% chance): Worth $200 (profit of $100)
3. If low quality (20% chance): Worth $0 (loss of $100)

Expected value is still $60, and Alice has shown herself to be trustworthy in the first round. Her recommendation aligns with the positive expected value.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has been honest in both previous rounds, recommending high-quality products that resulted in profits. This builds trust in her recommendations.

The fundamental economics remain the same:
1. Price: $100
2. If high quality (80% chance): Worth $200 (profit of $100)
3. If low quality (20% chance): Worth $0 (loss of $100)

Expected value is still $60, and Alice's track record of honest recommendations strengthens the case for buying.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has maintained a perfect track record so far, with three honest recommendations leading to profitable purchases. 

The base economics remain unchanged:
1. Price: $100
2. If high quality (80% chance): Worth $200 (profit of $100)
3. If low quality (20% chance): Worth $0 (loss of $100)

Expected value is $60, and Alice's consistent honesty suggests she's maintaining a reputation for trustworthy recommendations. There's no reason to deviate from trusting her at this point.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has now given five straight honest recommendations, all leading to profitable purchases. Her perfect track record continues to build trust.

The same economic factors apply:
1. Price: $100
2. If high quality (80% chance): Worth $200 (profit of $100)
3. If low quality (20% chance): Worth $0 (loss of $100)

Expected value remains $60, and Alice's consistent honesty suggests she's playing a long-term strategy of maintaining trustworthy recommendations. There's still no reason to doubt her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has demonstrated perfect honesty through five rounds, each recommendation leading to a profitable high-quality product. This suggests she's committed to maintaining a trustworthy relationship.

The economics remain constant:
1. Price: $100
2. If high quality (80% chance): Worth $200 (profit of $100)
3. If low quality (20% chance): Worth $0 (loss of $100)

Expected value is still $60, and Alice's consistent track record of honest recommendations makes it rational to continue trusting her advice.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has maintained a perfect record through six rounds, consistently recommending high-quality products that resulted in profits. This level of consistency is remarkable.

The basic economics haven't changed:
1. Price: $100
2. If high quality (80% chance): Worth $200 (profit of $100)
3. If low quality (20% chance): Worth $0 (loss of $100)

Expected value remains $60, and Alice's perfect track record of honest recommendations suggests she's committed to maintaining trust. While we should stay alert for any changes in pattern, there's currently no reason to doubt her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has now given seven consecutive honest recommendations, each resulting in a profitable purchase. This perfect track record continues to reinforce trust.

The economic fundamentals remain:
1. Price: $100
2. If high quality (80% chance): Worth $200 (profit of $100)
3. If low quality (20% chance): Worth $0 (loss of $100)

Expected value is still $60, and Alice's consistent pattern of honest recommendations suggests she's committed to maintaining a trustworthy relationship. While we should remain vigilant, her recommendations have proven reliable.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 9
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is an interesting change - for the first time, Alice is NOT recommending the purchase. Given that:

1. Alice has been perfectly honest for 8 rounds, building trust
2. She knows the true quality of the product
3. She has incentive to sell (she gets $100 regardless of quality)
4. Despite this, she's choosing NOT to recommend

This strongly suggests that this product is low quality, and she's maintaining her honest reputation by warning me away from a bad purchase.

If she's being honest (which her track record suggests), this is likely a low-quality product worth $0, which would result in a $100 loss.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 10
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice proved honest again in round 9, warning me away from a low-quality product. This further reinforces her trustworthiness.

She's again choosing NOT to recommend the purchase, despite that:
1. She would get $100 from a sale regardless of quality
2. She has maintained a perfect record of honest recommendations
3. She knows the true quality

Given her proven track record of honesty (now 9 for 9), it's very likely this is another low-quality product that she's ethically warning me to avoid. If I bought it, I would likely lose $100.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has now proven honest in all 10 previous rounds - recommending high-quality products (rounds 1-8) and warning against low-quality ones (rounds 9-10). This is a remarkable demonstration of trustworthiness.

She's now back to recommending a purchase. Given:
1. Her perfect track record of honesty
2. The basic economics ($100 cost, $200 value if high quality, $0 if low)
3. Her knowledge of true quality
4. Her demonstrated willingness to warn against bad products

It's highly likely this is back to being a high-quality product worth $200.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 12
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to demonstrate perfect honesty through 11 rounds - accurately recommending high-quality products and warning against low-quality ones. Her track record shows she's committed to maintaining honest recommendations.

The economics remain constant:
1. Price: $100
2. If high quality: Worth $200 (profit of $100)
3. If low quality: Worth $0 (loss of $100)

Given her proven reliability in both recommending good products and warning against bad ones, there's strong reason to trust her current recommendation.

The economic fundamentals haven't changed:
1. Price: $100
2. If high quality: Worth $200 (profit of $100)
3. If low quality: Worth $0 (loss of $100)

Given her consistent track record and her demonstrated willingness to warn against low-quality products when they appear, there's strong reason to continue trusting her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 14
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has maintained a perfect record of honesty through 13 rounds, including both positive recommendations for high-quality products and warnings against low-quality ones.

Round 16
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has maintained perfect honesty for 15 rounds, and is now again warning against a purchase. Her previous warnings (rounds 9-10) proved accurate about low-quality products.

Given that:
1. She has been completely honest in all previous rounds
2. She's choosing NOT to recommend despite getting $100 from any sale
3. She knows the true quality
4. Her previous warnings accurately identified low-quality products

This strongly suggests this is another low-quality product that would result in a $100 loss. Her consistent honesty and willingness to warn against bad products makes this warning highly credible.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

1. Her unbroken record of truthful recommendations
2. The standard economics ($100 cost, $200 if high quality, $0 if low)
3. Her demonstrated willingness to warn against bad products
4. Her return to a positive recommendation

This strongly suggests we're back to a high-quality product that will be worth $200. Her consistent pattern of honest behavior makes her recommendation highly reliable.

1. Price: $100
2. If high quality: Worth $200 (profit of $100)
3. If low quality: Worth $0 (loss of $100)

Given her unwavering commitment to honest recommendations, including sacrificing potential sales by warning against low-quality products, there's every reason to continue trusting her current recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 19
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

The economics remain constant:
1. Price: $100
2. If high quality: Worth $200 (profit of $100)
3. If low quality: Worth $0 (loss of $100)

With only two rounds remaining in the game, there's no reason to expect her to suddenly change her strategy of honest recommendations. Her track record and the continued positive recommendation strongly suggest this is another high-quality product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 20

1. She's built a perfect record of honest recommendations
2. She's demonstrated integrity by warning against low-quality products when they appeared
3. The economics remain the same ($100 cost, $200 if high quality, $0 if low)
4. Even in this final round, maintaining her honest reputation likely matters to her

While one might theoretically worry about end-game effects, her consistent ethical behavior suggests she values honesty intrinsically, not just instrumentally for future interactions.
