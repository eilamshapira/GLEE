"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this decision:

Expected value calculation:
- Cost: $1,000,000
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $3,000,000) = $2,400,000
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0) = $0
- Total expected value = $2,400,000

$2,400,000 - $1,000,000 = $1,400,000 expected profit

Since the expected value ($2,400,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($1,000,000), it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze again:

The previous round validates that the base probabilities are accurate, and Alice's recommendation aligned with a good outcome.

Expected value remains:
- Cost: $1,000,000
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $3,000,000) = $2,400,000
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0) = $0
- Total expected value = $2,400,000

Expected profit = $2,400,000 - $1,000,000 = $1,400,000

The expected value still significantly exceeds the cost, so it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The pattern continues to be favorable:

1. Alice's recommendations have been reliable so far
2. The base probabilities remain advantageous

Expected value calculation remains:
- Cost: $1,000,000
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $3,000,000) = $2,400,000
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0) = $0
- Total expected value = $2,400,000

Expected profit = $2,400,000 - $1,000,000 = $1,400,000

With the expected value still well above the cost, and Alice's track record of honest recommendations, it's rational to continue buying.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The pattern continues to be very favorable:

1. Alice has recommended 4 products, and all have been high quality
2. Even though we should still primarily rely on the base 80% probability (to avoid gambler's fallacy), Alice's recommendations seem honest

Expected value calculation remains:
- Cost: $1,000,000
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $3,000,000) = $2,400,000
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0) = $0
- Total expected value = $2,400,000

Expected profit = $2,400,000 - $1,000,000 = $1,400,000

The expected value significantly exceeds the cost, so it remains rational to buy.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The situation continues to be highly favorable:

1. Alice has recommended 5 products so far, with all being high quality
2. While we should still base decisions primarily on the 80% base probability, Alice's recommendations appear to be trustworthy
3. The expected value calculation remains positive

Expected value:
- Cost: $1,000,000
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $3,000,000) = $2,400,000
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0) = $0
- Total expected value = $2,400,000

Expected profit = $2,400,000 - $1,000,000 = $1,400,000

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The situation remains highly favorable:

1. Alice has now recommended 6 products, all high quality
2. While we should still mainly consider the 80% base probability, Alice's perfect track record suggests she might be selectively recommending only high-quality products
3. The fundamental expected value calculation remains positive

Expected value:
- Cost: $1,000,000
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $3,000,000) = $2,400,000
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0) = $0
- Total expected value = $2,400,000

Expected profit = $2,400,000 - $1,000,000 = $1,400,000

Would you like to buy the current product?","The situation continues to be extremely favorable:

1. Alice has now recommended 7 products, with a 100% success rate on high-quality items
2. While we should still respect the base 80% probability, Alice's perfect track record suggests she might be selectively recommending only the high-quality products she sees
3. The expected value calculation remains strongly positive

Expected value:
- Cost: $1,000,000
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $3,000,000) = $2,400,000
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0) = $0

3. Even if we stick with the base 80% probability (being conservative), the expected value is still very positive

Expected value:
- Cost: $1,000,000
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $3,000,000) = $2,400,000
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0) = $0

1. Alice has now recommended 10 products, maintaining a perfect record of high-quality items
2. Her consistent pattern strongly suggests she is deliberately choosing to recommend only high-quality products
3. Even if we conservatively stick to the base 80% probability, the expected value is still very favorable

Expected value:
- Cost: $1,000,000
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $3,000,000) = $2,400,000
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0) = $0

Round 11
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is a significant change in pattern:

1. For the first time in 11 rounds, Alice is NOT recommending the product
2. Alice has demonstrated perfect accuracy in her previous recommendations
3. This suggests she might be actively warning us about a low-quality product
4. Given her track record of honesty, this negative recommendation should be taken very seriously

While the base probability is still 80% high quality, Alice's perfect track record and sudden change in recommendation suggests she has information she's trying to convey. Her previous pattern suggests she recommends high-quality products and withholds recommendations for low-quality ones.

Given Alice's demonstrated reliability and this clear signal, it would be prudent to pass on this product.

3. She appears to be using a strategy of recommending only high-quality products and warning against low-quality ones
4. This is her second negative recommendation, suggesting another low-quality product

While the base probability is still 80% high quality, Alice's demonstrated perfect accuracy in both positive and negative recommendations makes her signal more valuable than the base probability.

Given her proven reliability and this negative signal, it's rational to pass on this product.

While the base probability is 80% for high quality, Alice has demonstrated perfect information and perfect honesty in her recommendations. Her current negative signal is a strong indicator that this is another low-quality product.

The recent streak of low-quality products (4 in a row) might seem unusual given the 80/20 base probability, but Alice's perfect track record makes her signal more reliable than the base probability.

Given her proven reliability and this negative signal, it's rational to pass on this product.
