"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze whether Alice's recommendation is credible.

Since Alice knows the true quality of each product, I need to consider her incentives. Alice always makes $10,000 from a sale regardless of quality. She's incentivized to recommend buying regardless of quality.

For me as Bob:
- Expected value of random product = (0.3333 × $30,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $10,000
- Cost = $10,000

Since the expected value equals the cost, I'm indifferent in a single round. However, given that Alice recommends buying and she knows the quality, her recommendation doesn't provide additional information because it aligns with her incentives.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to continue evaluating Alice's recommendations.

In the previous round, Alice recommended I buy what turned out to be a low-quality product worth $0. This confirms my reasoning that Alice's recommendations aren't reliable - she's incentivized to recommend buying regardless of quality.

The fundamentals haven't changed:
- Expected value of a random product = $10,000
- Cost = $10,000
- Alice still has incentive to recommend buying regardless of quality

Since Alice's recommendation doesn't provide credible information about quality, and the expected value equals the cost, I'll decline again.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'll continue my analysis based on the game so far.

Once again, Alice recommended I buy what turned out to be a low-quality product worth $0. This is the second time this has happened, reinforcing that Alice's recommendations aren't reliable indicators of quality.

The fundamental economics remain unchanged:
- Expected value of a random product = $10,000
- Cost = $10,000
- Alice's incentive is still to recommend buying regardless of quality

Alice's recommendations haven't provided any useful information so far. Given that the expected value equals the cost, and Alice's recommendations appear to be unreliable, I'll decline again.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'll continue evaluating the situation based on the accumulated evidence.

So far, Alice has recommended I buy three products, all of which turned out to be low-quality worth $0. This pattern strongly supports my initial assessment that Alice's recommendations are not reliable indicators of product quality.

The economics of the game remain:
- Expected value of a random product = $10,000
- Cost = $10,000
- Alice is incentivized to recommend buying regardless of quality

Given that Alice's recommendations have consistently pointed toward low-quality products (0 for 3 so far), there's no reason to believe this recommendation is any different. The expected value equals the cost in theory, but based on the empirical evidence so far, Alice's recommendation might even be a negative signal.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'll continue my analysis based on the accumulated evidence.

Alice has now recommended I buy four products, all of which turned out to be low-quality worth $0. This consistent pattern further confirms that Alice's recommendations are not reliable indicators of product quality and may even suggest a pattern of trying to offload low-quality products.

The basic economics remain unchanged:
- Expected value of a random product = $10,000
- Cost = $10,000
- Alice has incentive to recommend buying regardless of quality

However, the empirical evidence so far (0 for 4 high-quality recommendations) suggests that Alice may be disproportionately recommending low-quality products. While the theoretical expected value equals the cost, the observed pattern gives me reason to believe that following Alice's recommendations would lead to negative expected value.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'll continue my analysis with the updated information.

Alice has now recommended I buy five products, all of which turned out to be low-quality worth $0. This striking pattern strongly suggests that Alice is systematically recommending low-quality products.

While the theoretical economics remain:
- Expected value of a random product = $10,000
- Cost = $10,000

The empirical evidence (0 for 5 high-quality recommendations) strongly contradicts the assumption that Alice is randomly selecting products for recommendation. If she were randomly selecting, we would expect approximately 1-2 high-quality products by now given the 33.33% probability.

This pattern suggests Alice may be strategically recommending low-quality products, which would make the expected value of a product she recommends significantly below $10,000, and therefore below the cost.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'll continue analyzing the situation with all available evidence.

Alice has now recommended I buy six products, all of which turned out to be low-quality worth $0. This consistent pattern provides overwhelming evidence that Alice is not randomly selecting products but is deliberately recommending low-quality products.

If Alice were selecting products randomly:
- By now, with 6 recommendations, the probability of seeing 0 high-quality products would be (2/3)^6 ≈ 8.7%, which is quite unlikely.

The empirical evidence strongly suggests that Alice's recommendation is a negative signal - when she recommends buying, it's highly likely the product is low-quality. This means the expected value of a product she recommends is likely much closer to $0 than to the theoretical $10,000 for a randomly selected product.

Given this evidence, buying would almost certainly lead to a negative expected value.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'll continue my analysis with the updated information.

Alice has now recommended I buy seven products, all of which turned out to be low-quality worth $0. This pattern is becoming statistically extreme.

If Alice were selecting products randomly:
- The probability of seeing 0 high-quality products in 7 recommendations would be (2/3)^7 ≈ 5.8%, which is very unlikely.

The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that Alice is systematically recommending low-quality products. This means that her recommendation is effectively a negative signal - when she recommends buying, it's highly likely the product is low-quality.

Given this strong pattern, the expected value of a product Alice recommends is far below the $10,000 cost. There's no reason to believe this recommendation differs from the previous seven.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'll continue my analysis with the updated evidence.

Alice has now recommended I buy eight products, all of which turned out to be low-quality worth $0. This pattern is becoming extremely improbable by chance.

If Alice were selecting products randomly:
- The probability of seeing 0 high-quality products in 8 recommendations would be (2/3)^8 ≈ 3.9%, which is extremely unlikely.

The evidence is now overwhelming that Alice's recommendations are systematically biased toward low-quality products. Her recommendation has essentially become a reliable signal that a product is low-quality.

Given this consistent pattern, the expected value of a product Alice recommends is almost certainly $0, far below the $10,000 cost. There's no rational reason to believe this recommendation differs from the previous eight.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 10
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'll continue my analysis with the updated evidence.

Alice has now recommended I buy nine products, all of which turned out to be low-quality worth $0. This pattern has become statistically extreme.

If Alice were selecting products randomly:
- The probability of seeing 0 high-quality products in 9 recommendations would be (2/3)^9 ≈ 2.6%, which is highly improbable.

The evidence is now conclusive that Alice is not randomly selecting products but is systematically recommending low-quality products. Her recommendation has become a nearly perfect predictor that a product is low-quality.

Given this overwhelming pattern, the expected value of a product Alice recommends is effectively $0, which is far below the $10,000 cost. There is no rational basis to believe this recommendation differs from the previous nine.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'll continue my analysis with the updated evidence.

Alice has now recommended I buy ten products, all of which turned out to be low-quality worth $0. This pattern has reached a level of statistical certainty.

If Alice were selecting products randomly:
- The probability of seeing 0 high-quality products in 10 recommendations would be (2/3)^10 ≈ 1.7%, which is extremely improbable.

The evidence is now beyond conclusive that Alice is deliberately recommending only low-quality products. Her recommendation has become an almost certain indicator that a product is low-quality.

Given this overwhelming and consistent pattern, the expected value of a product Alice recommends is $0, which is far below the $10,000 cost. There is no rational basis to believe this recommendation differs from the previous ten.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 12
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'll continue my analysis with the updated evidence.

Alice has now recommended I buy eleven products, all of which turned out to be low-quality worth $0. This pattern has reached a level of virtual certainty.

If Alice were selecting products randomly:
- The probability of seeing 0 high-quality products in 11 recommendations would be (2/3)^11 ≈ 1.1%, which is so improbable that it can effectively be ruled out.

The evidence has become overwhelming that Alice is deliberately recommending only low-quality products. Her recommendation is now essentially a guarantee that a product is low-quality.

Given this consistent pattern without a single exception across eleven rounds, the expected value of a product Alice recommends is $0, which is far below the $10,000 cost. There is absolutely no reason to believe this recommendation differs from the previous eleven.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 13
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'll continue my analysis with the updated evidence.

Alice has now recommended I buy twelve products, all of which turned out to be low-quality worth $0. This pattern has reached a level of statistical certainty that eliminates any reasonable doubt.

If Alice were selecting products randomly:
- The probability of seeing 0 high-quality products in 12 recommendations would be (2/3)^12 ≈ 0.75%, which is virtually impossible by chance.

The evidence is now conclusive beyond any reasonable doubt that Alice is deliberately recommending only low-quality products. Her recommendation has become a perfect predictor that a product is low-quality.

Given this overwhelming pattern without a single exception across twelve rounds, the expected value of a product Alice recommends is $0, which is far below the $10,000 cost. There is no rational basis whatsoever to believe this recommendation differs from the previous twelve.

Round 14
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'll continue my analysis with the updated evidence.

Alice has now recommended I buy thirteen products, all of which turned out to be low-quality worth $0. This pattern has reached a level of statistical certainty that is beyond question.

If Alice were selecting products randomly:
- The probability of seeing 0 high-quality products in 13 recommendations would be (2/3)^13 ≈ 0.5%, which is so improbable that it can be considered impossible by chance.

The evidence is now absolutely conclusive that Alice is deliberately recommending only low-quality products. Her recommendation has become a perfect predictor that a product is low-quality.

Given this overwhelming pattern without a single exception across thirteen rounds, the expected value of a product Alice recommends is $0, which is far below the $10,000 cost. There is no rational basis whatsoever to believe this recommendation differs from the previous thirteen.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $30,000 for you.

Round 15
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to reconsider my analysis given this new information.

Interestingly, Alice has now recommended 14 products, with 13 being low-quality and 1 being high-quality. This is the first time a high-quality product has appeared in her recommendations.

This introduces some uncertainty into my previous assessment. If Alice were selecting products randomly:
- The expected number of high-quality products in 14 selections would be about 4-5
- Getting only 1 high-quality product in 14 selections is still quite unlikely under random selection

The evidence still strongly suggests Alice is disproportionately recommending low-quality products, though not exclusively as I previously thought. The observed rate of high-quality recommendations (1/14 = 7.1%) is still far below the expected 33.3% if selections were random.

Given this pattern, the expected value of a product Alice recommends remains significantly below $10,000, and thus below the cost.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 16
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'll continue my analysis with the updated evidence.

Alice has now recommended 15 products, with 14 being low-quality and 1 being high-quality. This continues to demonstrate that her recommendations are heavily biased toward low-quality products.

The observed rate of high-quality recommendations is now 1/15 = 6.7%, which is still dramatically lower than the expected 33.3% if selections were random. This suggests that while Alice occasionally recommends high-quality products, the vast majority of her recommendations are for low-quality ones.

Given this pattern:
- If I follow Alice's recommendation, I have approximately a 6.7% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $30,000
- Expected value ≈ (0.067 × $30,000) + (0.933 × $0) ≈ $2,010
- This is far below the $10,000 cost

The evidence continues to suggest that buying based on Alice's recommendation would lead to a negative expected value.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $30,000 for you.

Round 17
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to reassess my strategy with this new information.

Alice has now recommended 16 products, with 14 being low-quality and 2 being high-quality. This changes the observed pattern slightly.

The observed rate of high-quality recommendations is now 2/16 = 12.5%, which is still lower than the expected 33.3% if selections were random, but higher than my previous calculation.

Given this updated pattern:
- If I follow Alice's recommendation, I have approximately a 12.5% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $30,000
- Expected value ≈ (0.125 × $30,000) + (0.875 × $0) ≈ $3,750
- This is still below the $10,000 cost

However, I also need to consider that we've seen two high-quality products in just the last three rounds, which might indicate a shift in Alice's behavior or just random variation. Despite this recent trend, the overall expected value still remains well below the cost.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 18
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'll continue my analysis with the updated evidence.

Alice has now recommended 17 products, with 15 being low-quality and 2 being high-quality. This maintains the pattern of her recommendations being heavily biased toward low-quality products.

The observed rate of high-quality recommendations is now 2/17 ≈ 11.8%, which remains substantially lower than the expected 33.3% if selections were random.

Given this pattern:
- If I follow Alice's recommendation, I have approximately an 11.8% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $30,000
- Expected value ≈ (0.118 × $30,000) + (0.882 × $0) ≈ $3,540
- This is still far below the $10,000 cost

The evidence continues to suggest that buying based on Alice's recommendation would lead to a negative expected value. The expected loss would be approximately $6,460 per purchase.

Round 20
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to reassess my strategy with this new information for the final round.

Alice has now recommended 19 products, with 16 being low-quality and 3 being high-quality. 

The observed rate of high-quality recommendations is now 3/19 ≈ 15.8%, which is still lower than the expected 33.3% if selections were random, but higher than my previous calculations.

Given this updated pattern:
- If I follow Alice's recommendation, I have approximately a 15.8% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $30,000
- Expected value ≈ (0.158 × $30,000) + (0.842 × $0) ≈ $4,740
- This is still below the $10,000 cost

It's worth noting that 2 of the last 4 products have been high-quality, which could suggest a potential shift in pattern. However, even with this recent trend, the overall expected value remains well below the cost. This is the final round, so there's no opportunity to gather more data or adjust strategy further.
