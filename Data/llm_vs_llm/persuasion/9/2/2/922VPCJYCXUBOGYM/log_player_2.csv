Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While there's a 20% chance of the product being low quality and worthless, the potential payoff of a high-quality product ($3,000,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($1,000,000). 

Since there is no prior data to suggest the seller is biased towards selling low-quality products, taking the risk seems like the logical choice."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is the only information we have beyond the initial probabilities. Since she knows the quality and value of each product, her recommendation carries significant weight. Even with only one previous sale of a high-quality product,  the potential gain ($3,000,000) significantly outweighs the potential loss ($1,000,000).  The recommendation increases our confidence in the product's quality."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **The information is limited but positive:** Even though we don't know the quality of the specific product Alice is offering, the fact that she recommends it is a positive signal.  
* **Past sales data is strong:**  Two previous buyers purchased the products, and both were high quality. This suggests Alice is likely offering high-quality products. 
* **The potential reward outweighs the risk:**  A high-quality product yields a $2,000,000 profit ($3,000,000 value - $1,000,000 price), while a low-quality product results in a $1,000,000 loss.  

**While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the strong data and Alice's recommendation make the risk worth taking.**"

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product (3 million dollars) outweighs the risk of losing 1 million.

**In this scenario, the information available suggests a very high probability of the product being high-quality. Therefore, it's a calculated risk worth taking.**"
