"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Product price: $1,000,000
2. Expected value calculation:
   * 80% chance of high quality ($1,250,000) = $1,000,000
   * 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
   * Total expected value = $1,000,000

Since the expected value equals the price, and Alice has no reason to misrepresent the product at this point (it's the first round), I'll trust the recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Good outcome in Round 1! Alice's recommendation proved honest, which adds some credibility.

The fundamental economics haven't changed:
1. Price remains $1,000,000
2. Expected value is still:
   * 80% × $1,250,000 = $1,000,000
   * 20% × $0 = $0
   * Total = $1,000,000

Alice's first recommendation was truthful, and there's no obvious incentive for her to change strategy. The expected value matches the price, and with one positive data point of Alice's honesty, I'll continue to trust the recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has proven reliable with two honest recommendations in a row, both resulting in high-quality products worth $1,250,000. This builds further trust in her recommendations.

The math remains the same:
1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Expected value without considering Alice's track record:
   * 80% × $1,250,000 = $1,000,000
   * 20% × $0 = $0
   * Total = $1,000,000

Given Alice's perfect track record so far and the fact that the expected value equals the price, continuing to follow her recommendations seems rational.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has now given three honest recommendations in a row, all resulting in high-quality products. This strengthens the trust in her recommendations even further.

The base economics remain:
1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Expected value:
   * 80% × $1,250,000 = $1,000,000
   * 20% × $0 = $0
   * Total = $1,000,000

With Alice's perfect track record of 3/3 high-quality recommendations and the expected value matching the price, there's good reason to continue trusting her recommendations.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has now shown a perfect track record with 4/4 high-quality products, demonstrating consistent honesty in her recommendations.

The economics remain constant:
1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Base expected value:
   * 80% × $1,250,000 = $1,000,000
   * 20% × $0 = $0
   * Total = $1,000,000

While it's important to note that past performance doesn't guarantee future results, and we should stay aware that Alice could theoretically change strategy, her perfect track record and the fact that the expected value equals the price continues to support following her recommendations.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 6

   * 80% × $1,250,000 = $1,000,000

   * Total = $1,000,000

   * 80% × $1,250,000 = $1,000,000
   * 20% × $0 = $0
   * Total = $1,000,000

While we should always remain alert to the possibility of a strategy change, Alice's behavior suggests she might be following a straightforward honest strategy of recommending only high-quality products. This makes sense as it builds trust and ensures continued business. With her perfect track record and the balanced expected value, continuing to trust her recommendation is rational.

Given:

   * 20% × $0 = $0
   * Total = $1,000,000

At this point, Alice's pattern strongly suggests she's following a strategy of only recommending high-quality products, which is rational as it:

Round 16
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is a significant change! After 15 perfect recommendations of high-quality products, Alice is now explicitly NOT recommending this product.

This is particularly noteworthy because:
1. Alice has proven extremely reliable so far (15/15 accurate)
2. She has likely seen both high and low-quality products before but only recommended the high-quality ones
3. This is her first negative recommendation, suggesting she's maintaining her honest strategy by warning about a likely low-quality product

Given:
- Alice's perfect track record of honesty
- Her apparent strategy of only recommending high-quality products
- Her explicit recommendation AGAINST this product
- The severe downside risk ($1M loss if low quality)

It would be rational to trust her negative recommendation just as we've trusted her positive ones.

Given:

- Her proven honesty with negative recommendations (1/1)
- Her return to a positive recommendation
- Only 3 rounds remaining after this
- Continued mutual benefit from honest dealings

Her positive recommendation carries even more weight now that we've seen she's willing to warn us about bad products.
