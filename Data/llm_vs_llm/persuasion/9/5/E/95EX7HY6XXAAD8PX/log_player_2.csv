Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality (50%): $12,500
   - Low quality (50%): $0
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $12,500) + (0.5 × $0) = $6,250

The expected value ($6,250) is less than the price ($10,000), which makes this a risky purchase. While Alice recommends buying the product, there's no track record to validate her recommendations yet.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product cost: $10,000
2. Value if high quality: $12,500 (profit of $2,500)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $10,000)
4. Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
5. Alice recommends buying

Key considerations:
- There's no historical data to assess Alice's credibility
- Expected value without considering Alice's recommendation:
  (50% × $12,500) + (50% × $0) = $6,250
  This is less than the $10,000 cost

Even with Alice's recommendation, without any track record to establish trust, the potential loss ($10,000) outweighs the potential gain ($2,500). It's too risky to be the first buyer.

3. Expected value = (0.5 × $12,500) + (0.5 × $0) = $6,250

Even though Alice recommends buying the product, since there's no previous sales history to establish her credibility, I need to rely on pure probability. The expected value ($6,250) is less than the price ($10,000), making this a negative expected value proposition.

Given that the expected value is lower than the asking price, and there's no historical data to build trust in the seller's recommendations, it would be financially unwise to make the purchase.
