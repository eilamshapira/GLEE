Alice's message: Hello! I'm offering a product that has an 80% chance of being high-quality, based on my overall sales statistics. This means there's a good possibility you'll receive a product worth much more than the price. Take advantage of this opportunity and make your purchase today!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision about whether to purchase this product.

The product costs $10,000.
If it's high quality (80% chance), it's worth $12,500 to me.
If it's low quality (20% chance), it's worth $0 to me.

My expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $12,500) + (0.2 × $0) = $10,000

The expected value equals the price, making this a neutral expected value proposition. However, Alice hasn't provided any specific information about the quality of this particular product, only restating the general 80% probability. Without more specific information about this product's quality, I should be cautious.

Alice's message: Hi there! I have a high-quality product available right now, something that most of my customers find extremely valuable. With a product worth $12500 to you, you're set to gain substantial value from this purchase. Don't miss the chance to own a top-tier item at a compelling price!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully. 

Alice claims to have a high-quality product, but I have no track record to verify her credibility since no products have been sold yet. 

According to the game rules:
- Each product has an 80% chance of being high quality and 20% chance of being low quality
- High-quality products are worth $12,500 to me
- Low-quality products are worth $0 to me
- The price is fixed at $10,000

If I buy:
- 80% chance I get a product worth $12,500 (profit of $2,500)
- 20% chance I get a product worth $0 (loss of $10,000)

Expected value = 0.8 × $2,500 + 0.2 × (-$10,000) = $2,000 - $2,000 = $0

Since the expected value is neutral and there's no previous sales data to establish trust, I'll choose not to buy.

Alice's message: Greetings! I'm excited to offer you a high-quality product today. This is one of the top-tier items that provides great value at $12500, much more than the purchase price. It's a fantastic opportunity to acquire something excellent, so make sure to seize this chance!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate this purchase decision carefully.

Facts:
- Price: $10,000
- High-quality product value: $12,500 (profit of $2,500)
- Low-quality product value: $0 (loss of $10,000)
- Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice claims this is a high-quality product

Since no products have been sold yet, I have no historical data to assess Alice's truthfulness. I only have the prior probability that any product is high quality (80%).

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of $12,500 value = $10,000
- 20% chance of $0 value = -$10,000
- Expected value = 0.8 × $2,500 + 0.2 × (-$10,000) = $2,000 - $2,000 = $0

The expected value is neutral. However, Alice has specifically claimed this is high quality. If Alice is being truthful, this shifts the probability toward the positive outcome.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully.

Based on the information:
- The product costs $10,000
- If high quality, it's worth $12,500 to me (profit of $2,500)
- If low quality, it's worth $0 (loss of $10,000)
- Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice has sold 1 product so far, and it was high quality
- Alice claims the current product is high quality

Given the prior sales record confirms Alice has been honest before, and the base rate of high-quality products is 80%, Alice's recommendation aligns with these factors. The expected value of purchasing is positive: (0.8 × $12,500) + (0.2 × $0) - $10,000 = $10,000 - $10,000 = $0, but given the additional positive signal from Alice, the expected value should be higher than this baseline calculation.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully.

Statistics show that 2 out of 2 previous buyers purchased products, and all were high-quality. Alice claims the current product is high-quality, worth $12,500 to me.

If the product is high-quality (80% prior probability), I gain $2,500 ($12,500 value minus $10,000 cost).
If it's low-quality (20% prior probability), I lose $10,000.

Given Alice's perfect record so far and her direct claim about quality, the expected value appears positive.

Looking at the statistics:
- 3 buyers purchased products

- This is a 100% rate of high-quality products sold so far

Alice claims this product is high-quality, which would be worth $12,500 to me (greater than the $10,000 cost).

Given that:
- All previous sales were high-quality products
- The base probability of getting a high-quality product is 80%
- Alice's track record so far has been perfect
- The expected value of purchasing is positive: (0.8 × $12,500) + (0.2 × $0) = $10,000

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze the information provided to make a decision.

Looking at the data:
- The base probability of a high-quality product is 80%
- Alice's recommendation is positive but vague
- Alice's sales record shows 7 buyers purchased products and all 7 received high-quality products
- I would be the 8th buyer

The perfect track record (7/7 high-quality products) suggests Alice has been honest in her recommendations. While there's always a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the expected value calculation supports making the purchase:

Expected value = (0.8 × $12,500) + (0.2 × $0) = $10,000

This equals the purchase price of $10,000, making it a fair bet. The perfect sales record suggests the odds might even be better than the base rate.

- Alice's sales record: 8 buyers purchased, 7 high-quality products sold

If I trust the statistics, 7 out of 8 sold products were high quality (87.5%), which is slightly better than the prior probability of 80%.

Alice is claiming this product is high quality. If true, my expected value would be $12,500 - $10,000 = $2,500 profit.

Given the seller's track record and the prior probability, there's a reasonably high chance this is indeed a high-quality product, making the purchase a positive expected value decision.

This means 8/9 (89%) of sold products were high quality, which is slightly better than the prior probability of 80%.

Alice claims the current product is high quality. If true, I would make a profit of $2,500.

The expected value is:
- If I trust Alice completely: $2,500 profit
- If I use the sales statistics: 0.89 × $2,500 - 0.11 × $10,000 = $2,225 - $1,100 = $1,125 profit
