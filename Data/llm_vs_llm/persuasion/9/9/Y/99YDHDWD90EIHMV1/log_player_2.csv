Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my decision process:

*   **Prior Belief:** Initially, I believe there's a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product (worth $300) and a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product (worth $0).
*   **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends I buy the product. Since Alice knows the quality, her recommendation must mean the product is high quality.
*   **Updated Belief:** Given Alice's recommendation, I update my belief to 100% that the product is high quality.
*   **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying is now $300 (since I believe it's definitely high quality) minus the price of $100, which equals $200.
*   **Decision:** Since the expected value ($200) is positive, I should buy the product.
