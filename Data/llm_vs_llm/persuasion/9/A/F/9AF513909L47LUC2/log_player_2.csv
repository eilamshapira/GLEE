Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes""}

Explanation:
Given the game's setup, the expected value of each product is:
0.5 * $400 + 0.5 * $0 = $200

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"":""yes""}

Explanation:
We're halfway through the rounds. So far, you've encountered 7 low-quality products and 2 high-quality products.

Additionally, the ""long-term implications"" mentioned by Alice are irrelevant, as each round is an independent event with no connection to previous or future rounds.
