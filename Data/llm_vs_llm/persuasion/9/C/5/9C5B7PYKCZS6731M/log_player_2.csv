"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this strategically.

If Alice is being truthful in her recommendation, she's suggesting this might be a low-quality product. Given that:
- Product costs $10,000
- High-quality product value: $20,000 (50% chance)
- Low-quality product value: $0 (50% chance)
- Alice knows the true quality
- Alice recommends NOT to buy

Since Alice knows the true quality and is advising against buying, this is likely a low-quality product. If it's low-quality, I would lose $10,000 by buying it.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. In Round 1, Alice was honest - she recommended against buying a low-quality product
2. Now Alice is recommending to buy the product
3. Given her previous honesty and current recommendation:
   - This is likely a high-quality product
   - If high-quality, it's worth $20,000 to me
   - Cost is $10,000
   - Potential profit: $10,000
4. Alice seems to be giving honest recommendations so far

Since Alice is recommending to buy, and she proved honest in Round 1, this is likely a high-quality product which would give me a $10,000 profit.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the pattern so far:

1. Round 1: Alice said don't buy → was low-quality → honest
2. Round 2: Alice said buy → was high-quality → honest
3. Now Alice is recommending to buy again

Alice has been completely honest in her recommendations so far, which suggests she's playing a cooperative strategy rather than trying to deceive. When she recommends buying, it has proven to be a high-quality product worth $20,000.

Since:
- Alice has been truthful
- She's recommending to buy
- The potential profit is $10,000 ($20,000 - $10,000)
- She has no apparent incentive to start deceiving now

{""decision"": ""yes""}"

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
