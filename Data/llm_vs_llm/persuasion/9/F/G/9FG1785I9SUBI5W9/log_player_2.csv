Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the setup of the game, Alice's recommendation does not provide any additional information about the quality of the product. The probability of the product being high quality remains 33.33%, and the expected value of the product is:

(0.3333 * $400) + (0.6667 * $0) = $133.32

Since the expected value ($133.32) is greater than the cost ($100), it makes sense to buy the product.
