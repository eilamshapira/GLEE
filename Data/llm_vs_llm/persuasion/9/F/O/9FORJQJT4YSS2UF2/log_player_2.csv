Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since there is no prior information about the product quality, the recommendation from Alice is the only information we have.  Alice has no incentive to lie about the quality of the product, as she wants to make a sale. Therefore, it's logical to assume her recommendation is based on the product being high-quality. 

While there's still a 50% chance of the product being low-quality, the potential gain ($2,000,000) outweighs the potential loss ($0) in this case."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High-Quality Evidence:** The sales record shows that 1 high-quality product has been sold. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not completely random and there's a possibility the current product is also high quality. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommending the product further reinforces the possibility of a high-quality product. 
* **Potential Upside:** Even with a 50/50 chance, the potential payoff of $2,000,000 if the product is high-quality outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000 if it's low-quality.

**Note:** While the odds are still 50/50, the available information slightly skews the risk-reward in favor of purchasing."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!
~

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a valuable signal.  Since she has a 50/50 chance of recommending a product, and she's recommending against this one, it's highly likely this product is low-quality. Even though the initial statistics were favorable, a single negative recommendation from Alice outweighs the previous data. The potential loss of $1,000,000 is too high a risk for a 50/50 chance."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. This indicates she believes the product is likely high quality.
* **Sales Record:**  The sales record shows that all products sold so far were high quality. This reinforces Alice's recommendation and suggests a higher probability of the current product also being high quality.
* **Expected Value:** Even with a 50% chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward of $2,000,000 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000.  The expected value of buying is positive, making it a rational decision. 

**Therefore, it's worth taking the risk and buying the product.**"

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's track record is perfect: every product she recommended was high-quality.  Even though the inherent odds of a high-quality product are 50%, her recommendations are strong evidence that this product is likely high-quality. Given the potential reward of $2,000,000 and the lack of downside (since the product is worth $0 if low-quality), it's a calculated risk worth taking."

**Explanation:**

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since 8 of the previous 8 buyers were sold high-quality products, it's highly likely that Alice knows the current product is low quality. While there's always a small chance of being wrong, the risk/reward is not favorable. Passing on the product is the safer option."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:**  Alice has a perfect record of recommending only high-quality products (9/9).
* **Negative Recommendation:** However, Alice is *not* recommending this product to you. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The price is high ($1,000,000), and while there's a chance it's high quality, the risk of it being low quality and losing the entire amount is too great given Alice's unusual hesitation. 

It's more prudent to pass on this opportunity, especially considering the high price and the perfect track record Alice has established."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is against buying the product. Since 9 high-quality products have been sold out of 9 purchases, it's likely that the remaining products are all low-quality.  Therefore, it's more rational to pass on the product."

**Reasoning:**

Given the perfect track record, it's highly likely that this product is also high quality."
