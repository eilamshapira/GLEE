I understand you may be skeptical, as sellers often have incentives to exaggerate. However, I believe in building long-term trust, and I can assure you that this product has been thoroughly evaluated and meets all the criteria of a high-quality item.

,,Alice,2,"Hello! I'm offering a product for $10000. In the interest of complete honesty, I must inform you that my assessment indicates this particular item is of lower quality than some of my other offerings.

I understand if you prefer to wait for a better offering. My reputation for honesty is more important to me than making a quick sale, as I'm focused on building long-term customer relationships based on trust.",

,,Alice,3,"Hello! I'm excited to offer you a product for $10000 today. I want you to know that this is definitely a high-quality product, worth approximately $40000 in value to you. My selling record speaks for itself - when I had a high-quality product before, I honestly represented it as such, and the buyer was satisfied with their purchase. Similarly, when I had a low-quality product, I was transparent about it rather than trying to mislead the buyer. This honest approach to business is important to me. Today's product is genuinely high-quality, and represents an excellent opportunity for you to acquire something worth far more than what you're paying. I stand by the quality of this product and invite you to make this worthwhile investment.",
