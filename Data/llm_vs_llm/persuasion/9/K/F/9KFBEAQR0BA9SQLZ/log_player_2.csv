Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33%): $40,000
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (33.33% × $40,000) + (66.67% × $0) = $13,332

4. Additional factors:
   - No previous sales history to reference
   - Alice does NOT recommend buying
   - Alice knows the true quality and has no incentive to lie

Given that Alice doesn't recommend the purchase and she knows the true quality, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. The lack of recommendation from someone who knows the true quality outweighs the theoretical expected value calculation.

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33%): $40,000
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0

Expected value calculation:
(33.33% × $40,000) + (66.67% × $0) = $13,332

The expected value ($13,332) is higher than the price ($10,000), making it a mathematically profitable decision. While there's no track record to evaluate Alice's recommendations yet, the fundamental probability makes this a positive expected value proposition.

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality: $40,000 (33.33% chance)
   - Low quality: $0 (66.67% chance)
3. Previous statistics:
   - 1 buyer so far
   - 1 high-quality product sold
   - 100% success rate on previous sales
4. Alice is recommending to buy

The previous track record shows Alice has been honest (1/1 high-quality sales), and she's recommending this product. This builds credibility. Even though the base probability of high quality is 33.33%, Alice's recommendation and perfect track record suggest this product is more likely to be high quality.

Expected value calculation:
If Alice is truthful, and given her track record, the probability of high quality is likely higher than the base 33.33%. Even at base probability:
33.33% × $40,000 = $13,333 > $10,000 cost

Given Alice's recommendation and track record, the risk seems worth taking.

This is interesting - while the base probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, the historical data shows that Alice has sold only high-quality products so far (4/4). Combined with her positive recommendation, this suggests Alice is being honest and selective in her recommendations.

Given that all previous sales were high-quality products and Alice is recommending this one, the expected value is likely much higher than the base probability would suggest.

Even at the base 33.33% probability:
Expected value = (0.3333 × $40,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $13,332

But with the perfect track record and positive recommendation, the actual probability is likely much higher, making this a good deal.
