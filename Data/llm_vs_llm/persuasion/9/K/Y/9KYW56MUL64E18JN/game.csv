,,Bob,2,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I want to be upfront with you, the price of $10000 is a standard offer, but I encourage you to consider the overall probability of getting a high-quality product. Sometimes it's worth taking a chance, and sometimes it's not. The decision is yours.",

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I believe our streak of bad luck has finally come to an end. This product has the potential to be a game-changer, and I'm confident that it will exceed your expectations.

,,Alice,10,"I'm starting to think that you're waiting for a sign or a guarantee, but I want to remind you that the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 33.33%. We've had two high-quality products in a row now, and I truly believe that this one is worth the investment.

,,Alice,12,"We're in a bit of a slump again, and unfortunately, this product is not the one to turn things around. I'm not going to try to convince you to buy it, as it's not in your best interest. Let's focus on the bigger picture and wait for a product that's actually worth the $10000 price tag.",
,,Bob,12,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I think it's clear that we're due for a change in luck. Three low-quality products in a row is unusual, and I'm confident that the next one will be an improvement. However, this particular product is not worth your investment. Let's just get through this one and look forward to the next opportunity.",
,,Bob,13,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
