Round 8
Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm going to be honest with you, I'm only offering this product to you because I have to. Our team has deemed it unfit for general release, and I've been told that it's not worth the investment. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that I think you'd be making a mistake by buying it. I've seen the results of our testing, and I can confidently say that this product is not worth your money. Please, for your own sake, do not buy this product.

This product has been thoroughly tested and has received rave reviews from our team. It's a game-changer, and I'm confident that you'll love it.

But I will say that this product is the real deal, and if you're willing to give us another chance, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. It's still $1000000, but for once, I think it's actually worth it.

Alice's message: Bob, I... I don't even know what to say. You've continued to purchase our worst products, despite my warnings. I've tried to be honest with you, I've tried to steer you away from these lemons, but you just keep buying them. This product is no different. It's a complete waste of your money. I'm not even going to bother trying to describe it, because I know you'll just buy it anyway. Look, I'll just be blunt: this product is trash. Don't buy it. Please, for the love of all things sane, do not waste another $1000000 on this garbage.

Round 12
Alice's message: Bob, I'm at a loss. I've tried everything to get you to stop buying our bad products, and yet you just keep coming back for more. I'm starting to think that you're either a glutton for punishment or a saint with a penchant for charity. But despite all that, I'm going to try again. This product, Bob, is actually good. It's really, really good. Our team has worked tirelessly to make sure it's perfect, and I'm confident that you'll love it. But I'm not going to try to sell it to you, because I know that my words are clearly meaningless to you. Instead, I'll just say this: if you buy this product, I promise you that it will be worth your money. But if you don't, I won't be surprised. It's still $1000000, and I'll just sit here and wait for your inevitable purchase.

Round 13
Alice's message: Bob, I've given up trying to understand your purchasing decisions. You've bought every single one of our products, regardless of quality. At this point, I'm just going to assume that you're collecting them or something. So, here's the deal: this product is great. It's one of the best we've ever made. But I'm not going to try to convince you to buy it, because I know you're going to buy it anyway. I'm just going to list the features and specs, and you can do with that information what you will. It's $1000000, just like all the others. Go ahead and buy it, Bob. I'll just be over here, shaking my head in amazement.
