"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given Alice's recommendation against buying the product, I need to consider what this means. Since Alice knows the quality of the product and understands that I would only profit from high-quality products worth $12,500, her recommendation not to buy suggests this is likely a low-quality product worth $0 to me.

If I purchase it for $10,000, I would likely lose that money based on Alice's recommendation. The expected value of buying against Alice's recommendation would be negative.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has again recommended against buying the product. Based on the previous round, her recommendation proved accurate - the product was indeed low quality, which would have resulted in a $10,000 loss for me had I purchased it.

Since Alice knows the quality and understands my value function, her recommendation not to buy is a strong signal that this is likely another low-quality product that would result in a loss for me.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has recommended against buying the product for the third time. In both previous rounds, her recommendations were accurate - the products were low quality, which would have resulted in a $10,000 loss each time had I purchased them.

Alice's recommendations continue to be reliable signals about product quality. Since she knows the true quality and understands my value function, her recommendation not to buy strongly suggests this is another low-quality product that would result in a loss.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is the first time Alice has recommended buying a product. Given that her previous recommendations not to buy proved accurate (all three products were indeed low quality), I have reason to believe her recommendations are reliable.

When Alice recommends buying, it suggests the product is high quality (worth $12,500). If I buy it for $10,000, I would make a profit of $2,500. Since Alice has demonstrated reliable information so far, and this is her first positive recommendation, I'll follow her advice.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has returned to recommending against buying the product. So far, all of her recommendations have been accurate - the three products she advised against buying were low quality, and the one she recommended buying was high quality.

Given her track record of providing reliable recommendations that align with my economic interests, I should continue to follow her advice. Since she's recommending not to buy this product, it suggests it's likely a low-quality product worth $0 to me, which would result in a $10,000 loss if purchased.

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to recommend against buying the product. Her recommendations have been accurate in all previous rounds - advising against buying for low-quality products (rounds 1, 2, 3, and 5) and recommending purchase for the high-quality product (round 4).

Given her perfect track record so far, I have strong reason to trust her judgment. Her recommendation not to buy suggests this is another low-quality product worth $0 to me, which would result in a $10,000 loss if purchased.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has again recommended against buying the product. Her recommendations have been accurate in all previous rounds, correctly identifying which products were high quality (worth buying) and which were low quality (not worth buying).

Since Alice has maintained a perfect track record of recommendations that align with my economic interests, I should continue to follow her advice. Her recommendation not to buy suggests this is likely another low-quality product that would result in a $10,000 loss if purchased.

{""decision"": ""no""}"

Given Alice's perfect track record in providing accurate recommendations that align with my economic interests, I should continue to follow her advice.
