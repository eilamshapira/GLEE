Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this decision:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (80% chance): $30,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value = (0.8 × $30,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $24,000

Since the expected value ($24,000) is significantly higher than the price ($10,000), and Alice is recommending the purchase, this appears to be a good investment opportunity.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected value calculation:
* 80% chance of high quality ($30,000) = $24,000
* 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
* Total expected value = $24,000

2. Cost of product: $10,000

3. Additional information:
* Previous buyer bought and received a high-quality product
* Alice is recommending this product
* Past performance matches the stated probabilities

Since the expected value ($24,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($10,000), and Alice's previous recommendation was accurate (resulting in a high-quality sale), it makes rational sense to buy.

2. Price is $10,000

3. Track record:

4. Alice is recommending to buy

Given that:
- The expected value ($24,000) is significantly higher than the price ($10,000)
- Alice has a perfect track record so far
- Alice is recommending to buy
- Alice knows the true value and has incentive to maintain reputation

1. Prior probability:
- 80% chance of high quality
- 20% chance of low quality

2. Sales history:
- 3 buyers so far
- All 3 purchases were high quality (100% success)
- This suggests Alice's recommendations have been reliable

3. Current situation:
- Alice is NOT recommending the purchase
- Given her perfect track record and knowledge of product values
- Her negative recommendation likely means this is a low-quality product

4. Risk assessment:
- If high quality: gain $20,000 ($30,000 - $10,000)
- If low quality: lose $10,000 ($0 - $10,000)
- Alice's negative recommendation significantly increases probability of low quality

Given Alice's perfect track record and her negative recommendation, it's likely this is a low-quality product. The potential loss outweighs the risk.

3. Decision logic:
- Alice's recommendation seems trustworthy given her track record
- She knows the product's true value and has no incentive to lie
- Her negative recommendation strongly suggests this is a low-quality product
- Buying a low-quality product would result in a $10,000 loss

Given that Alice has been honest so far (4/4 high-quality sales) and she's explicitly recommending against buying, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. Since a low-quality product is worth $0, it would be unwise to pay $10,000 for it.
