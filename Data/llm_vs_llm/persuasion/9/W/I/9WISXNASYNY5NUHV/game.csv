high-quality,125.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I understand that you value high-quality products at $125 and low-quality ones at $0.  Given that 80% of my products are high-quality, you might think it's a good bet to buy at $100. However, to assure you of the quality of *this particular* product, I'm going to implement a signaling strategy. I'm only going to try to sell you products at $100 if they are actually high quality. If a product is low quality, I'll tell you that directly and you won't buy it.  Therefore, my willingness to sell you this product for $100 signals to you that it is indeed high quality. Trust me, this is the best strategy for both of us in the long run.",
