Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make a decision, let's consider the information provided:

1. All 2 products sold so far have been high-quality, and both buyers bought products based on Alice's recommendations.
2. Alice recommends that you buy the product.

Given this information, there's a good track record that Alice has recommended high-quality products.
