"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Expected Value:** Without a recommendation, the expected value of a product is 0.5 * $40,000 + 0.5 * $0 = $20,000. This is higher than the selling price of $10,000. However...
* **Alice's Information:** Alice knows the true quality of the product. Her lack of recommendation suggests that the product is likely low quality. It's in her best interest to recommend high-quality products to gain your trust and make future sales.

Therefore, it's strategically wiser to pass on this product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The same logic from Round 1 applies. Alice has more information than we do, and her silence is a strong indicator that the product is not worth purchasing.  We should continue to be cautious until we see a pattern that suggests otherwise."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation changes our understanding of the situation. Here's why:

* **Potential Profit:**  A high-quality product offers a $30,000 profit ($40,000 value - $10,000 price). 
* **Risk of Loss:** The potential loss is capped at $10,000 (the purchase price).
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice is more likely to recommend a product when it benefits her, which means it's more likely to be a high-quality product in this scenario.

While there's still a chance the product is low quality, the potential reward outweighs the risk, especially given Alice's recommendation."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

```

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has recommended buying every time so far, and every recommendation has led to a high-quality product. While this trend seems unlikely to continue indefinitely (as it would mean she's giving away her advantage), we have no reason to doubt her yet.  We should continue buying until we see a signal to change strategies."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 8
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical shift in the game. Alice's silence suggests this product is likely low quality. 

* **Shift in Strategy:** Alice might be changing her approach now that we've consistently followed her recommendations.
* **Maintaining Trust:** By recommending only high-quality products for a period, she built trust. Now, she might try to leverage that trust to sell a low-quality product.

It's time to be cautious and avoid the purchase."

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
