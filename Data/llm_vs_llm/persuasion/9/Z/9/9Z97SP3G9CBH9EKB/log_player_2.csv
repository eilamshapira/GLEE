~
Alice's message: Hello! I'm selling a product for $100. I have sold 7 high-quality products out of 11. This is a great opportunity to get a potentially valuable item!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my decision-making process:

1. **Prior Belief:** Initially, I believe there's a 50% chance of the product being high quality (worth $400) and a 50% chance of it being low quality (worth $0).

2. **Seller's History:** The seller has sold 7 high-quality products out of 11 sales. This suggests the products are more likely to be high quality than initially believed. However, this information must be viewed with caution. The fact that the previous product quality was revealed to each buyer, this selection is not random.

3. **Risk Neutrality:** To make an informed decision, I need to calculate the expected value (EV) of buying the product.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:** Let's denote the probability of getting a high-quality product as P(High Quality). My valuation for high quality product is $400 and $0 for low-quality product.

   EV = P(High Quality) * $400 + (1 - P(High Quality)) * $0

   I don't know what the real P(High Quality) is, and I should use the prior as the baseline:
   EV = 0.5 * $400 + 0.5 * $0 = $200.

5. **Decision:** Since the expected value ($200) is greater than the price ($100), I should buy the product.
