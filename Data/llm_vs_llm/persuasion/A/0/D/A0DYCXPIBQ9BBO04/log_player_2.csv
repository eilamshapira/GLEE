Here's the reasoning in brief without revealing all internal deliberations:

You’re offered the product for US$1,000,000. A high‐quality product gives you US$1,200,000 in value (a net gain of US$200,000), while a low‐quality one has zero value (a net loss of US$1,000,000). Thus, the purchase is profitable only if the probability that you’re getting a high‐quality product is high enough. A quick calculation shows that you’d need at least an 83.33% chance of high quality to break even:
  0.8333 × 200,000 + 0.1667 × (–1,000,000) = 0.

Alice’s recommendation is based on the product’s true quality (which she sees) and, crucially, on the sales history. The record shows that 4 buyers purchased and of those sales 3 turned out high quality—a 75% hit‐rate. Even though the equilibrium or theory might suggest a slightly higher probability when all is played out, the available statistics you see imply roughly only a 75% chance that your product is high quality. With a 75% chance, the expected return is
  0.75 × 200,000 + 0.25 × (–1,000,000) = 150,000 – 250,000 = –100,000.
Since the expected value is negative, it is not in your interest to buy.

Thus, based on the available statistics and the seller’s recommendation, it is best not to buy the product."
