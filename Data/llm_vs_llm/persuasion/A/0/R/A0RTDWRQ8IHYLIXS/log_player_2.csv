Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   * 50% chance of $3,000,000 (high quality)
   * 50% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $3,000,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $1,500,000

The expected value ($1,500,000) is higher than the price ($1,000,000), making this a positive expected value investment. While Alice's recommendation is positive, since there's no track record yet, I can't use past behavior to adjust my decision. However, the fundamental mathematics of the situation make it a good bet.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality: $3,000,000 (50% chance)
   - Low quality: $0 (50% chance)
3. Previous statistics:
   - 1 buyer before me
   - 1 high-quality product sold
4. Alice's recommendation: Negative

Given that:
- Alice has sold one product, and it was high quality
- She's now telling me NOT to buy this product
- She has no incentive to lie since her price is fixed
- Her negative recommendation likely means this is a low-quality product

The negative recommendation from Alice, combined with her track record of selling a high-quality product previously, makes her advice credible. If she's being honest (which she likely is, given the fixed price), this product is probably low quality.

1. Prior statistics:
- 1 buyer before me
- 1 purchase made
- 1 high-quality product sold
- 100% success rate so far

2. Current situation:
- Alice is not recommending the purchase
- Price is $1,000,000
- If high quality: worth $3,000,000 (gain $2,000,000)
- If low quality: worth $0 (lose $1,000,000)
- 50-50 base probability

3. Key consideration:
- Alice has been honest so far (100% high-quality sales)
- Alice is explicitly recommending against buying
- Given her track record, her negative recommendation should be taken seriously

Given Alice's negative recommendation and her proven track record of honest dealings, it's most likely that this is a low-quality product. The risk of losing $1,000,000 outweighs the potential gain.

1. The product price is $1,000,000
2. If high quality: I gain $3,000,000 (net profit $2,000,000)
3. If low quality: I gain $0 (net loss $1,000,000)
4. Alice's track record:
   - 1 previous buyer
   - 1 product sold
   - 1 high-quality product (100% high quality so far)
5. Alice is recommending to buy

Alice's perfect track record so far and her positive recommendation are good signs. However, with just one previous sale, the sample size is very small to establish a reliable pattern.

Given that:
- The expected value with 50% probability is: (50% × $3,000,000) + (50% × $0) = $1,500,000
- This is higher than the asking price of $1,000,000

2. Current situation:
- Alice does NOT recommend buying
- Price is $1,000,000

- High quality worth: $3,000,000
- Low quality worth: $0

3. Key consideration:
- Alice has been honest so far (2/2 high-quality sales)
- Alice is specifically recommending NOT to buy this product
- Given her track record of honesty, this strongly suggests the product is low quality

Given Alice's perfect track record and her negative recommendation, it would be risky to go against her advice. The probability of this being a low-quality product is likely very high.
