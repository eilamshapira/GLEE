Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since no products have been sold yet, there's no information on the quality of past products to guide our decision. We're left with only the seller's recommendation and the initial probabilities.  The seller has a strong incentive to recommend buying, but the product has an 80% chance of being high quality, which offers a significant potential gain ($250,000).  The risk of it being low quality is outweighed by the potential reward."

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who knows the quality of the product, recommends buying it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality.
* **Previous Sales Data:**  The previous buyer purchased a high-quality product, suggesting that Alice's recommendations are accurate. 
* **Value Proposition:** Even with the risk of a low-quality product, the potential gain of $250,000 (difference between high-quality value and price) outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000. 

While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the information available makes buying the product the more rational choice."
