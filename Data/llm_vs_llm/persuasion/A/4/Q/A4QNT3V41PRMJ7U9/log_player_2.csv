If you're willing to take a chance, I'm willing to let this product go for the fixed price of $10000. Just keep in mind that the odds might not be in our favor... yet.

Alice's message: Congratulations to my previous buyer who took a chance on me! Unfortunately, the product they received wasn't the best. To be transparent, my current stats are: 0 high-quality products sold, 1 low-quality product sold out of 4 attempts. I know it's not ideal, but I'm hoping to turn things around soon. This new product might not be the one to change my streak, but it could still have some unexpected value. If you're feeling optimistic and want to support my efforts to improve, $10000 could be a unique investment opportunity.

Alice's message: Hello! I want to be upfront with you - my track record so far hasn't been great. 1 low-quality product sold, 0 high-quality products sold out of 5 attempts. However, I believe that every product has some value, even if it's not immediately apparent. I'm not giving up, and I'm hoping you won't either. If you're looking for a potential hidden gem or want to support my efforts to improve, $10000 might be a worthwhile risk.

Alice's message: Congratulations to my previous buyer who finally broke my high-quality product sales drought! My stats have improved to 1 low-quality product sold, 1 high-quality product sold out of 9 attempts. However, I have to be honest with you - this new product isn't quite up to the same standards. It's a low-quality product, and I want to set clear expectations. If you're looking for a bargain or a potential project to work on, $10000 might be a bit steep. But if you're willing to take a chance or support my efforts to improve, I appreciate your consideration. Just remember, my next high-quality product could be just around the corner...

I want to be upfront with you - this product is another low-quality one. I know it's not ideal, but I'm still learning and improving. At this point, I've had more low-quality products than I'd like to admit, and my buyers have been cautious. I don't blame them! If you're looking for a unique opportunity or want to support my growth, $10000 might be a worthwhile investment, but I have to advise you that it's a long shot. My high-quality products have been few and far between, but when they do come along, they're worth it. Maybe you'll be the one to help me turn my sales streak around, but for now, I think it's best to manage your expectations.

I'm starting to think that I need to shake things up. This product is, unfortunately, another low-quality one. I want to be honest with you - it's not worth $10000. But I'm willing to be transparent and hope that you'll see the value in supporting me, even if it's not in this particular product. Maybe you'll be the one to help me get back on track, or maybe you'll just be taking a chance on a potential underdog. Either way, I appreciate your consideration, and I hope you'll keep an eye out for my future products, which I'm hoping will be an improvement.

I want to be clear with you - this product is another low-quality one, and I wouldn't recommend spending $10000 on it.

But if you're looking for a guaranteed good deal, I'd advise you to wait for my next product or consider a different seller.

Alice's message: Hello! This is my final product, and I want to be upfront with you - it's another low-quality one. My stats stand at 1 low-quality product sold, 2 high-quality products sold out of 19 attempts. I know it's not the most impressive record, but I've learned a lot throughout this process.
