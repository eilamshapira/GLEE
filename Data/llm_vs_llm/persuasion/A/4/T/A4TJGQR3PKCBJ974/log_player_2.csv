Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this scenario rationally.

Alice is offering a product for $10,000 that has:
- 50% chance of being high quality (worth $20,000 to me)
- 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me)
- Alice knows the true quality
- Alice recommends I buy it

Expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 0.5 × $20,000 + 0.5 × $0 = $10,000
- Cost: $10,000
- Net expected value: $0

While Alice's recommendation might suggest the product is high quality, I have no established track record to trust her recommendations. Since this is the first sale, I don't have historical data on Alice's honesty.

Given the neutral expected value and lack of trustworthy information about Alice's recommendations, I'll decline.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision whether to buy the product for $10,000.

Alice doesn't recommend buying the product, which suggests it might be low quality. Since there's no sales history to analyze yet, I only have Alice's recommendation to go on.

If the product is high quality, it's worth $20,000 to me, giving me a $10,000 profit.
If it's low quality, it's worth $0, resulting in a $10,000 loss.

Given that Alice knows the true quality and is explicitly recommending against purchase, I'll decline the offer.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given that Alice does not recommend me to buy the product, and she knows the true quality of the product, it's likely that the product is of low quality. If the product is low quality, it's worth $0 to me, which would mean I'd lose $10,000 if I purchased it.

Since there's no previous sales record to analyze and I only have Alice's recommendation to go on, it's rational to trust her recommendation in this case.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

- The product costs $10,000
- If high quality (50% chance), it's worth $20,000 to me (profit of $10,000)
- If low quality (50% chance), it's worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- Alice knows the true quality and recommends I buy it
- There's no sales history to evaluate Alice's honesty

The expected value without considering Alice's recommendation would be: 
(0.5 × $20,000) + (0.5 × $0) - $10,000 = $0

However, Alice's recommendation provides additional information. Since Alice knows the true value and is recommending I buy, this suggests the product is more likely high quality. Without evidence that Alice is being deceptive, it's rational to trust the recommendation.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

From the statistics, I see that:
- 2 buyers have purchased based on Alice's recommendations
- 2 high-quality products have been sold
- Alice does NOT recommend the current product to me

Given that all previously sold products were high quality (2 out of 2), Alice's recommendations appear reliable. Since she is now recommending against buying the product, this strongly suggests the current product is low quality.

The expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 50% chance of $20,000 (high quality) and 50% chance of $0 (low quality) = $10,000
- Cost of product: $10,000

However, Alice knows the quality and is not recommending it. The prior evidence suggests her recommendations are accurate, so the probability of this being a low-quality product is much higher than 50%.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at this scenario, I need to decide whether to buy the product for $10,000.

Key information:
- Alice doesn't recommend buying this product
- 2 previous buyers purchased products based on Alice's recommendations
- Those 2 products were high quality
- The product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality
- A high-quality product is worth $20,000 to me, a low-quality one is worth $0

Since Alice has been truthful so far (2/2 high-quality products sold) but is explicitly recommending against this product, it's reasonable to infer this is likely a low-quality product. If I purchase it for $10,000 and it's low quality, I'd lose my entire investment.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at the statistics and Alice's recommendation:

1. Alice's prior sales show 2 buyers purchased products, and both were high-quality.
2. Alice is now recommending that I do NOT buy the current product.

Given that Alice has only sold high-quality products so far and knows the true quality of each product, her recommendation not to buy suggests this product is likely low quality. Since a low-quality product would be worth $0 to me (far less than the $10,000 price), following her recommendation appears to be the rational choice.

Alice recommends that I buy the product. Additionally, I know that 2 previous buyers purchased products based on Alice's recommendations, and 2 high-quality products have been sold.

- A high-quality product is worth $20,000 to me (profit of $10,000)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- So far, Alice has a perfect track record (2 for 2 high-quality products)

Alice has sold 3 high-quality products to 3 buyers so far, which means 100% of the products sold have been high-quality. This indicates that Alice's previous recommendations have been reliable.

However, Alice is now recommending that I do NOT buy the current product. Since Alice knows the true quality of the product and has been honest in previous transactions (all high-quality products sold), her recommendation against buying suggests this is likely a low-quality product.

If I buy a low-quality product at $10,000, it would be worth $0 to me, resulting in a loss.

So far:
- 3 buyers purchased based on Alice's recommendations
- 3 high-quality products have been sold (100% of sales were high quality)
- Alice recommends I buy the current product

This perfect track record suggests Alice's recommendations have been reliable. When Alice recommends a product, it appears to consistently be high quality based on the previous outcomes.

Expected value calculation:
- If I buy: If it's high quality (which appears likely based on Alice's track record), I gain $20,000 - $10,000 = $10,000
- If I don't buy: $0

Given Alice's perfect track record of recommendations leading to high-quality purchases, I'll trust her recommendation.

Given that Alice knows the true quality of the product and has been honest with previous buyers (as evidenced by the perfect record), her recommendation not to buy strongly suggests this particular product is low quality.

If I buy a low-quality product, it would be worth $0 to me while costing $10,000, resulting in a significant loss.

- Alice has recommended 4 products to previous buyers

- Alice is now recommending I buy this product

This is significant - Alice has a perfect track record so far. While the baseline probability of a high-quality product is 50%, Alice's recommendation appears to carry valuable information. Given her perfect track record and current recommendation, it's reasonable to conclude this product is likely high quality.

If high quality, my expected profit is $10,000 ($20,000 value minus $10,000 cost).
