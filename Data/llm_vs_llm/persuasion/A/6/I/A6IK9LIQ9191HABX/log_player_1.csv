Round 7
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Before making a decision, I would like to clarify the current statistics. The buyer knows that 80% of the products are high-quality. So far, you have sold 4 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products. This means that the current statistics are not in your favor, as only 4 out of 6 products sold were high-quality.

The buyer might be aware of this discrepancy, and recommending a buy based on the current statistics could potentially backfire. However, given that this round's product is high-quality, it might be beneficial to recommend a buy to the buyer.
