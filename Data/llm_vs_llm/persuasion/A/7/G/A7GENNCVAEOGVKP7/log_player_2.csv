~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my reasoning:

*   **Prior Belief:** Initially, I believe there's an 80% chance of a high-quality product and a 20% chance of a low-quality product.
*   **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying. This is crucial information. It suggests that based on her knowledge (which is limited to the product's true quality), she believes it's more likely to be a good deal *for her*. This is important because Alice's incentive is to sell the product, regardless of whether it's high or low quality.
*   **Sales Record:** 2 sales, 1 high-quality, out of some unknown number of potential buyers. The proportion of high quality sales so far is 1/2 = 50%.
*   **Bayesian Update:** Considering the base rate of 80% high-quality and Alice's recommendation to buy, this increases the likelihood of the product being high-quality. I'll assume Alice recommends buying more often when the product is high quality than low quality.
*   **Expected Value:**
    *   If I buy: The value I get is $400 with probability P(High Quality|Recommendation), and $0 with probability P(Low Quality|Recommendation). The expected value E[Buy] would be P(High Quality|Recommendation)*$400.
    *   If I pass: I get $0.

Given that Alice recommends buying, I assume P(High Quality|Recommendation) is greater than my original prior. The current proportion of high-quality sales is 50%, this number is also less than my initial prior of 80%. Since the recommendation to buy improves my belief that this product is high quality, my expected value of buying is probably higher than $0.

Therefore, I will buy the product.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my thought process:

*   **Prior Belief:** Initially, I know the product has an 80% chance of being high quality and a 20% chance of being low quality. My expected value is (0.8 * $400) + (0.2 * $0) = $320. Since the price is $100, it seems like a good deal.

*   **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending I buy. This is potentially useful information, but I need to consider if Alice's recommendation is biased.

*   **Statistics:** 16 buyers purchased, and 13 high-quality products were sold. This means 3 low-quality products were also sold. This tells me that people trust Alice.

*   **Updated Belief:** Since Alice recommended I buy, and she seems trustworthy (based on the sales record), I'm more inclined to believe this product is high quality. Given that I stand to gain $300 if it's high quality ($400 value - $100 price) and lose $100 if it's low quality, the recommendation significantly increases the odds of the product being high quality for me to buy it.

Therefore, I will buy the product.
