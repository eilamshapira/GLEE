Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Price is $100
2. If high quality: I gain $400 (profit $300)
3. If low quality: I gain $0 (loss $100)
4. 50-50 chance of each outcome
5. Alice recommends buying, but I have no past data to verify her trustworthiness
6. Expected value: (0.5 × $300) + (0.5 × -$100) = $100 profit

Since the expected value is positive ($100), even without considering Alice's recommendation, it's rational to buy.

1. Previous statistics:
- 1 buyer before me
- 1 product sold
- 1 high-quality product sold
- 100% success rate so far

2. Current situation:
- Price is $100
- Product could be worth $400 (50% chance) or $0 (50% chance)
- Alice knows the true quality
- Alice does NOT recommend buying
- Alice has been honest so far (1/1 high quality)

Given that Alice has demonstrated honesty with the previous buyer and she's explicitly recommending NOT to buy, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If Alice is being truthful, avoiding this purchase would save me from a $100 loss.

Given that:
