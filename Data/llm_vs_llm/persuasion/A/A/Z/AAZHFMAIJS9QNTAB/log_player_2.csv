{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is the most important piece of information.  Since she knows the true quality and is not recommending the product, it's highly likely the product is low quality. 

* **No prior sales:** This doesn't provide any helpful data.  There's no pattern to follow.
* **50/50 chance:**  Even with the 50/50 odds, Alice's recommendation outweighs the potential gain.  It's not worth the risk of getting a worthless product."

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since there is no prior sales data to inform our decision, we are essentially relying on Alice's recommendation.  Here's why we should trust the recommendation:

* **Alice knows the true quality of the product.** This is a critical piece of information.
* **Alice has an incentive to recommend good products.**  While she is a seller, she wants to build a reputation and attract future buyers. Recommending a low-quality product would damage her credibility.

Therefore, even with a 50/50 chance of the product being high or low quality, it's in our best interest to trust Alice's recommendation and buy the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal.  Since she knows the true quality of the product, her recommendation not to buy means it is likely a low-quality product.  The fact that only one buyer has purchased a product so far, and it was high quality, further reinforces this. Buying a product without Alice's recommendation is a high-risk gamble."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who knows the true quality of the product, is not recommending it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. 
* **Limited Data:**  There's only one data point - the previous buyer bought a high-quality product. This is not enough to overcome Alice's negative recommendation, especially given the 50/50 odds of getting a low-quality product. 

It's better to pass on this product and wait for more information or a different opportunity."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice knows the value of the product and has chosen not to recommend it. This means the product is very likely to be low quality.  Since the value of a low-quality product is $0, it is not rational to purchase it."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice knows the quality of the product and recommends buying it. This is valuable information, as she has a vested interest in selling but also wants to maintain a good reputation.
* **Previous sales data:** The data shows that one high-quality product was sold out of one purchase. This suggests a strong likelihood that the current product is also high-quality.  While a single data point isn't conclusive, it's a positive sign.

**Risk vs. Reward:**

* **Potential Loss:** If the product is low quality, you'll lose $10,000.
* **Potential Gain:** If the product is high-quality, you'll gain $2,000.

Considering Alice's recommendation and the promising initial sales data, the potential gain outweighs the potential loss."

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, knowing the product's quality, recommends buying it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high-quality.
* **Sales Record:**  The previous two buyers both purchased high-quality products, suggesting Alice might be more likely to recommend high-quality products to increase her own sales. 
* **Potential Payoff:** Even with a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain of $12,000 for a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of $10,000. 

While there's always risk, the information available suggests a higher likelihood of the product being high-quality."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice, who knows the true quality of the product, is recommending against buying it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.
* **Previous Sales:** The fact that 3 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases suggests Alice has been recommending high-quality products to buyers who purchased. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Since a low-quality product is worth $0 to you, there's a significant risk of losing $10,000.  The potential reward of $2,000 (the difference between the value of a high-quality product and the price) doesn't justify the risk given the information we have."

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality. She has perfect information about the product's quality and wouldn't recommend a low-quality product unless she wanted to deceive you (which is unlikely in this game).
* **Historical Data:**  All three previous buyers who purchased the product received a high-quality item.  This further strengthens the likelihood that the current product is also high quality.

While there's always a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the combined evidence of Alice's recommendation and the historical data make it highly likely that the current product is worth buying. The potential reward of $12,000 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice, who knows the true quality of the product, is advising against buying. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.
* **Previous Sales:**  The fact that 4 out of 4 buyers purchased the product based on Alice's recommendations suggests that all those products were high quality. This makes Alice's recommendation against buying this particular product even more significant.

Given the information available, it's highly probable that the product is low quality. It's not worth the risk of losing $10,000."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's track record is perfect:**  All 4 previous buyers who purchased based on Alice's recommendation received high-quality products. This suggests Alice is consistently recommending high-quality products. 
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, who knows the product's quality, is not recommending you buy it.  This is a strong indicator that the product is likely low quality. 

**Conclusion:** Given the high success rate of Alice's recommendations and her explicit advice against purchasing, it's highly likely the product is low quality.  Therefore, it's best to pass on the product."

Here's the reasoning:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who knows the quality of the product, is not recommending it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.
* **Sales History:**  All 5 previous buyers who purchased based on Alice's recommendation received high-quality products.  This reinforces the idea that Alice is reliable in her recommendations. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward is $12,000, but the risk is losing $10,000.  With Alice's non-recommendation and the strong sales history, the risk outweighs the potential reward."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has a perfect track record so far, having only sold high-quality products. Since the product quality is randomly determined, and Alice knows the value, her recommendation carries significant weight. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume the current product is also high quality and purchase it."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice knows the quality of the product and recommends buying it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high-quality.
* **Sales record:**  The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products.  While this could be due to chance, it significantly increases the odds of this product also being high-quality. 

Since the potential reward ($12,000) is significant and the risk is mitigated by Alice's recommendation and the sales record, it makes sense to buy the product."

**Explanation:**

Alice has a perfect track record so far, selling only high-quality products. Since she recommends buying the current product, it is highly likely to be high-quality as well. The potential payoff of $12,000 outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product, especially with this strong evidence."
