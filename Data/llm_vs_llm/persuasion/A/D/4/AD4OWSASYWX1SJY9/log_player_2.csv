Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Value: High quality = $12,500, Low quality = $0
3. Probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
4. Expected value = (0.8 × $12,500) + (0.2 × $0) = $10,000

The expected value equals the price, making this a fair offer. Additionally:
- Alice knows the true quality and recommends buying
- Being the first buyer means there's no historical data to consider
- Alice has an incentive to build a good reputation

Given Alice's recommendation and the favorable probability of high quality, I'll take the risk.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (80% chance): $12,500
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

3. Current statistics:
   - 1 buyer so far
   - 1 high-quality product sold
   - Alice doesn't recommend this product

Alice's negative recommendation is concerning, especially given that she knows the true quality and has been honest with previous buyers (1/1 high quality sold). Since she doesn't recommend this product, it's likely a low-quality product that would result in a loss of $10,000.

3. Previous sales record:

4. Alice's recommendation: Positive

Given that:
- Alice has been honest so far (1/1 high-quality sales)
- The base probability is favorable (80% high quality)
- Alice is recommending the purchase
- Expected value = (0.8 × $12,500) + (0.2 × $0) = $10,000
