{""decision"": ""yes""}
```
Given that the product is high-quality and the buyer knows that there is an 80% chance of any product being high-quality, it is a statistically sound decision to recommend the buyer to purchase the product. The expected value for the buyer is:

(0.8 * $4,000,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $3,200,000

Since the expected value ($3,200,000) is greater than the purchase price ($1,000,000), it makes sense to recommend the purchase."
