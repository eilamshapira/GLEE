Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality (50% chance): $125
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0
3. Expected value: (0.5 × $125) + (0.5 × $0) = $62.50
4. No historical data available
5. Alice recommends buying

Given that:
- The expected value ($62.50) is less than the price ($100)
- There's no track record to establish trust
- Alice has an incentive to sell regardless of quality
- The recommendation alone isn't enough to overcome the negative expected value

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 
   - 50% chance of $125 (high quality)
   - 50% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value: (0.5 × $125) + (0.5 × $0) = $62.50
4. Alice's recommendation: Positive
5. No previous sales data to verify Alice's trustworthiness

Even with Alice's positive recommendation, the expected value ($62.50) is less than the price ($100). Without any historical data to validate Alice's credibility, it would be risky to trust the recommendation alone.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price = $100
2. If high quality (50% chance): Value = $125, Profit = $25
3. If low quality (50% chance): Value = $0, Loss = -$100
4. Expected value = (50% × $125) + (50% × $0) = $62.50

Even though Alice recommends buying the product, there's no track record to establish her credibility. The expected value ($62.50) is less than the price ($100), making this a mathematically unfavorable purchase.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Each product has a 50/50 chance of being high/low quality
2. Price is $100
3. High quality is worth $125 (profit of $25)
4. Low quality is worth $0 (loss of $100)
5. Alice doesn't recommend buying
6. No previous sales history to base decisions on

Given that Alice doesn't recommend the purchase and has no established track record, this seems risky. Furthermore, the expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of $25 profit
- 50% chance of $100 loss
- Expected value = (0.5 × $25) + (0.5 × -$100) = -$37.50

The negative expected value and Alice's negative recommendation make this a poor investment.

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50% chance): $125 profit ($25 net gain)
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0 ($100 net loss)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (50% × $25) + (50% × -$100) = $12.50 - $50 = -$37.50

4. Additional factors:
   - No sales history to evaluate Alice's credibility
   - Alice recommends buying, but since this is the first sale, we can't verify her trustworthiness
   - The expected value is negative

Given that the expected value is negative and there's no historical data to trust Alice's recommendation, the rational choice would be not to buy.

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value:

3. Expected value before recommendation: ($125 × 0.5) + ($0 × 0.5) = $62.50
4. Alice's recommendation: Negative
5. Given Alice is the seller, she has an incentive to sell, so a negative recommendation likely means she knows it's low quality

Since Alice is not recommending the purchase despite having an incentive to sell, and the expected value was already below the asking price, this strongly suggests the product is low quality.

1. The product costs $100

Given that Alice is discouraging the purchase and we have no prior history to assess her trustworthiness, this suggests the product might be low quality. If Alice is being honest, avoiding a $100 loss is better than risking it for a potential $25 gain.
