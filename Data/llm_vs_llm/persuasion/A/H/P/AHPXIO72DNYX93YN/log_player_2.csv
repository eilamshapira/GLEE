Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Prior probabilities:
- 80% chance of high quality
- 20% chance of low quality

2. Track record:
- 2 previous buyers
- 2 high-quality products sold (100% success rate)
- This aligns with the base probability and supports Alice's credibility

3. Economics:
- Cost: $100
- Value if high quality: $200 (profit of $100)
- Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $100)
- Expected value = (0.8 × $200) + (0.2 × $0) - $100 = $60 profit

4. Alice's behavior:
- Perfect track record so far
- Strong positive recommendation
- Claims it's high quality

Given the high base probability, perfect track record, and positive expected value, this appears to be a good investment.

1. Track record: 
- 3 buyers so far, all got high-quality products
- 100% success rate in previous sales
- Alice has maintained perfect honesty so far

2. Current situation:
- Alice claims this is a high-quality product
- If true, I'll gain $100 ($200 value - $100 price)
- If false, I'll lose $100 ($0 value - $100 price)
- Base probability is 80% high quality, 20% low quality

3. Decision factors:
- Alice's perfect track record adds credibility
- She has incentive to maintain reputation
- The base probability favors high quality
- Her explicit claim of high quality, given her honest history, is trustworthy

Given all these factors, especially the combination of high base probability (80%) and Alice's perfect track record with honest communication, this appears to be a good opportunity.
