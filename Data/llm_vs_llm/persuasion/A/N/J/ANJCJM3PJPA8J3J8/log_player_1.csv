Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","{""decision"": ""no""}

(As you know, the price of the product is known to the buyer. They also know the probability of getting a high-quality product is 33.33%.

Consider this buyer's perspective:

If the buyer buys a high-quality product, they will get a $25 profit, since the value to them is $125, and the price is $100.
If the buyer buys a low-quality product, they will get a $100 loss, since the value to them is $0, and the price is $100.

Therefore, the buyer's expected value per product is:
0.3333 * $25 + 0.6667 * (-$100) = -$58.34

This calculation implies that a rational buyer would not buy a product unless they have additional information that leads them to believe that the specific product being offered is of high quality.
