"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $1,000,000
2. Value if high quality (80% chance): $1,200,000
3. Value if low quality (20% chance): $0
4. Expected value = (0.8 × $1,200,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $960,000

Since the expected value ($960,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), even with Alice's recommendation, it's not rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to reconsider the situation given what happened in Round 1:

1. Alice recommended a high-quality product in Round 1, suggesting her recommendations might be honest
2. The base probabilities remain:
   - 80% chance of high quality ($1,200,000)
   - 20% chance of low quality ($0)
3. Price remains $1,000,000

Even though I missed an opportunity in Round 1, the fundamental math hasn't changed. The expected value ($960,000) is still less than the price ($1,000,000). While Alice's previous honest recommendation is noteworthy, one data point isn't enough to change the underlying economics.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is getting interesting. Let's analyze the pattern:

1. Alice has recommended three products so far
2. The first two were proven to be high-quality
3. Alice seems to be showing a pattern of honest recommendations
4. However, we still have the base parameters:
   - Price: $1,000,000
   - Value if high quality: $1,200,000
   - Value if low quality: $0

While the base probability was 80% for high quality, Alice's track record of recommending two high-quality products in a row might suggest she's being selective in what she recommends. This could mean the probability of a recommended product being high quality is higher than the base 80%.

Given this pattern and Alice's apparent honesty, I'll take the risk this time.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Interesting development:

1. Alice has proven honest in her previous recommendations, with all three recommended products being high-quality
2. Now, for the first time, she is NOT recommending the product
3. Given her track record of honesty, this negative recommendation should be taken seriously
4. She might be signaling that this is a low-quality product

The fact that Alice is being consistent with positive recommendations and now explicitly not recommending suggests she's providing valuable information. If she's being honest, this is likely a low-quality product that would be worth $0 to me.

Given Alice's demonstrated trustworthiness and her negative recommendation, I should not buy.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's behavior continues to show consistency and honesty:

1. Previous track record:
   - 3 recommendations: all high-quality (worth $1,200,000)
   - 1 non-recommendation: was low-quality (worth $0)
2. Now she's again not recommending the product
3. Her recommendations have proven to be reliable indicators so far
4. She appears to be honestly signaling when products are low-quality

Given that:
- Her previous non-recommendation correctly indicated a low-quality product
- She's maintaining a consistent pattern of honest signaling
- The risk of buying a non-recommended product is significant ($1,000,000 loss if low-quality)

I will trust her negative recommendation again.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's signaling continues to be perfectly reliable:

1. Her track record so far:
   - When recommending (3 times): all were high-quality ($1,200,000)
   - When not recommending (2 times): all were low-quality ($0)
2. She's now giving her third non-recommendation
3. She has demonstrated a perfect pattern of honest signaling
4. There's no reason to doubt her signal now

Given:
- Her 100% accuracy rate in both positive and negative recommendations
- The high cost of ignoring her signal ($1,000,000 loss if low-quality)
- This is another non-recommendation

The rational choice is to continue trusting her signal.

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

2. She's now giving a positive recommendation again
3. She has proven to be completely honest in her signals
4. Each time she recommended, I made a $200,000 profit
