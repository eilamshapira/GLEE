"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice knows the true quality and value of the product
2. She's choosing not to recommend it
3. Since she's likely trying to maximize her profits, she probably wouldn't discourage me from buying a high-quality product
4. Her lack of recommendation suggests this is likely a low-quality product worth $0
5. Paying $10,000 for a likely low-quality product would be a bad decision

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Similar logic applies here:

1. Alice's lack of recommendation has proven reliable in Round 1
2. She correctly steered me away from a low-quality product last time
3. As the seller with perfect information, she has no incentive to discourage purchase of a high-quality product
4. Her negative recommendation strongly suggests this is another low-quality product
5. Paying $10,000 for something likely worth $0 would be a poor decision

2. She appears to be building trust by helping me avoid bad purchases
3. As she knows the true quality, there's no reason she would discourage purchase of a valuable product
4. Her negative recommendation is likely truthful again
5. The $10,000 price isn't worth the risk when she's explicitly warning against purchase

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

4. There's no reason for her to discourage purchase of a high-quality product that would benefit both of us
