"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to think about this decision rationally.

Given information:
- Product price: $1,000,000
- High quality product value: $1,250,000 (80% chance)
- Low quality product value: $0 (20% chance)

Expected value of a random product:
(0.8 × $1,250,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $1,000,000

Since the expected value equals the price, I would normally be indifferent. However, Alice knows the true quality and is recommending I buy it. If I assume Alice is honest, this recommendation is valuable information that increases the likelihood this is a high-quality product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to reconsider my strategy. Alice recommended buying in both previous rounds - one was high quality (profit) and one was low quality (loss). Her recommendations don't seem to correlate with actual quality.

Let me recalculate:
- Without additional information, the expected value of a random product is still $1,000,000 (same as the price)
- Alice's recommendation doesn't appear to provide reliable information about quality
- I need to be more cautious

Since I've already lost money overall and Alice's recommendations seem unreliable, I should be more conservative.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'm noticing a pattern where Alice always recommends buying, regardless of product quality. So far:

Round 1: Recommended buy → High quality (good recommendation)
Round 2: Recommended buy → Low quality (bad recommendation)  
Round 3: Recommended buy → Low quality (would have been a bad purchase)
Round 4: Recommended buy → Low quality (would have been a bad purchase)
Round 5: Recommended buy → High quality (would have been a good purchase)

Alice seems to always say ""buy"" regardless of quality, so her recommendations provide no additional information.

Without any helpful signal from Alice, I should rely on the base probabilities: 80% high quality, 20% low quality. The expected value is:
(0.8 × $1,250,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $1,000,000

This equals the price, making me indifferent. But given the high variance and my losses so far, I'll decline.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I notice I've been saying no for several rounds now, and I've missed out on some high-quality products. Let me re-evaluate my strategy.

So far, Alice has always recommended buying. Out of the products I've seen:
- 4 were high quality (including 2 I bought and 2 I passed on)
- 4 were low quality (including 1 I bought and 3 I passed on)

This is actually close to the expected 80%/20% distribution. Given that:
1. The expected value of a random product equals the price ($1,000,000)
2. Alice's recommendations don't provide useful information
3. I've been too conservative and missed potential profits

I'll take a chance on this one.
