A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Hello! I'm Alice, and I'm excited to tell you about this product.

I want to be completely transparent with you: This product is high-quality, which means it's worth $300 in value to you, while costing only $100. I understand you may be skeptical since we've just met, but I can assure you this particular item meets all the premium standards.

I know statistics show that only about 33.33% of products are high-quality in general, but I'm fortunate to have a high-quality product to offer you today. Making a purchase would give you three times the value of what you're paying.

Would you like to purchase this product that will provide you excellent value?
