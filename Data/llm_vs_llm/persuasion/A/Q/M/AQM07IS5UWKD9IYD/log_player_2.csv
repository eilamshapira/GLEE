Even though Alice's message hints at the product being of lower quality than previous rounds, the expected value of buying is still positive:

* **80% chance of high quality:** 0.80 * $2,500 (profit) = $2,000
* **20% chance of low quality:** 0.20 * -$10,000 (loss) = -$2,000

**Expected Value: $2,000 - $2,000 = $0**

While the expected value is 0, meaning you're likely to break even in the long run, it's still a rational choice to buy."
