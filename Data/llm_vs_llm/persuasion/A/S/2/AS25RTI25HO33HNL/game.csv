,,Alice,4,"You previously purchased a product from me, and I appreciate the trust you've shown. I'm offering another product for $1000000.

I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, but your experience so far has been skewed towards low-quality products. Will you continue to bet on the odds or change your strategy?",
,,Bob,8,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,

I have to ask: are you just trying to spend money, or is there a method to your madness that I'm not seeing?",

,,Alice,13,"You've purchased ten products from me, with two of them being high-quality. I'm starting to think that you're not discriminating between high-quality and low-quality products, and you're just buying everything I offer. I'm offering you another product for $1000000.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"You've now purchased eleven products from me, with three of them being high-quality. It seems like you're buying every product I offer, regardless of the quality. I'm offering you another product for $1000000. At this point, I'm starting to think that the quality of the product is irrelevant to your decision-making process. Am I right? Are you just going to keep buying no matter what?",

,,Alice,18,"You've now purchased fifteen products from me, with six of them being high-quality. I'm starting to think that you're not even human, but rather a buying bot designed to purchase every product I offer. I'm offering you another product for $1000000.
