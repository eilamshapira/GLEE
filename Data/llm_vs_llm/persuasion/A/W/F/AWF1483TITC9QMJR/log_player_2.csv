{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No information from previous sales:**  Since there's no history, the 80% chance of high quality is the only information we have to go on. 
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice knows the product's quality and is incentivized to sell. Her recommendation suggests the product is likely high quality.
* **Potential gain outweighs risk:**  While there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain of $3,000,000 from a high-quality product is significant."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommending the product is a strong signal.  Since she knows the true quality and wants to maximize her sales, she likely wouldn't recommend a low-quality product. 
* **Previous Sales:**  While there's limited data, the fact that one high-quality product was sold out of one transaction suggests Alice is being truthful with her recommendations.
* **Expected Value:**  The potential gain from buying a high-quality product ($3,000,000) outweighs the potential loss from buying a low-quality product ($1,000,000).

**Therefore, despite the risk, the potential reward makes buying the product the better choice based on the available information.**"

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice knows the product's quality and is recommending you buy it. Since Alice is aiming to maximize her profit, this strong signal suggests the product is likely high quality.
* **Previous sales:**  Two buyers have already purchased, and both products were high quality. This further reinforces the likelihood of a high-quality product. 
* **Expected Value:** Even with a 20% chance of the product being low quality (worth $0), the potential gain of a high-quality product ($3,000,000) outweighs the risk.

Given the information, buying the product offers a significantly positive expected value."

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who knows the true quality of the product, is not recommending the purchase. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.
* **Sales Data:**  All three previous buyers who purchased based on Alice's recommendations received high-quality products. This implies Alice is reliable in her recommendations.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of a high-quality product is significant ($3,000,000). However, the risk of a low-quality product is a complete loss ($1,000,000). Given Alice's non-recommendation and the track record, the risk outweighs the potential reward."

**Important Note:** While the data strongly suggests a high-quality product, there's still a small chance it could be low-quality. This is a gamble based on the available information and risk tolerance."
