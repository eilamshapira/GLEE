Let's quickly review the situation so far:

- You have bought 2 products, both of which were high-quality.
- Each product cost you $10,000, and each high-quality product is worth $12,500 to you.
- Therefore, you have spent a total of $20,000 and gained $25,000 in value.
- Your net gain so far is $5,000.
