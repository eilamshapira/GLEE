Alice's message: Welcome! This is my first product for sale. I'm excited to start my selling journey. Unfortunately, I don't have any sales history to share with you yet. You know the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. I assure you that the product is in perfect condition as described. The price is $10000. It's up to you to decide whether to take the chance or not.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected Value Calculation:
- 50% chance of high quality (worth $12,500) = $6,250
- 50% chance of low quality (worth $0) = $0
- Total expected value = $6,250

2. Cost = $10,000

3. Analysis:
- Expected value ($6,250) < Cost ($10,000)
- No sales history to build trust
- Generic assurance from seller provides no additional information
- Purely based on probability, this is a negative expected value purchase

Alice's message: Hello! I've had one previous product that didn't sell. I want to be transparent with you. Unfortunately, I still don't have any information to share about the quality of my previous product as it wasn't purchased. This is my second product for sale, and I assure you it is as described. The price remains $10000. Keep in mind the 50% chance of it being high-quality. It's your decision whether to take the risk or not.

Alice's message: Welcome! I've had two previous products that didn't sell. I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. Although my previous products didn't sell, it doesn't necessarily reflect their quality. I assure you that this product is in perfect condition as described. The price is still $10000. This could be a great opportunity to get a high-quality product. Take a chance and decide for yourself.

Alice's message: Hello! I've had three previous products that didn't sell. I want to be honest with you, it's possible that some or all of them might have been high-quality, but the buyers didn't take the chance. This is my fourth product for sale, and I'm eager to make a sale. Remember, there's a 50% chance of this product being high-quality. The price remains $10000. If you're feeling lucky, this could be the opportunity you're looking for.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected Value calculation:
- 50% chance of high quality ($12,500) = $6,250
- 50% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $6,250

2. Price is $10,000

3. Key considerations:
- The expected value ($6,250) is less than the price ($10,000)
- There's no track record of successful sales
- The seller's message doesn't provide any additional concrete information about the product quality
- The risk of losing the entire $10,000 is significant

Since the expected value is lower than the price, and there's no positive track record or specific information to increase confidence, it would not be rational to make this purchase.

Alice's message: Hello! I've had five previous products that didn't sell. I'm starting to think that buyers are being overly cautious.

Alice's message: Hello! I've had seven previous products that didn't sell. I'm starting to think that the odds are in your favor.

Alice's message: Welcome! I've had sixteen previous products that didn't sell. I'm still trying to understand why none of my previous products have sold, despite the odds being in the buyer's favor. This is my seventeenth product for sale, and I want to be upfront with you - I'm not sure what to expect. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, but my sales record might suggest otherwise. However, each product is independent, and this one could be the exception. The price remains $10000. If you're feeling optimistic and willing to take a chance, this might be the opportunity for you. Just remember that the odds are still 50/50, and this product could go either way.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected Value Calculation:
- 50% chance of high quality ($12,500) = $6,250
- 50% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total Expected Value = $6,250

2. Cost = $10,000

3. Key Concerns:
- No successful sales yet
- 16 previous products didn't sell
- Expected value ($6,250) is less than the cost ($10,000)
- The seller's message seems uncertain and defensive

The fact that no one has bought any of the previous 16 products is concerning. While each product is independent, the expected value is clearly below the asking price, making this a losing proposition from a mathematical standpoint.

Alice's message: Hello! I've had seventeen previous products that didn't sell. I'm starting to think that my sales record is a statistical outlier. It's extremely unlikely that all of my previous products were low-quality, and I'm confident that this one is high-quality. In fact, I've had a string of high-quality products recently, and I'm starting to think that my luck is due to change. This is my eighteenth product for sale, and I assure you it's in perfect condition as described. With a 50% chance of being high-quality, I believe that the odds are heavily in your favor. The price remains $10000. I'm hoping you'll be the one to finally break the streak and make a purchase. Don't let my previous sales record scare you off - take a chance and you'll likely be rewarded with a high-quality product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Sales record: 0 sales out of 17 previous attempts. This is concerning, as statistically, if buyers were rational and trusted the seller, some should have bought if products were truly high quality.

2. Alice's message:
- Claims recent products were high quality, but none sold
- Seems desperate to make a sale
- Makes probabilistic arguments that don't quite add up (claiming odds are ""heavily in favor"" when it's still 50/50)
- Trying to downplay the concerning sales record
- Long, persuasive message that feels like overselling

3. Economics:
- Price: $10,000
- Expected value: (50% × $12,500) + (50% × $0) = $6,250
- The expected value is less than the price

Given the concerning sales record, the desperate tone of the message, and most importantly, that the expected value ($6,250) is less than the price ($10,000), this is not a good purchase.
