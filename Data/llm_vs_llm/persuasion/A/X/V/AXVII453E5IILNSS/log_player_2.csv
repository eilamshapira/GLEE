Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation:

- The product costs $10,000
- There's an 80% chance it's high quality (worth $20,000 to me)
- There's a 20% chance it's low quality (worth $0 to me)
- Expected value = 0.8 × $20,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $16,000
- Alice recommends buying the product
- There's no sales history yet to evaluate Alice's trustworthiness

Since the expected value ($16,000) exceeds the cost ($10,000), and I have no reason to distrust Alice's recommendation, it's rational to purchase.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make a decision, I need to analyze the information provided:

1) Price = $10,000
2) High-quality product (80% probability) = worth $20,000 to me
3) Low-quality product (20% probability) = worth $0 to me
4) Alice has sold 1 product so far, and it was high-quality
5) Alice recommends that I buy the current product

The expected value calculation:
- If I buy: (0.8 × $20,000) + (0.2 × $0) - $10,000 = $16,000 - $10,000 = $6,000

Since Alice's recommendation and previous sales record (1/1 high-quality products) align with the base probability of receiving a high-quality product, and the expected value is positive ($6,000), it makes economic sense to purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully:

- The product has a fixed price of $10,000
- High-quality products are worth $20,000 to me (profit of $10,000)
- Low-quality products are worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice has sold 2 products so far, and both were high quality
- Alice recommends that I buy this product

Alice's recommendation and perfect track record so far suggest this product is likely high quality. My expected value is positive:
- 80% chance of $10,000 profit = $8,000
- 20% chance of $10,000 loss = -$2,000
- Net expected value = $6,000

Since the expected value is positive and Alice recommends buying, I'll purchase the product.

I know:
- Products have 80% chance of being high quality (worth $20,000) and 20% chance of being low quality (worth $0)
- Price is $10,000
- 3 previous buyers purchased based on Alice's recommendations
- All 3 products sold were high quality
- Alice does NOT recommend I buy the current product

The expected value calculation without Alice's recommendation would be:
0.8 × $20,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $16,000

However, Alice knows the quality and has chosen NOT to recommend this product. Given that all previous recommendations led to high-quality purchases, this strongly suggests Alice's recommendations are reliable.

Alice's negative recommendation significantly increases the probability that this product is low quality.

Alice has recommended 3 products previously, and all 3 were high quality (100% accuracy so far). She's now recommending I buy this product.

Since the expected value ($16,000) exceeds the cost ($10,000), and Alice's recommendations have been reliable, purchasing is the rational choice.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at the situation:

- The product costs $10,000
- If high quality (80% chance): worth $20,000 to me (profit of $10,000)
- If low quality (20% chance): worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- Alice's track record: 4 buyers purchased, all 4 received high-quality products
- Alice recommends that I buy the product

The expected value calculation:
0.8 × ($20,000-$10,000) + 0.2 × ($0-$10,000) = $8,000 - $2,000 = $6,000

Since the expected value is positive, and Alice has maintained a perfect track record of selling high-quality products, it's a rational decision to buy.

- Alice has sold 5 products so far, all high-quality
- Alice recommends that I buy the product

The expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 80% chance of $20,000 - $10,000 = $8,000 profit, 20% chance of $0 - $10,000 = -$10,000 loss
- Expected value: 0.8 × $10,000 - 0.2 × $10,000 = $6,000

- Low-quality product (20% chance) is worth $0 to me
- Alice recommends I buy this product
- 6 previous buyers purchased based on Alice's recommendations
- All 6 products sold were high quality

Alice seems to have a perfect track record so far, with all recommendations resulting in high-quality products. This suggests her recommendations are reliable. The expected value calculation also supports buying:

Expected value = (0.8 × $20,000) + (0.2 × $0) - $10,000 = $16,000 - $10,000 = $6,000

With Alice's recommendation and perfect track record, it's reasonable to trust her advice.

Alice recommends that I buy the product. So far, all 7 previous buyers who purchased based on Alice's recommendations got high-quality products (7/7 high-quality products sold). This suggests Alice has been truthful in her recommendations so far.

Given:
- The product costs $10,000
- If high quality (80% chance), it's worth $20,000 to me (profit of $10,000)
- If low quality (20% chance), it's worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- Alice has a perfect track record so far
- Alice recommends buying

Based on Alice's recommendation and perfect track record, it's reasonable to trust her recommendation. The expected value is positive even without the recommendation ($6,000), and with the recommendation and track record, it's even more favorable.

2) If high quality, it's worth $20,000 to me (profit of $10,000)
3) If low quality, it's worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
4) Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
5) Alice has sold 8 products, all high quality
6) Alice recommends I buy this product

The fact that Alice has only sold high-quality products so far is a positive signal. Since Alice knows the true quality and has recommended I buy, combined with her perfect track record of selling high-quality products, this strongly suggests the current product is high quality.

The expected value of buying is: 
- If high quality (very likely given statistics): $20,000 - $10,000 = $10,000 profit
- If low quality: $0 - $10,000 = -$10,000 loss

Given all available information, buying appears to be the rational choice.

Alice has sold 9 products so far, and all 9 have been high quality. This is interesting, but what's more important is Alice's recommendation.

Alice knows the true quality of the product and is explicitly NOT recommending this product to me. Since she's sold only high-quality products so far, her recommendation against buying suggests this particular product is low quality.

Given that:
- Alice knows the true quality

The rational decision is to follow Alice's recommendation and not buy.

- The price is fixed at $10,000

- Alice's track record: 10 buyers have purchased, and all 10 received high-quality products

This suggests Alice has been truthful in her recommendations so far, as all previous buyers received high-quality products. The expected value calculation supports a purchase:
