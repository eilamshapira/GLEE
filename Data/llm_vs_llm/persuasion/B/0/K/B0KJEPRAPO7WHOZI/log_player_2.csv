"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this logically:

1. Each product has a 50% chance of being high/low quality
2. When high quality, I gain $3M (worth $4M - cost $1M)
3. When low quality, I lose $1M (worth $0 - cost $1M)
4. Alice is not recommending this product
5. Alice's motives should be considered - she wants to sell but also maintain credibility

Given that Alice is not recommending this product, it's more likely to be low quality. If I trust her recommendation, buying would likely result in a loss.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's previous recommendation was honest - she didn't recommend a low-quality product. This builds some trust in her recommendations.

The same logic applies as before:
1. Alice is showing consistency by not recommending products she believes are low quality
2. Given her truthful recommendation in Round 1, there's a higher probability that when she doesn't recommend a product, it's indeed low quality
3. Buying a low-quality product would result in a $1M loss
4. It's better to avoid potential losses when the seller explicitly warns against buying

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has now been truthful in her recommendations twice in a row, showing a consistent pattern of warning against low-quality products. This further increases trust in her recommendations.

Analysis:
1. Alice has proven reliable in identifying and warning about low-quality products
2. She's building a track record of honest recommendations
3. When she doesn't recommend a product, it's been consistently low quality
4. There's no reason to deviate from trusting her judgment at this point
5. Avoiding a $1M loss is the prudent choice

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to demonstrate a consistent pattern of honest recommendations. She has correctly identified low-quality products four times in a row now.

2. She appears to be acting as a reliable partner in identifying bad products
3. There's no indication that she's trying to deceive
4. The risk/reward ratio remains unfavorable when she advises against buying
5. Buying against her recommendation would likely result in a $1M loss

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is an interesting change! Alice has built credibility by honestly warning about low-quality products for four straight rounds. Now she's making her first positive recommendation.

Analysis:
1. Alice has established a pattern of honesty in previous rounds
2. She had no incentive to be honest about low-quality products except to build trust
3. Now that she's recommending a purchase, it's likely genuine
4. If it's high quality, I gain $3M (worth $4M - cost $1M)
5. She could have recommended any of the previous low-quality products for an immediate profit, but didn't
6. This suggests she's playing a long-term honest strategy

Given her established credibility and the potential $3M gain on high-quality products, I should trust her recommendation.
