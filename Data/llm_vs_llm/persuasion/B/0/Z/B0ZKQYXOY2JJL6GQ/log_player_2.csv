"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this decision.

Alice recommends buying the product, but I need to determine if that recommendation is valuable or not.

In general, the expected value of a random product is:
- 80% chance of high quality: 0.8 × $2,000,000 = $1,600,000
- 20% chance of low quality: 0.2 × $0 = $0
Total expected value: $1,600,000

Since the price is $1,000,000, the expected profit is $1,600,000 - $1,000,000 = $600,000, which is positive.

At this early stage, I don't have evidence that Alice's recommendations are biased one way or another, so I should go with the expected value calculation.
