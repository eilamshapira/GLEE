1. Past record:
- 3 buyers purchased products
- All 3 products were high-quality (100% success rate)
- This shows a consistent track record

2. Alice's claim:
- She claims this product is high-quality
- Her past behavior shows honesty (3/3 high-quality)

3. Economics:
- If high-quality: Gain = $1,200,000 - $1,000,000 = $200,000
- If low-quality: Loss = $0 - $1,000,000 = -$1,000,000
- Base probability is 50/50

4. Trust factor:
- Perfect track record so far
- Explicit quality verification claim
- Strong alignment between past actions and current claims

Given Alice's perfect track record and explicit verification claim, combined with the potential gain, this appears to be a reasonable risk.
