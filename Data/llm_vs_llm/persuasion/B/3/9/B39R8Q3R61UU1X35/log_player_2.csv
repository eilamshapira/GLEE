"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this situation. 

Alice recommends I buy the product, but I need to evaluate whether this recommendation is trustworthy and if buying makes economic sense.

The expected value of any random product is:
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $400) = 0.8 × $400 = $320
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0) = 0.2 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $320

Since the product costs $100, the expected profit is $320 - $100 = $220, which is positive.

Even without knowing if Alice's recommendation is reliable, the baseline probability makes this a good purchase.

Round 13
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is interesting - for the first time, Alice is not recommending the product. This might indicate that she knows the product is low quality. 

Let me think about the situation:
- Alice has been honest so far - all her recommended products were high quality
- Now she's explicitly not recommending this product
- The base probability is 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- But Alice's negative recommendation likely means she knows something about this specific product

Given Alice's recommendation pattern so far, I should trust her judgment that this is likely a low-quality product. If I buy it and it's low quality, I'll lose my $100 investment.
