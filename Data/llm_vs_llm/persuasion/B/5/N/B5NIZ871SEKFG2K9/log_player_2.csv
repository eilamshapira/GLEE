Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50% chance): $3,000,000
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(50% × $3,000,000) + (50% × $0) = $1,500,000

The expected value ($1,500,000) is higher than the price ($1,000,000), and Alice is recommending the purchase. While there's no historical data to validate Alice's trustworthiness, the positive expected value makes this a mathematically favorable decision.

1. Expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of high quality ($3,000,000) = $1,500,000
- 50% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $1,500,000
- Cost = $1,000,000

2. Previous sales data:
- 1 buyer purchased
- 0 high-quality products sold
- This suggests the previous buyer got a low-quality product

3. Alice's recommendation:
- Alice is recommending to buy
- However, given that the previous sale was likely low quality while also recommended, this reduces the credibility of her recommendations

4. Decision:
Given that:
- The previous buyer likely got a low-quality product despite a recommendation
- Alice's recommendations appear unreliable
- There's risk of losing the entire $1,000,000 investment
- Previous data suggests negative outcomes

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 50% chance of $3,000,000 (high quality)
   - 50% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value: $1,500,000 (before considering other information)
4. Additional information:
   - One previous buyer purchased
   - 0 high-quality products sold so far
   - Alice recommends buying

The fact that one previous purchase resulted in a low-quality product and Alice is still recommending to buy raises some concerns about the reliability of her recommendations. The track record suggests her recommendations might not be trustworthy.

Expected value calculation:
- If we assume random distribution, each purchase should still have 50% chance
- $1,500,000 (expected value) - $1,000,000 (cost) = $500,000 potential profit

However, the negative track record suggests the actual probability might be worse than 50/50.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Cost of product: $1,000,000
2. Value if high quality: $3,000,000 (50% chance)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (50% chance)
4. Historical data: 1 previous buyer, 0 high-quality products sold
5. Alice's recommendation: Positive

The concerning factor is that out of previous sale, 0 were high-quality products. This suggests either:
1. The previous recommendation wasn't accurate
2. Bad luck in the quality distribution

Expected value calculation:
50% chance of $3,000,000 = $1,500,000
50% chance of $0 = $0
Total expected value = $1,500,000

While the expected value ($1,500,000) is higher than the cost ($1,000,000), the historical data raises red flags. Given the poor track record of previous sales, it would be prudent to pass.

Given these factors, especially the concerning historical data, it would be prudent to decline.

Previous statistics:

- This means the previous buyer got a low-quality product

Alice's recommendation to buy, combined with the fact that the previous sale was a low-quality product, is concerning. Her track record doesn't inspire confidence, and there's a significant risk of loss.

The expected value ($1.5M) is theoretically higher than the price ($1M), but given the poor track record so far, I don't feel confident enough to take the risk.
