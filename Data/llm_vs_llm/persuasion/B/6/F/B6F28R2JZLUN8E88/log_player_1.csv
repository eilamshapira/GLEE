Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Before we proceed, let's analyze the situation. The buyer is aware that there is a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product and a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product. Given the current statistics (3 products sold, 2 of which are high-quality), the buyer might be inclined to think that the probability is in their favor.

However, recommending a product solely based on its quality in each round might not be the best strategy. Instead, consider the long-term perception of your reliability. If you recommend buying every time, regardless of the product's quality, buyers might start to distrust your recommendations, especially if they end up with low-quality products multiple times.

Given that this round's product is high-quality, recommending it would align with the buyer's expectations based on the known probabilities. However, it's crucial to maintain a balanced approach to preserve trust over the 20 rounds.

For this round, since the product is high-quality:
