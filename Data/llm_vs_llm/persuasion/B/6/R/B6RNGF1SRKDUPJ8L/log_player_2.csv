Alice's message: I'm offering a product today that I'm confident you'll find valuable. While I can't guarantee it will meet every single expectation, I believe the price represents a fair exchange for the potential benefits it offers. Consider the possibilities and decide if it's right for you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price point: $100
2. Potential outcomes:
   - 80% chance of high quality (worth $400) = Expected value of $320
   - 20% chance of low quality (worth $0) = Expected value of $0
3. Total expected value: $320
4. Cost: $100
5. Expected net gain: $320 - $100 = $220

Since the expected value ($320) is significantly higher than the cost ($100), and the expected net gain is positive ($220), this is a mathematically favorable decision. Even with no previous sales history, the base probability of 80% high quality makes this a rational investment.

Alice's message: I have a product available today that offers a unique opportunity. While I can't disclose all the details upfront, I encourage you to consider its potential value and how it might benefit you. At this price, it's worth taking a chance on something new.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Prior statistics:
- Only 1 buyer so far, who bought the product
- 0 high-quality products sold
- This means the previous sale was a low-quality product

2. Alice's message:
- Seems vague and non-committal
- Doesn't provide any concrete information about quality
- Uses persuasive language without substance

3. Risk assessment:
- Product costs $100
- 80% chance of getting $400 value (good)
- 20% chance of getting $0 value (bad)
- Expected value = (0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) - $100 = $220

However, the fact that the previous sale was low quality and Alice's vague message are concerning red flags. Since Alice knows the true quality, her ambiguous message suggests this might be another low-quality product.

Alice's message: I'm offering a product today with a strong potential for high value. Based on my experience, I believe it's a worthwhile investment at this price point. While past performance isn't a guarantee, I'm confident you'll be satisfied with your purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this carefully:

1. Prior probability: 80% chance of high quality, 20% chance of low quality
2. Current sales record: 1 buyer, 0 high-quality products sold
3. This suggests the previous sale was a low-quality product
4. Alice's message seems positive but generic
5. Expected value calculation:
   * 80% chance of $400 value = $320
   * 20% chance of $0 value = $0
   * Total expected value = $320
   * Price = $100

Even though the previous sale was likely low quality, the base probability of 80% high quality and the positive expected value ($320 > $100) make this a mathematically sound investment.

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: $400 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
3. Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
4. Past sales data:
   - 2 buyers purchased
   - Only 1 high-quality product sold
   - This means 1 buyer got a low-quality product
5. This track record is concerning as it's worse than the base 80% probability

Despite Alice's confident recommendation, the historical data shows a 50% success rate (1 out of 2), which is significantly worse than the expected 80%. This suggests either bad luck or potentially misleading recommendations.

Given the poor track record and the risk of losing $100, I'll decline this offer.

2. Past sales data:

- 1 high-quality product confirmed
- 1 unknown or low-quality product
- 50% known success rate

3. Decision factors:
- Expected value ($320) is significantly higher than price ($100)
- The sales track record isn't great (50% confirmed high quality)
- Alice's message is positive but vague
- Base probability of high quality (80%) is favorable

2. Past Performance:
- 3 buyers so far

- This means 2/3 (66.7%) of sold products were high quality
- While this is slightly below the base rate of 80%, the sample size is too small to be very meaningful

3. Alice's Message:
