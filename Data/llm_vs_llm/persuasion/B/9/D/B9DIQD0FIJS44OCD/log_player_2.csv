Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Possible values:
   * High quality (50% chance): $12,000
   * Low quality (50% chance): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   * (50% × $12,000) + (50% × $0) = $6,000

4. Alice's recommendation: Buy
   * However, Alice has incentive to always recommend buying since she profits regardless of quality
   * No previous sales history to establish trust

5. Decision factors:
   * Expected value ($6,000) is less than price ($10,000)
   * No track record to verify Alice's honesty
   * Risk of complete loss ($10,000) if product is low quality

Given that the expected value is lower than the price, and there's no historical data to trust Alice's recommendation, it would be economically unwise to buy.

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50%): $12,000
   - Low quality (50%): $0

3. Expected value = (0.5 × $12,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $6,000

4. Alice recommends buying, but:
   - No track record to verify her trustworthiness
   - She knows the true quality
   - She has an incentive to sell regardless of quality

Since the expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000), and there's no historical data to trust Alice's recommendation, it would be rational to decline.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The price is $10,000
2. The product has:
   - 50% chance of being worth $12,000 (profit of $2,000)
   - 50% chance of being worth $0 (loss of $10,000)
3. Alice recommends buying
4. No prior sales history to evaluate Alice's trustworthiness

Expected value without considering Alice's recommendation:
(50% × $12,000) + (50% × $0) = $6,000

Since the expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000), and there's no sales history to establish Alice's credibility, it would be risky to buy.

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - 50% chance of $12,000 (high quality)

3. Expected value = (0.5 × $12,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $6,000

The expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000), which makes this a losing proposition on average. Even though Alice recommends buying the product, without any track record of her honesty or reliability in recommendations, it would be risky to trust this recommendation.

4. Alice knows the true quality and recommends buying
   - However, Alice's incentive is to sell regardless of quality
   - No track record to evaluate Alice's honesty

While Alice recommends buying, I have no historical data to trust this recommendation. The expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000), making this a negative expected value decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product cost: $10,000
2. Value if high quality: $12,000 (profit: $2,000)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss: $10,000)
4. Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
5. Alice's recommendation: Buy

Expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of $2,000 profit = $1,000
- 50% chance of $10,000 loss = -$5,000
Base expected value = -$4,000

Since Alice knows the true quality and recommends buying, this could be a positive signal. However, we don't have any historical data to verify Alice's trustworthiness in recommendations. Without knowing if Alice's interests align with buyers, the recommendation alone isn't enough to overcome the negative expected value.
