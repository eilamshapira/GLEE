"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this decision.

In this game, Alice is offering products for $1,000,000. Each product has:
- 33.33% chance of being high quality (worth $1,200,000 to me)
- 66.67% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me)

Alice knows the true quality of each product and is giving me a recommendation. In Round 1, she recommends I buy the product.

The expected value of a random product is:
(0.3333 × $1,200,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $400,000

Since the price is $1,000,000, the expected value is less than the price.

Without knowing more about Alice's incentives or strategy, I should assume she might recommend buying even low-quality products since she profits either way. Her recommendation alone doesn't provide enough information to overcome the negative expected value.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to reconsider my strategy. Alice has recommended buying 4 times so far, and 3 of those were actually high quality products. This suggests her recommendations may be honest.

If I trust Alice's recommendations, then when she recommends buying, the product is likely high quality (worth $1,200,000), which exceeds the $1,000,000 price.

Given this pattern, I should consider changing my strategy.
