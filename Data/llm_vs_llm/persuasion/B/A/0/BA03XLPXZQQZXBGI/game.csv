,,Alice,5,"Hello! I'm glad to have you consider my product. I want to be upfront with you - my sales record is now 1 out of 4 products sold, and that one was a high-quality product. The buyer who purchased it was able to get a great deal, and I'm hoping to find another buyer who will appreciate the value of my products. Although the odds are still 50% for any given product, I want to caution you that my current streak might not be indicative of the quality of this specific product. That being said, the price of $1000000 remains the same, and if you're willing to take the chance, you could potentially get a high-quality product at a great price.",
