Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50%): $30,000
   - Low quality (50%): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (50% × $30,000) + (50% × $0) = $15,000

4. Alice's recommendation: Buy
   - However, Alice might have an incentive to always recommend buying since she profits from sales

5. No prior sales history to evaluate Alice's trustworthiness

The expected value ($15,000) is higher than the price ($10,000), suggesting a positive expected return of $5,000. Even without historical data to verify Alice's credibility, the mathematics favor making the purchase.

1. Previous statistics:
- 1 buyer before me
- 1 product sold
- 1 high-quality product sold (100% success rate so far)

2. Current situation:
- Product price: $10,000
- If high quality: worth $30,000 (profit: $20,000)
- If low quality: worth $0 (loss: $10,000)
- Alice doesn't recommend buying

3. Key considerations:
- Alice has been honest so far (100% high-quality sales)
- Alice explicitly recommends NOT buying
- Alice knows the true value to me
- Since Alice appears trustworthy and has no incentive to lie, her negative recommendation is likely honest

Given Alice's negative recommendation and her track record of honesty, it's most likely this is a low-quality product. I should trust her recommendation.

3. Current statistics:

   - 1 purchase made
   - 1 high-quality product sold
4. Alice's recommendation: Negative

Alice has been honest so far (1/1 high-quality sales), but she's explicitly recommending against buying this product. Given that she knows the true quality and has shown honesty in previous transactions, her negative recommendation is likely truthful.

Therefore, I will follow Alice's recommendation.

3. Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
4. Previous sales data:
   - 1 buyer before me
   - 1 high-quality product sold
5. Alice doesn't recommend buying

Alice's track record shows she has only sold high-quality products so far (1/1), which is positive. However, her negative recommendation for this specific product is particularly telling since:
1. She knows the true quality
2. She knows the value to me
3. She has demonstrated honesty by selling only high-quality products before

Given that Alice doesn't recommend buying and has shown trustworthiness in previous sales, this strongly suggests the current product is low quality.

The previous sale being high quality and Alice's recommendation are positive signals. Since Alice knows the true quality and has demonstrated honesty with the previous buyer, her recommendation carries weight. The expected value is positive given these signals.

- Base probability: 50% for each quality level

3. Seller's behavior:
- Alice has been honest so far (2/2 high-quality products)
- Alice is recommending this product
- Alice knows the true value to me

Given the perfect track record and Alice's recommendation, this seems like a positive expected value decision. The previous sales suggest Alice is being truthful in her recommendations.

- If high quality (unlikely): Pay $10,000 for something worth $30,000 = Gain of $20,000
