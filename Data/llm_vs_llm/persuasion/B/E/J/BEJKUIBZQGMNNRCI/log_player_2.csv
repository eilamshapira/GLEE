Alice's message: Hello! I'm offering a fantastic product today that I'm confident you'll find valuable. While I can't offer guarantees, I can tell you that I strive to provide high-quality items. Given that 80% of my products are high-quality, I believe this is a great opportunity at just $100. It's a worthwhile investment!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this rationally:

1. Product price: $100
2. If high quality (80% chance): Worth $120 (profit of $20)
3. If low quality (20% chance): Worth $0 (loss of $100)

Expected value calculation:
* (0.8 × $120) + (0.2 × $0) - $100 = $96 - $100 = -$4

While Alice's message is positive, I have no prior sales data to verify her reliability. The expected value is slightly negative (-$4), suggesting that purely from a mathematical standpoint, the purchase is not favorable.

Alice's message: Good day! I have a product available for $100. My customers generally have a positive experience with my products. Don't miss out on the chance to own this item!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Prior probability:
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $120)
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)

2. Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $120) + (0.2 × $0) = $96

3. Considerations:
- No sales history to verify Alice's claims
- The expected value ($96) is less than the price ($100)
- There's no specific information about this particular product's quality

Given that the expected value ($96) is less than the asking price ($100), and there's no sales history to verify the seller's reliability, it would not be rational to make the purchase.

4. Expected value calculation:
   * (0.8 × $120) + (0.2 × $0) = $96

The expected value ($96) is less than the price ($100), and Alice's message is generic without specific information about the product's quality. Also, there's no track record to evaluate her reliability.

Alice's message: Greetings! I am offering a product for $100 today. Previous buyers have generally been satisfied, and I believe you will be too. It's a good opportunity to get something useful. Give it a try!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product value:
- High quality (80% chance): Worth $120 (profit of $20)
- Low quality (20% chance): Worth $0 (loss of $100)

2. Past performance:
- 1 previous buyer
- 1 high-quality product sold
- 100% success rate so far

3. Expected value calculation:
(80% × $120) + (20% × $0) - $100 = $96 - $100 = -$4

Although Alice has a perfect track record so far, the sample size is very small (just one sale). The expected value calculation shows a slightly negative result (-$4), and Alice's message is quite generic without specific quality information.

Given the small negative expected value and limited historical data, I'll err on the side of caution.

Alice's message: Hi! I have a product for sale at $100. I focus on offering good value, and I think you'll find this worthwhile. Many customers are happy with their purchases!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Cost vs. Value:
- Product cost: $100
- Value if high quality: $120 (20% profit)
- Value if low quality: $0 (complete loss)
- Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality

2. Previous Sales Data:
- 1 buyer so far
- 1 high-quality product sold
- 100% success rate so far

3. Expected Value Calculation:
With 80% chance of high quality:
EV = (0.8 × $120) + (0.2 × $0) - $100
EV = $96 - $100 = -$4

Based on both the prior probability and the sales history showing positive outcomes, plus Alice's confident recommendation, this seems like a reasonable purchase. However, the expected value calculation shows a slight negative return, suggesting caution.

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (80% chance): $120 (profit of $20)
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0 (loss of $100)

3. Previous sales data:
   - 1 buyer so far
   - 1 high-quality product sold
   - 100% success rate with previous sale

4. Expected value calculation:
   (80% × $120) + (20% × $0) - $100 = $96 - $100 = -$4

The historical data is positive but limited. While the prior sale was successful, one transaction isn't enough to establish a reliable pattern. The expected value calculation shows a slight negative (-$4), and Alice's message is generic without specific quality information.

Given the uncertainty and slightly negative expected value, I'll be cautious.

- 80% chance of high quality (worth $120) = 0.8 × $120 = $96
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0) = 0.2 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $96
- Price = $100

2. Sales history:
- One previous buyer
- One high-quality product sold
- This matches the expected quality ratio (80% high quality)

3. Risk assessment:
- Expected value ($96) is less than the price ($100)
- Even with the positive sales history, the expected value doesn't justify the price
- There's still a 20% chance of getting a worthless product

Given that the expected value ($96) is less than the price ($100), it would not be rational to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $120) = 0.8 × $120 = $96
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0) = 0.2 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $96

2. Previous sales data:
- Only one previous buyer
- One high-quality product sold
- This suggests Alice is being honest about product quality

3. Price:
- Fixed price of $100
- Expected value ($96) is less than the price ($100)

Since the expected value ($96) is less than the price ($100), and there isn't enough historical data to establish a strong pattern of reliability, it would not be rational to buy.

3. Previous sales:
   - 1 buyer before me
   - 1 high-quality product sold
   - 100% success rate so far

The historical data shows a perfect track record, though with a small sample size. The base probability of 80% for high quality is good, and the previous sale being high quality slightly reinforces this.

Expected value calculation:
0.8 × $120 + 0.2 × $0 = $96

While the expected value ($96) is slightly below the price ($100), the seller's perfect track record and positive messaging provide some additional confidence.

1. Prior statistics:
- 2 buyers so far

3. Expected value calculation:

4. Additional factors:
- Alice's perfect track record so far is positive
- However, the expected value ($96) is still less than the price ($100)
- The sample size (2 previous sales) is too small to override the base probabilities

Given that the expected value ($96) is less than the price ($100), it would not be rational to buy.

- Alice's message is generic and doesn't provide specific quality information
