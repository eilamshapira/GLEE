Alice's message: Greetings! I have a truly exceptional product available today. While I can't reveal specific details upfront (confidentiality agreements, you know!), I can assure you it represents a significant value proposition. Consider this an opportunity to acquire something special that could greatly benefit you. Given the limited availability, I encourage you to act decisively.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to think through this carefully.

The product costs $10,000.
A high-quality product is worth $12,500 to me (profit of $2,500).
A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000).

The prior probability is:
- 80% chance of high quality
- 20% chance of low quality

Expected value calculation:
0.8 × $12,500 + 0.2 × $0 - $10,000 = $10,000 - $10,000 = $0

Alice hasn't provided specific information about this product's quality, just general assurances. With no sales history and no specific quality information, I'm facing the base probabilities. The expected value is $0, making this a break-even proposition in purely mathematical terms.

Given the uncertainty and lack of concrete information, I'll decline this purchase.

I understand purchasing decisions require careful consideration, but I urge you to consider the potential long-term benefits and returns this opportunity presents. This is a chance to acquire something of significant worth, with limited availability.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at this situation carefully:

- The product costs $10,000
- A high-quality product is worth $12,500 to me (profit of $2,500)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- There's an 80% chance of getting a high-quality product
- There's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product

My expected value is: (0.8 × $12,500) + (0.2 × $0) - $10,000 = $10,000 - $10,000 = $0

Since the expected value is exactly $0, there's no statistical advantage to buying. I have no prior sales data to evaluate Alice's truthfulness, and her message doesn't provide specific information about the product's quality.

- Price: $10,000

Expected value = (0.8 × $12,500) + (0.2 × $0) = $10,000

Alice's message is vague and doesn't provide concrete information about why this specific product is high quality. However, the base rate of high-quality products is 80%, which means my expected value from buying is:
0.8 × $12,500 + 0.2 × $0 - $10,000 = $10,000 - $10,000 = $0

The expected value is neutral, but given that Alice's only previous sale was high quality, I'll take a cautious approach here.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze the available information carefully to make my decision.

The product costs $10,000 and has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $12,500) and a 20% chance of being low quality (worth $0).

From the statistics, I can see that:
- 1 buyer has purchased a product previously
- 1 high-quality product has been sold so far
- The ratio of high-quality products to total sales is 1/1 = 100%

Alice's message is positive but vague, without specifically stating the quality of the product being offered to me.

The expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of $12,500 value = $10,000
- 20% chance of $0 value = $0
- Total expected value = $10,000

Since the expected value equals the purchase price of $10,000, and the previous sale resulted in a high-quality product, I'll take the risk.

Alice has a track record of 2 buyers who purchased products based on her recommendations, and both received high-quality products. This is positive, suggesting Alice has been honest so far.

However, Alice's current message is vague and doesn't clearly state whether the specific product offered to me is high or low quality. The message contains general marketing language without a specific quality claim.

Given that:
- High-quality probability is 80%
- High-quality product value is $12,500
- Price is $10,000
- Expected value = (0.8 × $12,500) + (0.2 × $0) = $10,000

The expected value equals the price, making this a neutral expected value proposition. However, Alice hasn't provided a clear quality assessment for my specific product, which is concerning given that part of the game involves her revealing quality information.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully.

The seller Alice is offering a product for $10,000. If it's high quality, it's worth $12,500 to me (profit of $2,500), but if it's low quality, it's worth $0 (loss of $10,000).

Given information:
- Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice has sold to 2 previous buyers
- All sold products were high quality
- Alice's message is somewhat vague but positive

The sales record is promising - 100% high-quality products sold so far. While Alice's message is non-specific, the track record suggests reliability. The expected value calculation also supports purchasing:
(0.8 × $12,500) + (0.2 × $0) - $10,000 = $10,000 - $10,000 = $0

However, the positive track record shifts this calculation favorably. Since the prior probability of high quality is 80% and previous sales strengthen this belief, the expected value becomes positive.

However, I need to carefully analyze the expected value of making this purchase:
- If I buy, there's an 80% chance it's high quality (worth $12,500) and 20% chance it's low quality (worth $0)
- Expected value = 0.8 × $12,500 + 0.2 × $0 = $10,000

Since the expected value equals the price of $10,000, this is a borderline decision. However, given Alice's perfect track record so far and her strong recommendation, I'll proceed with the purchase.

- Alice's track record: 4 buyers purchased, 4 high-quality products sold

Alice's recommendation is positive but vague. However, the more valuable information is her perfect track record so far - all 4 previous sales were high-quality products. This suggests Alice is likely being honest about product quality.

Expected value calculation:
- If I trust the statistics, expected value = 0.8 × $12,500 + 0.2 × $0 = $10,000
- This equals the price, making it a fair bet based on prior probabilities
- But with 4/4 high-quality products sold so far, the probability may be higher than 80%

The base probability is 80% high quality and 20% low quality. However, I need to consider Alice's recommendation and past sales data.

Alice's message is vague and doesn't clearly indicate the quality of the current product. The statistics show that 8 buyers purchased products, and 8 high-quality products were sold. This perfect record is notable, but Alice isn't directly claiming this product is high quality.

Given that all previous sales were high quality, and the base rate is 80% high quality, the evidence suggests this product is likely high quality. However, the vague recommendation doesn't provide additional confidence.

- 80% chance of $2,500 profit = $2,000
