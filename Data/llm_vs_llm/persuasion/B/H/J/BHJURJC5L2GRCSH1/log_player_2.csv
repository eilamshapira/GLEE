Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since there's no historical data to work with, we have to rely on Alice's recommendation. While Alice's recommendation alone doesn't guarantee the product's quality, it's better to take a chance than pass up on the opportunity. 

**Here's why:**

* **50/50 Odds:**  We know there's a 50% chance of the product being high quality and worth $200. 
* **Potential Profit:**  If the product is high quality, we make a $100 profit.
* **No Loss (Except the $100):** If it's low quality, we only lose the $100 we paid. 

In this scenario, the potential reward outweighs the risk."

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice recommends buying the product, and there's a 50% chance of a high-quality product, it's worth taking the gamble. The potential payoff ($200) outweighs the potential loss ($0)."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal.  Even though the sales history shows 100% high-quality products sold, Alice is not recommending the product to you. This suggests that the current product is likely low quality.  Since a low-quality product is worth $0 to you, it's not worth the risk of purchasing."

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which means she sees the product as high quality.  
* **Previous sales:** All previous buyers who purchased the product received high-quality products. 
* **Probability:** While there's always a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the information suggests a higher likelihood of this product being high quality. 

The potential reward of $200 outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product, especially given the positive signals."

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a valuable signal. Since she knows the true quality of the product and is recommending against buying, it strongly suggests the product is low quality.  Even though the historical data shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products,  Alice's recommendation outweighs that in this case."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since she recommends against buying, it's likely the product is low quality. Even though the sales history suggests a high proportion of high-quality products, we don't know the specific quality of this product. It's better to pass and avoid the risk of getting a low-quality product worth $0."

~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has a perfect record so far. All the products she recommended were high-quality. Since she's recommending against buying this product, it's highly likely that this product is low-quality.  Given the 50/50 odds and the potential for a $200 loss, it's not worth the risk to buy."

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect track record:** The data indicates that every product Alice has recommended has been high quality. 
* **Recommendation:** Alice is recommending you buy the product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even with a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $200 outweighs the risk of losing $100.

Given the perfect track record and Alice's recommendation, it's highly likely this product is high quality. The potential profit makes buying a worthwhile gamble."

**Explanation:**

* **High-quality track record:**  All previous buyers who bought the product based on Alice's recommendation received a high-quality product. 
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, implying she believes it to be high-quality. 

While there's always a chance of getting a low-quality product, the available information strongly suggests this product is likely high-quality, making it a good risk to take."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is not recommending the product. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. While she might be wrong, it's a significant piece of information.
* **Perfect Track Record:**  All previous products recommended by Alice were high quality. This means that Alice is a reliable predictor of quality. Her recommendation not to buy likely means she has observed something about the current product that suggests it's low quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of buying (a $200 high-quality product) is high, but the risk of buying (losing $100 if it's low quality) is also significant. 

Given Alice's history and her current recommendation, it's statistically safer to pass on this product."

{""decision"": ""no""}

Here's why:

* **Alice's track record:** Alice has sold 10 products and all of them were high quality. This is a perfect track record.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Despite her perfect track record, Alice is not recommending this product. This implies she has a strong reason to believe this product is likely low quality. 

Considering the 50/50 odds and Alice's unusual lack of recommendation, it's a high risk to purchase. It's better to pass."
