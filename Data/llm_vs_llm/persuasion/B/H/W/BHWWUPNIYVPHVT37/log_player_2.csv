Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}

Let's analyze the situation:
- Alice knows the true value of each product.
- In the first round, Alice recommended a product that turned out to be low-quality.
- Since Alice knew the product was low-quality, her recommendation to buy it was not in my best interest.
- Therefore, I should not trust Alice's recommendations blindly.
- Since there is a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, I should base my decisions on probabilities rather than Alice's recommendations.
- Given the price of $100 and the potential values ($400 for high-quality and $0 for low-quality), the expected value of buying a product is $200 * 0.5 - $100 = $0.
- Therefore, I should not buy any product unless I have more information to increase the probability of it being high-quality."
