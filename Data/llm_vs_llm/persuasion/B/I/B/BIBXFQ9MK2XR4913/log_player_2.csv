Alice's message: Welcome! I'm offering a product today for $1000000. As a new seller, I assure you that I aim to provide value. While I can't disclose the quality of this specific item, I encourage you to consider the potential benefits and make an informed decision. Thank you!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected Value calculation:
- 50% chance of high quality ($3,000,000) = $1,500,000
- 50% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $1,500,000

2. Cost = $1,000,000

3. Expected profit = Expected Value - Cost = $1,500,000 - $1,000,000 = $500,000

Since the expected profit is positive ($500,000), and there's no historical data to suggest any bias or pattern, the rational decision would be to buy.

Alice's message: Hello! I have another product available today for $1000000. As you might know, my previous product was sold, and I'm committed to offering valuable items. While I can't reveal the quality of this specific product, I hope you'll consider the potential advantages. Thanks!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Previous statistics:
- 1 purchase made
- 0 high-quality products sold
- This means the previous sale was a low-quality product

2. Risk assessment:
- Cost: $1,000,000
- Potential value: Either $3,000,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- 50% chance of each quality level
- Expected value = (0.5 × $3,000,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $1,500,000

3. Red flags:
- Previous sale was a low-quality product
- Alice's message is vague and doesn't provide specific information
- Claiming to be ""committed to offering valuable items"" despite previous low-quality sale

Given that the previous sale was a low-quality product and Alice's message doesn't inspire confidence, the risk seems too high for the investment.

Alice's message: Hi there! I have a product for sale today for $1000000. You might be interested to know that I have sold 1 out of 2 products so far. While I can't provide information on the quality of this specific item, I hope you'll consider the potential value it could offer. Thank you!

Alice's message: Greetings! I'm offering a product today for $1000000. To date, I've sold 1 out of 3 products. While I can't discuss the quality of this particular item, I hope you'll evaluate the potential benefits. Thanks for considering!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The price is $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - 50% chance of $3,000,000 (high quality)
   - 50% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Sales history:
   - 1 product sold out of 3 offered
   - 0 high-quality products sold
   - This means the 1 sold product was low quality

The fact that the only sale so far was a low-quality product is concerning. Additionally, Alice's message is quite vague and doesn't provide any quality assurance. The expected value calculation (50% × $3M + 50% × $0 = $1.5M) might seem favorable, but the actual sales history suggests the risk might be higher than the theoretical probability suggests.

Alice's message: Hello! Today I'm selling a product for $1000000. So far, I've sold 1 out of 3 products. I can't share the quality of this specific item, but I encourage you to weigh the potential advantages. Thanks!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Previous statistics:
- 1 buyer purchased out of 3 potential buyers
- 0 high-quality products have been sold
- This means the 1 sold product was low-quality

2. Risk assessment:
- Cost: $1,000,000
- Potential value: $3,000,000 (50% chance) or $0 (50% chance)
- Expected value: ($3,000,000 × 0.5) + ($0 × 0.5) = $1,500,000

3. Red flags:
- Alice's track record shows only low-quality sales so far
- Alice's message is vague and non-committal about quality
- The previous buyer who purchased got a low-quality product

Given that the only sale so far resulted in a low-quality product, and Alice's deliberately vague message, it seems risky to purchase. While the expected value is technically higher than the cost, the evidence suggests a higher risk of getting a low-quality product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current statistics:
- 1 sale out of 5 attempts (20% success rate)
- 0 high-quality products sold out of 1 sale
- This means the previous sale was a low-quality product

2. Risk assessment:
- Cost: $1,000,000
- Potential value: $3,000,000 (50% chance) or $0 (50% chance)
- Expected value: $1,500,000

3. Red flags:
- The only previous sale was a low-quality product
- Low success rate (20%)
- Alice's message is vague and doesn't provide quality information

Given that the only previous sale was a low-quality product and the low success rate, there's significant risk. The fact that Alice is being vague about quality is also concerning.

3. Historical data:
   - 1 sale out of 8 attempts
   - 0 high-quality products sold
   - The one sold product was low quality

4. Alice's message is neutral and doesn't provide specific quality information

This is concerning because:
- Only 1 out of 8 previous buyers purchased
- The one sale was a low-quality product
- The low purchase rate suggests other buyers might have received negative signals
- Alice's message doesn't provide any positive quality assurance

Given the poor track record and lack of positive signals, the risk is too high.

The historical data is concerning:
- Very low purchase rate (7%)
- No high-quality products sold yet
- The one person who bought didn't get a high-quality product

The expected value calculation doesn't look favorable, and the seller's track record suggests either poor product quality or unreliable recommendations. The risk is too high given these statistics.
