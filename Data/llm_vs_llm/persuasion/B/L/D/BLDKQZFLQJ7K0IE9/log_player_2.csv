Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since there's no prior data, the only information we have is Alice's recommendation.  While Alice might not know the specific quality of this product, her recommendation to buy suggests she believes it's likely to be high quality. Given the potential payoff of $4,000,000 and the 80% probability of it being high quality, the risk is worth taking."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which is a strong signal.  Even though she doesn't know the exact value to you, she likely has some internal logic for making recommendations.
* **Positive Previous Sale:**  One high-quality product was already sold, which strengthens the belief that the product being offered to you is also likely high-quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward ($4,000,000) far outweighs the potential loss ($1,000,000).  Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the expected value is still positive.

While there's always risk, the available information strongly suggests that the product is likely to be high quality."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Purchase Rate:**  2 out of 2 buyers have purchased the product, suggesting a high chance of the products being high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation is a strong signal as she likely knows the quality of the product she's offering.
* **Value Potential:** Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward of $4,000,000 outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000.

**Therefore, the decision to buy the product seems like the best option given the information available.**"

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since all the products previously sold were high quality, and Alice recommends buying this product, it's highly likely that this product is also high quality. The probability of a low-quality product being chosen is 20%, which is low enough to justify the risk, especially given the potential reward of $4,000,000."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:**  Alice has a 100% success rate in recommending high-quality products. 
* **High Expected Value:** Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($4,000,000) far outweighs the potential loss ($1,000,000). 
* **Limited Information:** While we know the overall odds of a high-quality product, Alice's recommendation provides strong evidence that this specific product is likely high-quality. 

Given these factors, it's statistically advantageous to buy the product."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation is positive:** Alice recommends buying the product.
* **The sales record is overwhelmingly positive:** 7 out of 7 products sold so far were high-quality. This suggests a very high chance of the current product being high quality as well.
* **The potential gain is significant:** A high-quality product would yield a $3,000,000 profit. 
* **The potential loss is minimal:** Even if the product is low-quality, the loss is limited to the $1,000,000 purchase price.

Given these factors, the risk-reward profile favors buying the product."

* **Historical Data:**  The historical data shows a 100% success rate (all products sold were high-quality).
* **High Expected Value:**  Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $4,000,000 outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since 9 high-quality products have been sold out of 9 purchases, this means Alice's recommendations have been 100% accurate so far.  Therefore, trusting her recommendation is the best course of action, as the potential reward ($4,000,000) heavily outweighs the potential loss ($0)."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Seller's Recommendation:**  Alice recommends buying the product. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality. 
* **Sales History:**  The sales history is perfect: 100% of the products sold have been high quality. This further reinforces the probability of the current product being high quality.
* **Value Proposition:**  A high-quality product yields a $3,000,000 profit, while a low-quality product results in a $1,000,000 loss. 

While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the overwhelming evidence from the sales history and Alice's recommendation makes buying the product the rational choice."

~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, who has access to the true quality, does not recommend buying the product. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.
* **Previous sales data:** All 14 products sold were high quality. This creates a seemingly positive bias, but it's important to remember:
    *  The sample size is small (14) and doesn't represent a statistically significant trend.
    * Alice might have a bias towards recommending high-quality products, skewing the data. 

Since the potential loss ($1,000,000) is much higher than the potential gain (which is effectively $0 if the product is low quality), it's safer to pass on the product."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's recommendation is crucial:** Alice has perfect information about the product's quality. Since she's not recommending it, it's very likely to be low quality.
* **The statistics are misleading:**  While 15 high-quality products have been sold, there's no information about how many low-quality products were also offered. The fact that the buyers decided to purchase despite Alice's lack of recommendation doesn't mean the products were good. They could have been fooled, or they might have been risk-takers.
* **The potential loss outweighs the potential gain:**  Even if the product is high quality, your profit is only $3,000,000 ($4,000,000 value - $1,000,000 cost). However, if it's low quality, you lose $1,000,000. Since the odds are against you (20% chance of low quality), the risk is too high."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** All 15 previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation received a high-quality product. This suggests Alice has a very accurate way of assessing the quality, potentially through some hidden information or expertise.
* **Zero Risk:**  While there's a theoretical 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the track record suggests this risk is practically eliminated.
* **Large Potential Gain:**  The potential reward of $4,000,000 significantly outweighs the $1,000,000 cost, even with the small risk.

**In this scenario, it's statistically and financially advantageous to buy the product.**"

{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, implying she believes it's high quality.
* **Sales History:** 16 products have been sold, all of which were high quality. This suggests a strong probability that Alice has a good understanding of the products and is likely to be accurate in her recommendation.
* **Value:** Even if the product is low quality (20% chance), the potential reward of a high-quality product ($4,000,000) outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000.
