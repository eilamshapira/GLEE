Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33%): $1,250,000 (profit of $250,000)
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0 (loss of $1,000,000)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (33.33% × $1,250,000) + (66.67% × $0) = $416,625

Since the expected value ($416,625) is less than the price ($1,000,000), and there's no previous sales history to build trust in Alice's recommendations, it would be financially unwise to make this purchase.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected value calculation:
* High quality (33.33%): $1,250,000 × 0.3333 = $416,667
* Low quality (66.67%): $0 × 0.6667 = $0
* Total expected value = $416,667

2. Cost of product: $1,000,000

3. Considerations:
* Expected value ($416,667) < Cost ($1,000,000)
* No prior sales history to verify Alice's reliability
* Even with a positive recommendation, the expected value is significantly below the cost
* The risk of loss ($1,000,000) is too high compared to potential gain ($250,000)

- Alice's recommendation alone isn't enough to overcome the negative expected value

Since the expected value is significantly lower than the cost, even with Alice's recommendation, it would not be rational to buy the product.
