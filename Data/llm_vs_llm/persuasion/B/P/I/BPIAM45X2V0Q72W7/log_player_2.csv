**Reasoning:**

While there's no historical data to base a decision on, the expected value of buying is positive:

* **Probability of high quality:** 80%
* **Value of high quality:** $125
* **Probability of low quality:** 20%
* **Value of low quality:** $0

Expected value = (0.8 * $125) + (0.2 * $0) = $100

Since the expected value ($100) is equal to the price, it's a neutral gamble.  However, Alice's recommendation adds a slight positive bias, as she has no incentive to recommend a low-quality product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, despite not knowing the value of the product to you, is not recommending it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. 
* **Limited Data:** While the previous buyer purchased a high-quality product, it's too early to draw any strong conclusions from such a small sample size. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential loss ($100) if the product is low quality outweighs the potential gain ($25) if it's high quality, especially given Alice's non-recommendation."

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice recommended buying the product, and 1 high-quality product has already been sold, it's highly likely that the current product is also high-quality. The risk of getting a low-quality product is outweighed by the potential reward of a high-quality product."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Here's why:

* **Strong Signal:**  Alice recommending the product is a significant signal. Since she has access to the true quality, her recommendation is likely based on the product being high quality.
* **Past Data:**  The past sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products. This reinforces the likelihood of the current product being high quality.

While there's still a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the positive signals outweigh the risk in this case."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has a perfect track record so far, recommending only high-quality products. While there's still a 20% chance the current product is low quality, the high probability of it being high quality and Alice's perfect track record make it a worthwhile risk."

~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who has knowledge of the product's quality, is not recommending the purchase. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.
* **Sales Record:**  The fact that all 7 previous buyers purchased high-quality products could lead to a gambler's fallacy.  We shouldn't assume that the streak of high-quality products will continue.
* **Expected Value:** Even with the 80% chance of a high-quality product, the risk of getting a low-quality product (worth $0) is too high, especially given Alice's recommendation against it. 

**Conclusion:**  The risk of buying a low-quality product outweighs the potential reward of getting a high-quality one.  It's better to pass on this opportunity."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, who has information about the product's quality, does not recommend buying it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.
* **Statistics:** While the historical data shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products, this is based on a very small sample size (11). It's entirely possible that the initial buyers were lucky. 

**Conclusion:** Given Alice's recommendation and the uncertainty surrounding the product's quality, it's safer to pass on this purchase."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, which indicates she believes it's likely high-quality. 
* **Sales Record:**  All 12 previous buyers who purchased the product received high-quality items. This strongly suggests a very high likelihood of the current product also being high-quality. 
* **Value:** Even with the risk of a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($125) outweighs the risk of losing $100. 

While there is still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the data strongly favors buying."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice has only sold high-quality products so far, and she recommends you to buy, it's highly likely that the current product is also high-quality. Given the potential profit of $125 and the low risk of getting a low-quality product, it's a good decision to buy."
