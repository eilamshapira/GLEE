"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze if buying the product is a good decision based on expected value.

The product costs $1,000,000.
- If high quality (80% chance): worth $2,000,000 → profit of $1,000,000
- If low quality (20% chance): worth $0 → loss of $1,000,000

Expected value = (0.8 × $1,000,000) + (0.2 × -$1,000,000) = $800,000 - $200,000 = $600,000

Since the expected value is positive ($600,000), it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'll analyze this decision again based on expected value.

The product costs $1,000,000.
- If high quality (80% chance): worth $2,000,000 → profit of $1,000,000
- If low quality (20% chance): worth $0 → loss of $1,000,000

Expected value = (0.8 × $1,000,000) + (0.2 × -$1,000,000) = $800,000 - $200,000 = $600,000

Since the expected value is positive ($600,000), it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to continue making decisions based on expected value. Each round is independent, and the probabilities remain the same regardless of previous outcomes.

The product costs $1,000,000.
- If high quality (80% chance): worth $2,000,000 → profit of $1,000,000
- If low quality (20% chance): worth $0 → loss of $1,000,000

Expected value = (0.8 × $1,000,000) + (0.2 × -$1,000,000) = $800,000 - $200,000 = $600,000

- If low quality (20% chance): worth $0 → loss of $1,000,000

Expected value = (0.8 × $1,000,000) + (0.2 × -$1,000,000) = $800,000 - $200,000 = $600,000
