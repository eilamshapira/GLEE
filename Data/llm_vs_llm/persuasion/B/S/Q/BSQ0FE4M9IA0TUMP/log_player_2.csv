Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50% chance): $4,000,000
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $4,000,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $2,000,000

The expected value ($2,000,000) is higher than the price ($1,000,000), and Alice is recommending the purchase. While there's no track record to base additional trust on, the pure economics of the situation suggest this is a positive expected value decision.

"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product costs $1,000,000
2. If high quality (50% chance), it's worth $4,000,000 (profit of $3,000,000)
3. If low quality (50% chance), it's worth $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
4. Alice has sold 1 product so far, and it was high quality
5. Alice is recommending this product

The fact that Alice's previous sale was high quality and she's recommending this product is positive. The expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of $3,000,000 profit = $1,500,000
- 50% chance of $1,000,000 loss = -$500,000
Net expected value = $1,000,000

Given the positive expected value and Alice's track record, I'll buy.

1. Previous statistics:
- 2 buyers purchased products
- 2 high-quality products were sold
- 100% success rate so far

2. Current situation:
- Alice is NOT recommending the product
- Alice knows the true value to me ($4M for high quality, $0 for low quality)
- Alice has been honest so far (100% high-quality sales)

3. Decision logic:
- Alice has demonstrated truthfulness in previous sales
- She is specifically advising against this purchase
- Given her track record and that she knows the true value, her negative recommendation is likely honest
- The product is probably low quality, which would be worth $0 to me

Given Alice's perfect track record and her negative recommendation, it would be risky to go against her advice.

2. Current situation:
