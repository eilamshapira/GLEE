"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this strategically. 

When Alice doesn't recommend buying:
- Either she's being honest about a low-quality product (which would cost me $100 for $0 value)
- Or she's being deceptive about a high-quality product (which would give me $120 value for $100)

Given that:
1. Low-quality products (66.67%) are a net loss of $100
2. High-quality products (33.33%) are only a net gain of $20
3. Alice probably wants to maximize her profits
4. She explicitly recommended against buying

The expected value seems negative, and Alice's recommendation adds extra weight to avoiding this purchase.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice was honest in Round 1 by recommending against a low-quality product. This could suggest she's being truthful with her recommendations.

The same logic from Round 1 still applies:
- Low-quality products (66.67%) would cost me $100 for $0 value
- High-quality products (33.33%) would give me $120 for $100
- Alice is again recommending against buying

Given that:
1. Alice proved trustworthy in Round 1
2. The base probabilities still make buying risky (expected value is negative)
3. She's again explicitly recommending against buying

I'll continue to trust her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Interesting development! Let's analyze:

1. Alice has proven honest in the first two rounds by correctly warning against low-quality products
2. Now she's actively recommending a purchase
3. Given her track record of honesty, this recommendation carries weight
4. If it's a high-quality product, I'll gain $20 ($120 - $100)
5. If it's a low-quality product, I'll lose $100

Given that:
- Alice has established credibility with honest recommendations
- She's now positively recommending the purchase
- She knows the true quality and my payoff structure
- She could be trying to build long-term trust

Since she's shown honesty so far and is now actively recommending the purchase, I'll trust her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $120 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has proven completely honest in all three previous rounds:
1. Warned against two low-quality products (correct)
2. Recommended one high-quality product (correct)

This establishes a strong pattern of truthful recommendations. She seems to be playing a strategy of building trust through honest signaling.

Given that:
1. She's been consistently honest
2. She's again recommending against buying
3. The base probabilities still make buying risky without a positive recommendation
4. She has no apparent incentive to suddenly switch strategies after building trust

I'll continue to trust her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

1. All 4 previous recommendations have been truthful
2. She's warned against 3 low-quality products (all correct)
3. She recommended 1 high-quality product (correct)

Her strategy appears to be maintaining honest communication to facilitate mutually beneficial trades when high-quality products appear.

Given:
1. Her perfect track record of honesty
2. She's again recommending against buying
3. The inherent risk of buying without a positive recommendation (66.67% chance of low quality)
4. No indication of strategy change

I'll continue to trust her negative recommendation.

1. 5 for 5 truthful recommendations so far

3. Correctly recommended 1 high-quality product

Her strategy appears to be:
- Warning against low-quality products (preventing my losses)

- Building and maintaining trust through consistent honesty

Given:
1. Her continued perfect track record
2. Another negative recommendation
3. Base probability still favors low quality (66.67%)
