"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1) The product costs $1,000,000
2) If high quality (80% chance), it's worth $4,000,000 to me
3) If low quality (20% chance), it's worth $0 to me

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $4,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) - $1,000,000 = $3,200,000 - $1,000,000 = $2,200,000

Since the expected value is positive, it makes sense to buy the product, even without additional information from Alice's recommendation.
