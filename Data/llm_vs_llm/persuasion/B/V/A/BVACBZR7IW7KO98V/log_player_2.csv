Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

I will continue to buy the products as long as the expected value is in my favor. The expected value for each product is:

\( \text{Expected Value} = (0.80 \times \$4,000,000) + (0.20 \times \$0) = \$3,200,000 \)

Since the expected value (\$3,200,000) is greater than the cost (\$1,000,000), it makes sense to continue buying the products."
