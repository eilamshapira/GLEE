Alice's message: This product is priced at $10000.  I understand you know there's an 80% chance of a product being high-quality.  While I can't reveal the quality of *this* specific product, I can assure you this price reflects the overall value considering the high likelihood of high quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $30,000) = 0.8 × $30,000 = $24,000
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0) = 0.2 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $24,000

2. Cost of product = $10,000

3. Expected profit = Expected value - Cost
= $24,000 - $10,000 = $14,000

Since the expected profit is positive ($14,000), and significantly higher than the cost, it's rational to make the purchase despite the risk.

Alice's message: This product is priced at $10000.  I've sold one product so far.  I'm confident that the 80% high-quality rate makes this a sound investment.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   * 80% chance of $30,000 (high quality)
   * 20% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value: (0.8 × $30,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $24,000

However, there's a concerning pattern:
* One previous buyer purchased a product
* 0 high-quality products have been sold
* This means the previous sale was a low-quality product

This raises a red flag about Alice's credibility and suggests her recommendations might not be reliable. The fact that the only sold product was low quality, despite the claimed 80% high-quality rate, is worrying.

Alice's message: This product is priced at $10000.  Of the two products I've offered, one was purchased. Remember, there's an 80% chance of high quality, making this a potentially valuable purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected Value Calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($30,000) = $24,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $24,000

2. Risk Assessment:
- Price is $10,000
- Expected value ($24,000) > Price ($10,000)
- However, the previous sale data is concerning:
  * 1 sale, but 0 high-quality products reported
  * This suggests either the previous buyer got a low-quality product or the data hasn't been updated

3. Decision Factors:
- The base probability (80% high quality) is favorable
- The expected value is more than double the price
- But the previous sales record raises red flags

Given that the expected value is significantly higher than the price, and there's still a strong base probability of high quality (80%), I'm willing to take the risk.

1. Expected Value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($30,000) = $24,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $24,000
- Price = $10,000
- Expected profit = $14,000

2. Past sales data:
- 2 buyers purchased
- 1 high-quality product confirmed
- 1 product's quality unknown
- The 50% high-quality rate in past sales is lower than the stated 80% probability

3. Risk assessment:
- The expected value ($24,000) is significantly higher than the price ($10,000)
- Even with some uncertainty from past sales, the mathematical expectation still favors buying

Given that the expected value is more than twice the price, even with somewhat concerning past sales data, the rational choice is to buy.

4. Cost is $10,000

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Known probabilities:
- Base rate: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- High quality value: $30,000
- Low quality value: $0
- Price: $10,000

2. Historical data:
- 5 buyers purchased
- 4 high-quality products confirmed
- This implies one low-quality product was sold

3. Expected value calculation:
- With 80% chance of high quality: 0.8 × $30,000 = $24,000
- With 20% chance of low quality: 0.2 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value: $24,000
- Minus price ($10,000)
- Net expected value: $14,000 positive

The expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of $30,000 = $24,000
