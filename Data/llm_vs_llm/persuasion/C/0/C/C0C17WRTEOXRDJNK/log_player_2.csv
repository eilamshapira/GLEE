Alice's message: Hello! I have a fantastic product for you today, priced at just $100. It's a great opportunity to get something valuable for a low price. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product costs $100
2. If high quality (50% chance): I gain $400 (net profit $300)
3. If low quality (50% chance): I gain $0 (net loss $100)
4. Expected value = (0.5 × $300) + (0.5 × -$100) = $100

Since there's no sales history yet, and Alice hasn't specifically revealed the quality of the product or provided a clear recommendation about its quality, this is purely a probability calculation.

The expected value ($100) is positive, which means mathematically it's a good bet to take.

Alice's message: Hi there! I'm offering a unique product for only $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it useful.  I've had a lot of interest in this product already, so don't miss out!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 50% chance of $400 (high quality), 50% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value: (0.5 × $400) + (0.5 × $0) = $200

Previous statistics:
- 1 purchase made
- 0 high-quality products sold
- This means the previous buyer got a low-quality product

Red flags:
- Alice's message is vague and uses pressure tactics
- Previous buyer got a low-quality product
- No specific quality information provided

Given that the previous buyer received a low-quality product and Alice's message lacks specific quality information, it would be risky to purchase.

Alice's message: Good day! I'm selling this product for a very reasonable $100. It's a great value for the price, and I believe you'll find it beneficial.  What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The seller has dealt with 1 previous buyer who purchased the product
2. Of the products sold (1), none were high quality (0)
3. This suggests the previous buyer received a low-quality product
4. The seller's vague message doesn't provide any specific quality information
5. Risk vs Reward:
   - Cost: $100
   - Potential gain: $300 (if high quality)
   - Potential loss: $100 (if low quality)
6. The previous data point suggests possible dishonesty from the seller

Given that the only data point we have shows a low-quality sale, and the seller's message is non-committal about quality, it would be risky to purchase.
