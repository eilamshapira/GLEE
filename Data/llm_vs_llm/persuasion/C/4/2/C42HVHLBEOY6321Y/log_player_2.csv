Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50% chance): $12,000
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (50% × $12,000) + (50% × $0) = $6,000

4. Considerations:
   - No sales history to evaluate Alice's credibility
   - Alice's recommendation to buy
   - Expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000)

Since the expected value ($6,000) is less than the asking price ($10,000), and there's no track record to trust Alice's recommendation, it would be financially unwise to make this purchase.

   - Alice recommends buying
   - However, Alice has incentive to sell regardless of quality

The expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000), and there's no track record to establish trust in Alice's recommendations. It would be financially unwise to buy.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The product has a base 50% chance of being high quality
2. Alice knows the true quality and has chosen NOT to recommend it
3. Alice has no sales history yet, so I can't judge her reputation
4. If it's high quality ($12,000), I gain $2,000
5. If it's low quality ($0), I lose $10,000
6. Given Alice's non-recommendation, it's more likely to be low quality

Since Alice knows the true value and is not recommending the purchase, plus the downside risk ($10,000 loss) is much greater than the upside potential ($2,000 gain), I should decline.

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50% chance): $12,000
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0

3. Expected value = (0.50 × $12,000) + (0.50 × $0) = $6,000

4. Alice recommends buying, but:
   - No sales history to verify her trustworthiness
   - She has incentive to sell regardless of quality
   - Her recommendation alone isn't reliable without track record

5. Risk analysis:
   - Potential gain: $2,000 (if high quality)
   - Potential loss: $10,000 (if low quality)
   - Expected value ($6,000) is less than price ($10,000)

Given that the expected value is less than the price, and there's no track record to trust Alice's recommendation, it would be financially unwise to buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Possible values:
   * High quality (50%): $12,000 (profit of $2,000)
   * Low quality (50%): $0 (loss of $10,000)

3. Expected value calculation:
   * (50% × $12,000) + (50% × $0) = $6,000
   * This is less than the $10,000 price

4. Additional factors:
   * No prior sales history to evaluate Alice's trustworthiness
   * Alice's recommendation could be biased as she benefits from sales
   * The potential loss ($10,000) is much larger than potential gain ($2,000)

Given that the expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000) and there's no track record to trust Alice's recommendation, it would be risky to buy.

3. Expected value = (0.5 × $12,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $6,000

Since there's no previous sales history to base my decision on, I can only consider:
1. The expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000)
2. Even with Alice's recommendation, there's no reason to trust it without any track record

The rational decision would be not to buy, as the expected value is lower than the price.
