"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this rationally:

1. The expected value of any product without additional information is:
   * 33.33% chance of $120 = $40
   * 66.67% chance of $0 = $0
   * Total expected value = $40

2. The cost is $100

3. Alice doesn't recommend buying, which likely means it's a low-quality product. This negative signal makes it even less likely to be worth $120.

4. Since the expected value ($40) is already less than the cost ($100), and Alice's recommendation makes it even less favorable, I should definitely not buy.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}

The situation is the same as the previous round:

1. Alice is not recommending the product
2. The base expected value ($40) is already below the cost ($100)
3. Alice's negative recommendation further suggests it's likely a low-quality product
4. The previous round validated that when Alice doesn't recommend a product, it was indeed low quality

It's a clear decision to not buy the product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is an interesting change. Let's analyze:

1. Unlike previous rounds, Alice is now recommending the product

2. This could be significant because:
   * Alice might be honest and indicating it's high quality
   * Or she might be trying to sell a low-quality product

3. However, even if Alice is being honest:
   * Base probability is still 33.33% for high quality
   * Even with a positive recommendation, the expected value would need to significantly increase to justify the $100 cost
   * We need the probability of high quality to be >83.33% to make the purchase worthwhile ($100/$120)

4. We don't have enough information yet about Alice's recommendation patterns to trust that her positive recommendation significantly increases the probability of high quality

5. The risk of losing $100 outweighs the potential gain, given our current information

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $120 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}

Interesting development in the last round - Alice's recommendation was actually truthful about a high-quality product. However, for this current round:

1. Alice is not recommending the product
2. In the previous two cases where Alice didn't recommend (Rounds 1 and 2), the products were indeed low quality
3. The base expected value ($40) is still well below the cost ($100)
4. Alice's negative recommendation makes it even less likely to be high quality

While we missed an opportunity in Round 3, this current situation aligns with the previous pattern where Alice's negative recommendations correctly indicated low-quality products. I'll maintain the decision not to buy when Alice doesn't recommend."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}

The pattern is becoming clearer:

1. When Alice doesn't recommend a product (Rounds 1, 2, 4), it has consistently been low quality
2. When Alice did recommend (Round 3), it was indeed high quality

Current situation:
- Alice is not recommending the product
- Based on the pattern so far, this strongly suggests it's low quality
- Base expected value ($40) is already below cost ($100)
- Alice's negative recommendation makes it even less favorable

The decision to not buy when Alice doesn't recommend continues to be the right choice based on the observed pattern."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the pattern we've seen so far:

1. Alice's recommendations have been truthful:
   * When she doesn't recommend (Rounds 1,2,4,5): all were low quality
   * When she recommended (Round 3): it was high quality

2. This suggests Alice is being honest in her recommendations

3. Current situation:
   * Alice is recommending the product
   * The only other time she recommended (Round 3), it was high quality
   * We missed out on a $20 profit in Round 3

4. If Alice is consistently honest:
   * A recommended product is likely high quality ($120 value)
   * This would make the $100 purchase price worthwhile

Given the emerging pattern of Alice's honesty and that we missed a profitable opportunity in Round 3, I'll take the risk this time.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $120 for you.

Round 7
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}

The pattern continues to be very clear and reliable:

1. Alice's recommendations have been 100% truthful:
   * When she recommends (Rounds 3, 6): both were high quality, worth $120
   * When she doesn't recommend (Rounds 1,2,4,5): all were low quality, worth $0

2. Current situation:
   * Alice is not recommending the product
   * Based on the perfect pattern so far, this strongly indicates it's low quality
   * No reason to deviate from our successful strategy

3. The last round validated our trust in Alice's positive recommendation

Since Alice is not recommending this product, and she has been completely reliable so far, I will not buy."

Round 8
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Alice continues to be 100% reliable in her recommendations:

1. Pattern remains perfect:
   * When she recommends (Rounds 3, 6): both were high quality ($120)
   * When she doesn't recommend (Rounds 1,2,4,5,7): all were low quality ($0)

2. Current situation:
   * Alice is not recommending the product
   * Following the established pattern, this means it's very likely low quality
   * A low-quality product would be worth $0, making the $100 cost a complete loss

3. There's no reason to deviate from our successful strategy of:
   * Buy when Alice recommends
   * Don't buy when Alice doesn't recommend

Since Alice is not recommending this product, I will maintain our successful strategy and not buy."

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes""}

Alice has maintained a perfect track record of honesty:

1. Previous pattern is 100% consistent:
   * When she recommends (Rounds 3, 6): both were high quality ($120) - profitable
   * When she doesn't recommend (Rounds 1,2,4,5,7,8): all were low quality ($0) - would have been losses

2. Current situation:
   * Alice is recommending the product
   * Based on her perfect track record, this strongly indicates it's high quality
   * If high quality, buying at $100 will yield $20 profit

3. The risk is justified because:
   * Alice has never given a false recommendation
   * Both previous times she recommended, we made a profit (or would have)
   * The pattern is too consistent to be random

Following our successful strategy of buying when Alice recommends, I will buy this product."

2. Current situation:
   * Alice is recommending the product
   * Given her perfect history, this very strongly indicates it's high quality
   * If high quality (which is highly likely), we'll make another $20 profit

3. Strategy validation:
