Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

While there is a 20% chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product far outweighs the risk. Here's why:

* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying is calculated as: (0.8 * $3,000,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $2,400,000. This is significantly higher than the purchase price of $1,000,000. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice knows the product's quality and is recommending you buy. This indicates that the product is likely high quality, as she wouldn't recommend a product that would result in a loss for you.

Therefore, based on the expected value and Alice's recommendation, it is a rational decision to buy the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. Since Alice knows the true value of the product, her recommendation holds significant weight.
* **Previous Sales:** One high-quality product was sold out of one purchase. This suggests a very high probability of the current product also being high-quality. 
* **Potential Upside:**  The potential gain from a high-quality product ($3,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $2,000,000) far outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0 - $1,000,000 = -$1,000,000).

While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the information available strongly suggests a high-quality product. The potential reward justifies the risk."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product.  Since she knows the product's true quality and wants to maximize her sales, this is a strong indicator that the product is likely high quality.
* **Previous Sales:**  Two high-quality products have been sold out of two total sales. This suggests a much higher than 80% chance of the product being high quality.
* **Potential Gain:**  A high-quality product would provide a significant gain of $3,000,000. The potential loss is only $1,000,000 if the product is low quality. 

Given the high likelihood of a high-quality product and the significant potential gain, it's a worthwhile risk to take."

* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying the product is: 
    * (0.8 probability of high quality * $3,000,000 value) + (0.2 probability of low quality * $0 value) = $2,400,000.
    * This is significantly higher than the $1,000,000 purchase price.

Given the strong recommendation, the positive sales record, and the high expected value, it's a rational decision to buy the product."
