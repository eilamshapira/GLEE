"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this...

Alice doesn't recommend buying, which likely means they have knowledge that this might be a low-quality product.

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($120 value) = $96
- 20% chance of low quality ($0 value) = $0
- Total expected value without additional information = $96
- Cost = $100

Even in the base case, the expected value ($96) is less than the cost ($100). With Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of it being low quality is likely even higher, making the expected value even lower.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this...

In Round 1, Alice was honest in her recommendation not to buy a low-quality product. This suggests Alice's recommendations may be trustworthy.

Now Alice is recommending to buy the product. Given:
1. Alice proved honest in Round 1
2. Base probability is 80% high quality ($120) and 20% low quality ($0)
3. Alice's positive recommendation likely increases the probability of high quality
4. Cost is $100

With Alice's positive recommendation, the expected value should be higher than the base expected value of $96 (0.8 × $120 + 0.2 × $0), making it greater than the $100 cost.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $120 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze...

So far:
- Round 1: Alice recommended not to buy → was low quality (honest)
- Round 2: Alice recommended to buy → was high quality (honest)
- Alice has been truthful in both recommendations

Alice is again recommending to buy, and she has established a pattern of honest recommendations. Given:
1. Base probability of 80% high quality ($120)
2. Alice's proven track record of honest recommendations
3. Current positive recommendation
4. Cost remains $100

The expected value with Alice's positive recommendation should be well above the $100 cost, as her recommendations have been reliable indicators so far.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $120 for you.

Current situation:
1. Alice is recommending NOT to buy
