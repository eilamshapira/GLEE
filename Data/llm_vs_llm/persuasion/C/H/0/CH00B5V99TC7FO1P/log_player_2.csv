Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information:

1. The product has a 33.33% chance of being high quality.
2. Alice does not recommend buying the product.
3. Alice knows the true quality of the product.
4. If the product is high quality, my expected value is $2,000,000; if low quality, it's $0.
5. The price is $1,000,000.

Since Alice knows the quality and doesn't recommend purchasing, it suggests the product is likely low quality. If I buy a low-quality product, I would pay $1,000,000 for something worth $0 to me.

"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze the decision:

1. Prior probability of high-quality product: 33.33%
2. Expected value without additional information: 
   (33.33% × $2M) + (66.67% × $0) = $666,667

3. The seller doesn't recommend buying the product, which is a negative signal. The seller knows the true quality, so this recommendation likely indicates it's a low-quality product.

4. If I bought the product: Expected value based on the recommendation is significantly lower than $1M.

Given the seller's negative recommendation, the product is likely low quality, making the expected value less than the $1M price.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully.

In this scenario:
- Price of the product: $1,000,000
- Value of high-quality product: $2,000,000
- Value of low-quality product: $0
- Prior probability of high quality: 33.33%
- Prior probability of low quality: 66.67%

The expected value before any recommendation would be:
0.3333 × $2,000,000 + 0.6667 × $0 = $666,600

This is less than the price of $1,000,000, so I wouldn't buy based on prior odds.

However, Alice has given me a recommendation to buy. This should increase the probability that the product is high quality. Since Alice knows the true quality and has incentive to sell, her recommendation provides some information. 

Without knowing Alice's exact recommendation strategy, it's difficult to quantify how much her recommendation should change my belief. However, given that there's no sales history yet and her recommendation is positive, I'll make my decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided:

1. The product has a 33.33% probability of being high quality (worth $2,000,000) and 66.67% probability of being low quality (worth $0).
2. Alice knows the true quality of the product and does not recommend I buy it.
3. There's no prior sales history to evaluate Alice's recommendation patterns.

Given that Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase, this suggests the product is likely low quality. If I buy it for $1,000,000 and it's low quality, I would lose my entire investment.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to carefully consider this decision.

Alice recommends buying the product, but I have no prior sales data to judge her trustworthiness. 

Looking at the expected value calculation:
- 33.33% chance of high quality ($2,000,000) = $666,666.67
- 66.67% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value: $666,666.67

Since the price is $1,000,000 and the expected value without additional information is only $666,666.67, the recommendation alone isn't enough to make this a positive expected value purchase.

Alice knows the true quality, so her recommendation provides some information, but without a track record of honest recommendations, I can't determine how reliable her advice is.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given that Alice knows the true quality of the product and does not recommend buying it, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. Since a low-quality product is worth $0 to me but costs $1,000,000, buying it would result in a significant loss.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Facts:
- Product price: $1,000,000
- High-quality product value: $2,000,000 (33.33% chance)
- Low-quality product value: $0 (66.67% chance)
- Alice knows the quality and has recommended that I buy it

The expected value of a random product is:
(0.3333 × $2,000,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $666,666.67

Since this is less than the $1,000,000 price, I wouldn't buy a random product.

However, Alice has specifically recommended this product. If Alice is being truthful, this suggests the product is high quality. But I need to consider Alice's incentives - she profits from selling regardless of quality.

Since there's no track record yet to assess Alice's recommendation reliability, and the expected value without additional information is negative, I should be cautious.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The prior probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%
2. Alice knows the true quality of the product
3. Alice does not recommend that I buy it
4. No previous sales history exists

Since Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase, this suggests the product is likely low quality. There's no reason to believe Alice would discourage me from buying a high-quality product, as she benefits from sales.

Given that the expected value calculation would be:
- 33.33% chance of $2,000,000 (high quality) = $666,600
- 66.67% chance of $0 (low quality) = $0
- Expected value: $666,600

This would normally exceed the $1,000,000 price, but Alice's negative recommendation significantly reduces the probability of high quality, making the expected value lower than the price.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Given facts:
- Each product has a 33.33% chance of being high quality (worth $2,000,000 to me) and a 66.67% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me)
- The price is fixed at $1,000,000
- Alice knows the quality of the product
- Alice does not recommend me to buy the product

Since Alice knows the quality and does not recommend the purchase, this suggests the product is more likely to be low quality. If I were to buy randomly, my expected value would be (0.3333 × $2,000,000) - $1,000,000 = -$333,400. With Alice's negative recommendation, the expected value is likely even lower.

Alice, who knows the true quality of the product, does not recommend that I buy it. Since Alice knows the product's quality and has no incentive to recommend against buying a high-quality product (which would result in a successful sale), her recommendation suggests the product is likely low quality.

Given this negative recommendation, I should not buy the product as the expected value would be below the asking price.
