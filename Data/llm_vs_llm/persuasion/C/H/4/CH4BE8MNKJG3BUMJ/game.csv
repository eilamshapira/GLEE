low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'd like to offer you this product for $1000000. We've reached a point where you've seen a significant number of products, and I'm starting to wonder if you're adopting a strategy of waiting for a specific signal or pattern.

I'm not changing my approach, and I'm continuing to offer products at the same price, leaving the decision entirely up to you.",

With 8 previous products declined, I believe it's essential to consider the potential value of this product, given the 50% probability of it being high-quality.

,,Alice,14,"This product is available for $1000000. We're now 14 rounds in, and you've declined every single product. I'm starting to think that you might have a very high threshold for purchasing, or perhaps you're not interested in acquiring products at this price point. I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, and it's possible that a future product could bring significant value to you.

However, if you're not willing to take on any risk or consider the potential benefits of purchasing a product, then I'm not sure how we can move forward. I'm continuing to offer products out of obligation, but I'm not optimistic about the likelihood of a sale.

I'm not going to sugarcoat it - if you don't purchase this product or one of the remaining two, I'll be left wondering what could have been. I've been consistent and transparent throughout our interaction, and I believe I've given you every opportunity to make an informed decision. If you're going to take a chance, now is the time.
