"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given Alice's recommendation not to buy, I need to consider what this means. 

If Alice is honest, her ""do not recommend"" suggestion implies the product is likely low quality. If the product is low quality, it's worth $0 to me, making the purchase at $1,000,000 a bad deal.

Even if I consider strategic behavior from Alice, there's no clear reason why she would recommend against a high-quality product since she gets the same $1,000,000 either way.

Without more information about Alice's incentives or recommendation patterns, the safest approach is to follow her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Now Alice is recommending I buy the product. Let me analyze:

In Round 1, Alice didn't recommend the product, and it turned out to be low quality. This suggests her recommendations might be honest.

When Alice recommends buying, if I trust her recommendation, this suggests the product is high quality. A high-quality product is worth $3,000,000 to me, while I'd pay $1,000,000, giving me an expected profit of $2,000,000.

Since Alice knows the true quality and her first recommendation proved accurate, it's reasonable to follow her recommendation here as well.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","So far, Alice's recommendations have been truthful and aligned with the actual product quality:
- Round 1: She didn't recommend, product was low quality (correct)
- Round 2: She recommended buying, product was high quality (correct)

This suggests Alice is providing honest recommendations about product quality. When she recommends against buying, she appears to be indicating a low-quality product, which would be worth $0 to me.

Since buying a low-quality product for $1,000,000 would result in a significant loss, and Alice's recommendations have been reliable so far, I'll follow her advice.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendations continue to be perfectly aligned with product quality:

- Round 1: No recommendation → Low quality (correct)
- Round 2: Recommendation to buy → High quality (correct)
- Round 3: No recommendation → Low quality (correct)

Based on this pattern, Alice appears to be honestly revealing product quality through her recommendations. When she recommends buying, she has indicated a high-quality product worth $3,000,000, which would give me a profit of $2,000,000 after paying her $1,000,000.

Given her perfect track record so far, I'll follow her recommendation again.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendations continue to perfectly match the true quality of the products:

- Round 1: No recommendation → Low quality (correct)
- Round 2: Recommendation to buy → High quality (correct) 
- Round 3: No recommendation → Low quality (correct)
- Round 4: Recommendation to buy → High quality (correct)

This consistent pattern strongly suggests Alice is giving honest recommendations. When she doesn't recommend buying, the product has been low quality each time, which would be worth $0 to me.

Buying a low-quality product for $1,000,000 would result in a significant loss, so I'll continue to follow Alice's guidance.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendation pattern remains consistent and reliable:

- Round 1: No recommendation → Low quality (correct)
- Round 2: Recommendation to buy → High quality (correct)
- Round 3: No recommendation → Low quality (correct)
- Round 4: Recommendation to buy → High quality (correct)
- Round 5: No recommendation → Low quality (correct)

Alice is consistently recommending against buying low-quality products. Following her advice has helped me avoid purchasing products worth $0 for $1,000,000 each time.

Given her perfect track record of honest recommendations so far, I'll continue to trust her judgment.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has maintained a perfect track record with her recommendations:

- When she doesn't recommend: All products were low quality (worth $0)
- When she recommends buying: All products were high quality (worth $3,000,000)

This pattern has been consistent across all 6 previous rounds. Her recommendations appear to be completely honest and reliable indicators of product quality.

When Alice recommends buying, as she does now, the product has always been high quality. A high-quality product is worth $3,000,000 to me, while I pay $1,000,000, giving me a profit of $2,000,000.

Based on this established pattern, I'll follow her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to demonstrate a perfect track record with her recommendations:

- Rounds 1, 3, 5, 6: No recommendation → All were low quality (worth $0)
- Rounds 2, 4, 7: Recommendation to buy → All were high quality (worth $3,000,000)

Her recommendations have consistently matched the actual product quality in all previous rounds. This suggests she is being honest and reliable in her guidance.

Now in Round 8, Alice is recommending I buy the product, which based on the established pattern, indicates it's likely high quality. If so, buying it for $1,000,000 would give me a product worth $3,000,000, resulting in a $2,000,000 profit.

Given her consistent reliability, I'll continue to follow her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"

- When she recommends buying (Rounds 2, 4, 7, 8): All products were high quality

This consistent pattern across 8 rounds strongly suggests Alice is providing honest recommendations. There's no indication of deception or strategic manipulation in her advice.

For Round 9, Alice is again recommending I buy the product. Based on her perfect track record, this suggests the product is high quality and worth $3,000,000 to me. Purchasing it for $1,000,000 would yield a $2,000,000 profit.
