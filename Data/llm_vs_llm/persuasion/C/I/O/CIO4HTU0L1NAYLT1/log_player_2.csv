"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $100
2. If high quality (80% chance): Worth $200 (profit of $100)
3. If low quality (20% chance): Worth $0 (loss of $100)

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of $100 profit = $80
- 20% chance of $100 loss = -$20
- Net expected value = $60

Since Alice has recommended the product and the expected value is positive ($60), it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given that:
1. Alice was honest in Round 1 (recommended a high-quality product)
2. The base probability remains 80% high quality / 20% low quality
3. Alice's recommendation appears consistent with Round 1
4. Expected value calculation remains the same:
   - 80% chance of $100 profit = $80
   - 20% chance of $100 loss = -$20
   - Net expected value = $60

Since Alice has maintained trustworthy behavior and the expected value is positive, it's rational to continue buying.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze:
1. Alice has been truthful in both previous rounds (2/2 honest recommendations)
2. Base probabilities still hold at 80% high quality / 20% low quality
3. Alice's continued recommendation pattern suggests consistency
4. Expected value remains positive at $60:
   - 80% chance of $100 profit = $80
   - 20% chance of $100 loss = -$20

With Alice's perfect track record so far and the positive expected value, there's no reason to change strategy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Analyzing the situation:
1. Alice has been truthful in all previous rounds (3/3 honest recommendations)
2. Her recommendations have consistently led to profitable outcomes
3. Base probabilities remain at 80% high quality / 20% low quality
4. Expected value calculation is still positive at $60:
   - 80% chance of $100 profit = $80
   - 20% chance of $100 loss = -$20

Given Alice's perfect track record and the unchanged positive expected value, continuing to trust her recommendation is rational.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is an interesting change:
1. Alice has been completely honest in previous rounds (4/4)
2. For the first time, she is NOT recommending the purchase
3. Given her proven trustworthiness, this is likely a warning
4. While base probability is still 80% high/20% low, Alice has inside information about this specific product's quality

The key insight here is that Alice has proven reliable and has no reason to discourage a purchase unless she knows something negative. Given that she's been honest so far and is now specifically warning against purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality.

Therefore, despite the general 80/20 odds, in this specific case with Alice's warning, it's best to trust her judgment.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze:
1. Alice has proven completely honest in all 5 previous rounds:
   - Recommended 4 products that were all high quality
   - Warned against 1 product that was indeed low quality
2. She's back to recommending this product
3. Base probabilities remain 80% high / 20% low
4. Expected value is still $60 with typical probabilities, but Alice's perfect track record suggests even higher confidence

Alice has demonstrated she's willing to warn us about bad products, and her recommendations have been 100% accurate. When she recommends buying, it's been consistently profitable.

Given her proven reliability and return to a positive recommendation, we should trust her judgment.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 7

   - 1 negative recommendation that was indeed low quality
2. She is again warning against purchase
3. Her previous warning in Round 5 proved accurate (was low quality)
4. She has consistently demonstrated she will warn us about bad products

Given that:
- Alice has perfect credibility
- Her previous warning was accurate
- She has no incentive to lie (she makes money on sales)
- When she warns against buying, it's likely because she knows it's low quality

The rational choice is to trust her warning and not buy.
