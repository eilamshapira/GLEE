Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50% chance): $4,000,000
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(50% × $4,000,000) + (50% × $0) = $2,000,000

Since the expected value ($2,000,000) is greater than the price ($1,000,000), and Alice is recommending the purchase, it's rational to buy.

1. Product price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality: $4,000,000 (50% chance)
   - Low quality: $0 (50% chance)
3. Alice's track record:
   - 1 previous buyer
   - 1 high-quality product sold
   - 100% success rate so far
4. Alice recommends buying

This looks promising because:
1. Alice's recommendation has been reliable (100% accuracy for the previous sale)
2. The expected value calculation is favorable:
   - 50% chance of $4M = $2M expected value
   - This is greater than the $1M price

Given Alice's perfect track record so far and her positive recommendation, combined with the favorable expected value, I'll buy.

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality: $4,000,000 (50% chance)
   - Low quality: $0 (50% chance)
3. Previous statistics:
   - 2 buyers purchased
   - 1 high-quality product sold
   - This means 1 low-quality product was sold
4. Alice is recommending to buy

Expected value calculation:
- If quality distribution is truly random (50/50), and considering past sales history (1 high, 1 low), this pattern aligns with the expected probability.
- Expected value = (0.5 × $4,000,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $2,000,000
- Cost = $1,000,000

Since the expected value ($2,000,000) is greater than the cost ($1,000,000), and Alice's past recommendations show a balanced mix of outcomes, it's rational to buy.

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value: $4,000,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
3. Statistics so far:
   - 3 buyers purchased
   - Only 1 high-quality product sold
   - This means 2 buyers got low-quality products
4. Alice is recommending to buy

This is concerning because:
- Out of 3 sold products, only 1 was high quality (33.3%)
- Even with Alice's recommendations, 2 buyers got low-quality products
- This suggests Alice's recommendations aren't reliable
- The expected value would be lower than the price given this track record

Given these statistics, purchasing would be too risky. The historical data shows poor outcomes for previous buyers, even with Alice's recommendations.

3. Current statistics:
   * 3 buyers purchased
   * Only 1 high-quality product (33.33% success rate)
   * This is below the expected 50% rate
   * Alice's recommendations haven't proven very reliable

Even though Alice recommends buying, her track record shows that 2 out of 3 previous buyers got low-quality products despite her recommendations. This suggests her recommendations might not be trustworthy, and the actual success rate (33.33%) is worse than random chance (50%).

2. Historical data analysis:
- 3 buyers so far
- Only 1 high-quality product sold
- This seems concerning as it's below the expected 50% rate

3. Alice's recommendation:
- Alice is recommending to buy
- However, given the track record (1/3 high quality), her recommendations might not be reliable

4. Decision logic:
- The expected value ($2M) is higher than the price ($1M)
- But the historical data suggests worse odds than the base 50/50
- This increases the risk significantly

Given the poor track record of high-quality products (only 1 out of 3), I don't think the risk is worth taking.

3. Risk assessment:
- Past performance shows Alice's recommendations led to more losses than gains
- The track record suggests Alice might be giving misleading recommendations
- With 2 out of 3 previous sales being low quality, there's a concerning pattern

Given that Alice's previous recommendations resulted in mostly low-quality products and the poor track record of sales, I don't trust the recommendation enough to risk $1,000,000.

- The track record shows she's willing to recommend low-quality products

Even though the expected value ($2,000,000) is higher than the cost ($1,000,000), Alice's poor track record makes this a risky investment. Given that 2/3 of previous sales were low-quality products, despite her recommendations, I should decline.

Given that only 1 out of 3 sold products (33.3%) were high quality, and Alice's previous recommendations led to buyers purchasing low-quality products, her recommendation doesn't seem reliable. The track record suggests she might be trying to sell regardless of quality.

Since the historical data shows more low-quality sales than would be expected from random chance (33.3% vs expected 50%), and the price ($1,000,000) is higher than the statistical expected value considering past performance (33.3% × $4,000,000 = $1,333,333), it would be risky to buy.
