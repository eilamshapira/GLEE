Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is against buying the product, and there is no prior sales data to suggest a higher probability of high quality. Since the product has a 50/50 chance of being high quality or low quality, and a low-quality product is worth $0, it's not a good risk to take."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since there is no prior information on product quality, and Alice recommends against buying, the odds are heavily in favor of the product being low quality.  It's not worth the risk of losing $10,000."

Here's why:

* **Limited Information:** You have very little information to go on.  The only data point is that one buyer purchased a high-quality product. This could mean Alice is a good judge of quality, or it could be pure luck.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the product adds some weight to the decision. While she doesn't know the specific value to you, her recommendation suggests she believes it's likely to be high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward ($40,000) is significantly higher than the potential loss ($10,000). 

Given the limited information and the potential for a large payoff, it makes sense to take a chance and buy the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice recommends buying, suggesting she believes the product is high-quality.
* **Previous sales:**  Two previous buyers purchased and received high-quality products. This is a strong signal that Alice's recommendations are reliable.
* **Potential payoff:**  The potential reward of a $40,000 high-quality product significantly outweighs the risk of a $0 low-quality product, especially with the positive information available.

**While there's still a 50% chance of the product being low-quality, the available data strongly suggests it's a good bet to take.**"

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since all three previous buyers purchased the product and received high-quality items, it's highly likely the current product is also high-quality. Even though there's a 50% chance of it being low-quality, the evidence strongly suggests otherwise. The potential reward of $40,000 significantly outweighs the risk of $0."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Sales Rate:**  All 4 buyers who purchased products from Alice received high-quality items. This suggests a very strong likelihood that the current product is also high-quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, which further reinforces the possibility of it being high-quality. 

Given the overwhelming evidence suggesting the product's high quality, the risk-reward ratio heavily favors buying. The potential gain of $30,000 ($40,000 value - $10,000 cost) outweighs the potential loss of $10,000."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which is valuable information since she has seen the product's quality.
* **Perfect Track Record:**  All previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation ended up with high-quality products. 
* **50/50 Odds:**  Even without Alice's recommendation, the odds of the product being high-quality are still 50%.

The combination of Alice's recommendation and the perfect track record strongly suggests this product is likely high-quality. The potential gain ($40,000) far outweighs the risk of losing the $10,000 investment."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect track record:** Alice has a perfect record of recommending only high-quality products so far.
* **High potential reward:**  A high-quality product offers a $30,000 profit ($40,000 value - $10,000 cost).
* **No downside risk:** Even if the product is low quality, you only lose the $10,000 purchase price.

Given the information available, it's statistically more likely that the product is high quality. The potential reward outweighs the potential risk."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, despite having a perfect track record of selling high-quality products, is recommending against buying this product. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low-quality.
* **50/50 odds:** Even though Alice has a perfect record, the inherent 50/50 chance of getting a low-quality product still exists. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of $40,000 is high, but the risk of losing $10,000 is also significant. Given the uncertainty and Alice's recommendation, it's better to pass on this opportunity."

**Explanation:**

Given the information, we know that 9 of the 9 buyers who purchased the products received a high-quality product. This suggests a strong probability that the current product is also high-quality. While we don't know for certain, the statistics heavily favor the product being high-quality, making it a good risk to take."
