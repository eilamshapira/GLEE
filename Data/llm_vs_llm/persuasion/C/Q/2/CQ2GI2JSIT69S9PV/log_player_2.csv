"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'll analyze this situation:

- If the product is high quality (50% chance), it's worth $40,000 to me
- If the product is low quality (50% chance), it's worth $0 to me
- The price is $10,000 regardless of quality

The expected value of buying is:
(0.5 × $40,000) + (0.5 × $0) - $10,000 = $20,000 - $10,000 = $10,000

Since the expected value is positive ($10,000), buying is rational. Alice's recommendation might be biased since she wants to sell, but in this case, the math supports buying even with the uncertainty.
