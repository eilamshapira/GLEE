Alice's message: Hello! I'm offering a unique product today. While I can't disclose specifics, I can share that I believe in the value of what I offer. I've sold many items, and the quality has always been a priority for me. Are you interested?

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this carefully. 

Alice has not revealed the quality of the randomly selected product to me, despite the game rules stating she should do so. She's only provided a vague message about believing in the value of what she offers. Additionally, the statistics show that no products have been sold yet, so I have no track record to evaluate.

Without knowing the true quality of the specific product being offered to me, I can't make an informed decision. The expected value calculation would be: 
- 50% chance of high quality ($3,000,000) = $1,500,000
- 50% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Expected value = $1,500,000

However, since Alice hasn't followed the game rules by revealing the product quality, I should not proceed with the purchase.

Alice's message: Good day! I have a product for you today. Considering my past sales record, and my commitment to delivering value, I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment. Shall we proceed?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the provided information, I need to make a decision about whether to purchase a product for $1,000,000 that has a 50% chance of being worth $3,000,000 (high quality) and a 50% chance of being worth $0 (low quality).

Alice hasn't sold any products yet, so there's no track record to evaluate. Her message doesn't reveal any specific information about the quality of the product she's offering me. Without any additional information about the product quality, the expected value calculation is:
(0.5 × $3,000,000) + (0.5 × $0) - $1,000,000 = $1,500,000 - $1,000,000 = $500,000

Since the expected value is positive, it's statistically favorable to purchase the product.

Alice's message: Greetings! I'm offering a product today. I pride myself on transparency and building trust with my customers. While I can't provide exact details, I believe this product represents a solid investment, especially given my track record. What are your thoughts?

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to carefully consider this offer.

Given the information:
- The product costs $1,000,000
- If high quality: worth $3,000,000 to me (gain of $2,000,000)
- If low quality: worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000)
- 1 previous buyer purchased a product
- 0 high-quality products have been sold so far

The fact that one product was purchased but zero high-quality products were sold suggests the previous buyer received a low-quality product. Alice's message is vague and doesn't provide specific information about the current product's quality.

Without clear evidence that this product is high quality, and with concerning statistics from previous sales, the expected value of this purchase is negative.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to assess this offer carefully.

The seller has made vague statements about quality but hasn't specifically said whether this product is high or low quality. This is concerning.

The statistics show that 1 previous buyer purchased a product, but 0 high-quality products have been sold. This suggests the previous sale was a low-quality product, which would be worth $0 to me.

Given:
- The price is $1,000,000
- The expected value calculation: (0.5 × $3,000,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $1,500,000
- The previous sale history suggests Alice might be selling low-quality products

Without a clear indication about this specific product's quality, and with unfavorable past sales data, I should decline.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to carefully evaluate this decision based on the expected value.

Looking at the statistics:
- Only 1 buyer has purchased so far
- 0 high-quality products have been sold
- This suggests the previous buyer may have received a low-quality product

The expected value calculation:
- If high quality (50% chance): $3,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $2,000,000 profit
- If low quality (50% chance): $0 - $1,000,000 = -$1,000,000 loss
- Expected value: 0.5 × $2,000,000 + 0.5 × (-$1,000,000) = $500,000

While Alice's message is positive, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet is concerning. However, with only one previous buyer, this could easily be due to chance rather than indicating a pattern.

Since the expected value remains positive, the rational decision is to purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to calculate the expected value of this purchase decision.

Looking at the statistics:
- 2 buyers purchased products
- Only 1 high-quality product has been sold
- This means only 50% of sold products were high quality (same as the base probability)

If I buy:
- 50% chance of high quality: 0.5 × $3,000,000 = $1,500,000
- 50% chance of low quality: 0.5 × $0 = $0
- Expected value: $1,500,000
- Cost: $1,000,000
- Net expected value: $1,500,000 - $1,000,000 = $500,000

Since the expected value ($1,500,000) exceeds the cost ($1,000,000), it's rational to buy.

Alice's message doesn't provide any information about the quality of my specific product. I notice that:
- 3 buyers have purchased products so far
- 2 high-quality products have been sold
- The expected value calculation: (50% × $3,000,000) - $1,000,000 = $500,000

However, there's a critical issue: Alice hasn't revealed the true quality of my product as described in the game rules. The rules state ""Alice randomly selects a product and reveals its true quality"" before making a recommendation. Since Alice hasn't disclosed whether my product is high or low quality, I don't have sufficient information to make an informed decision.

From the statistics, I see that:
- 3 buyers have purchased products
- 2 high-quality products have been sold
- This means 1 low-quality product was also sold
- The success rate is 2/3 (66.67%)

Let me calculate the expected value:
- If I buy: 0.6667 × $3,000,000 + 0.3333 × $0 = $2,000,100
- Cost: $1,000,000

- Alice's sales record: 4 buyers purchased, 3 high-quality products sold (75% high quality)
- Alice didn't clearly state the quality of my specific product

The expected value calculation:
- If I assume the 75% rate applies: 0.75 × $3,000,000 + 0.25 × $0 = $2,250,000
- This exceeds the $1,000,000 price

However, Alice didn't explicitly tell me whether my specific product is high quality. Her message is vague and doesn't contain the direct product quality information that the game rules suggest she should provide.
