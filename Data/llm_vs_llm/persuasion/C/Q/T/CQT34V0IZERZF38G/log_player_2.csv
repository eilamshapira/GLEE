Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33%): $20,000 (profit of $10,000)
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0 (loss of $10,000)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (33.33% × $20,000) + (66.67% × $0) = $6,666

4. Since there's no sales history, I can only rely on:
   - The base probabilities
   - Alice's recommendation
   - Alice knows the true value

However, even with Alice's recommendation, the expected value ($6,666) is less than the price ($10,000), making this a risky purchase.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Prior probability of high quality is 33.33% (worth $20,000)
2. Prior probability of low quality is 66.67% (worth $0)
3. Price is $10,000
4. Alice knows the true quality and does not recommend buying
5. Alice has no established track record yet

Given that Alice knows the true value and is not recommending the purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If it were high quality (worth $20,000), Alice would likely recommend it since a sale would be mutually beneficial.

The seller's negative recommendation, combined with the already higher prior probability of low quality (66.67%), makes it very likely this is a low-quality product worth $0.

Expected value would be negative, so I should not buy.

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33%): $20,000
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0

3. Expected value without any additional information:
   (0.3333 × $20,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $6,666

4. Alice's recommendation:
   - She knows the true quality
   - She doesn't recommend buying
   - As a rational seller, she would want to sell if it's high quality
   - Not recommending suggests it's likely low quality

Given Alice's negative recommendation and the fact that the expected value ($6,666) is already below the asking price ($10,000), it's most rational to decline.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. The base probability is 33.33% for high quality ($20,000 value) and 66.67% for low quality ($0 value)
2. Price is fixed at $10,000
3. Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying
4. No prior sales history to reference

Given that Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. While Alice's incentives aren't explicitly stated, there's no clear reason why she would discourage a sale of a high-quality item.

Expected value if randomly buying:
(0.3333 × $20,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $6,666

This is already below the $10,000 price, and with Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of high quality is likely even lower.
