Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($2,000,000) significantly outweighs the risk.  Since there's no information about previous sales, we have to rely on the 80% probability of the product being high quality. In this scenario, the potential gain outweighs the potential loss."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Value:** A high-quality product is worth $2,000,000 to you, while a low-quality product is worth $0. This creates a significant potential upside.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which suggests she believes the product is high-quality. While her knowledge is limited, it adds a bit of information.
* **Previous Sales:** Only one product has been sold, and it was high quality. This is a small sample size, but it's a positive signal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential loss is $1,000,000, but the potential gain is $1,000,000. Considering the possible upside and Alice's recommendation, the risk seems manageable.

While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward outweighs the risk in this case."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Sales Success Rate:**  All previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation purchased high-quality products. This suggests a very strong correlation between Alice's recommendation and product quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the product is low quality (20% chance), you lose $1,000,000. However, if it's high quality (80% chance), you gain $1,000,000. The potential reward significantly outweighs the potential loss.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Since Alice is a seller, she has an incentive to sell products. Therefore, recommending a high-quality product increases her chances of a successful sale.  

It's important to note that this decision is based on the information provided. There's always a risk involved, but the available data strongly suggests a favorable outcome."

* **High Probability:** The product has an 80% chance of being high quality, making it a very favorable risk.
* **Potential Profit:**  Even if the product is low-quality (20% chance), you lose only $1,000,000. If it's high-quality (80% chance), you gain $1,000,000.
