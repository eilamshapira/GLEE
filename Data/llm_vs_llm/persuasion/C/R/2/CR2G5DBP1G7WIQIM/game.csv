I'm starting to think that you might be waiting for a signal or a pattern to emerge. I'll give you a subtle hint: the current product is similar in quality to the previous one. If you're looking for a high-quality product, this might be an opportunity you won't want to miss. The price remains $1000000.",

Now, I'd like to offer you another product, and I'm confident that it's just as valuable as the last one.

If you're looking to continue your streak, I believe this product is a great opportunity. The price remains $1000000. Will you go for three in a row?",

However, I want to be upfront with you - the current product is not of the same caliber as the previous three. I'm not going to try to convince you that it's something it's not. If you're looking to continue buying products, I want to assure you that I'll be transparent about the quality going forward. That being said, the price of $1000000 is still the same, and it's up to you to decide whether you want to take on the risk.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You've been on an impressive streak, purchasing five high-quality products in a row. However, I want to be upfront with you - the current product is not one of them. As you know, the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and sometimes that means we get a low-quality product. I'm not going to try to convince you that this product is something it's not. If you're looking to maintain your perfect record of only buying high-quality products, I would advise you to pass on this one.
