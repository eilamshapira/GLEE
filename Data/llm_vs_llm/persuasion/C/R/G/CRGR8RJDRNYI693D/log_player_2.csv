"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this decision:

The expected value calculation if I buy randomly:
- 33.33% chance of high quality: $3,000,000 * 0.3333 = $999,990
- 66.67% chance of low quality: $0 * 0.6667 = $0
Total expected value: $999,990, which is slightly less than the price of $1,000,000

However, Alice is giving me a recommendation not to buy. This is additional information that should influence my decision. If Alice is being truthful and knows the product quality, then her recommendation suggests this is a low-quality product worth $0 to me.

Given this recommendation against purchase, I should not buy this product.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this decision:

The base expected value calculation remains:
- 33.33% chance of high quality: $3,000,000 * 0.3333 = $999,990
- 66.67% chance of low quality: $0 * 0.6667 = $0
Total expected value: $999,990, which is slightly less than the price of $1,000,000

However, Alice is now recommending that I buy the product. This suggests the product might be high quality worth $3,000,000 to me. In the previous round, Alice's recommendation not to buy aligned with the product being low quality, suggesting her recommendations may be truthful.

If I trust Alice's recommendation, the expected value would be higher than the price, making it a good purchase.

Given this recommendation to buy and the previous evidence of her recommendation being accurate, I should buy this product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this decision:

So far, Alice's recommendations have been accurate:

- Round 2: Alice recommended to buy → The product was indeed high quality

Given that Alice's recommendations have aligned with the true quality in both previous rounds, I have reason to trust her judgment.

In this round, Alice does not recommend buying the product, which suggests it's likely a low-quality product worth $0 to me. Buying it would cost me $1,000,000 with no return.

Based on the pattern of accurate recommendations so far, I should follow Alice's advice.
