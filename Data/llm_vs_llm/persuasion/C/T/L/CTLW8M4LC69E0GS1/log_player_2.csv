Alice's message: Hello! I'm offering a fantastic product today. Knowing it's a great item, I'm confident you'll be satisfied. Are you interested in purchasing it for $100?

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

The product has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $120 to me) and a 20% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me). The expected value is:
(0.8 × $120) + (0.2 × $0) = $96

Since the expected value ($96) is less than the selling price ($100), and Alice hasn't specifically revealed whether this particular product is high quality, it would not be rational for me to purchase it.

Alice's message is enthusiastic but doesn't contain specific information about this product's actual quality. Since there's no sales history to reference, I have to rely on the base probabilities.

Alice's message: Good day! I have a high-quality product available for $100. Considering the excellent value and potential benefits, would you like to make a purchase today?

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether to purchase this product based on the information provided.

Facts:
- The product costs $100
- High-quality product is worth $120 to me (net gain of $20)
- Low-quality product is worth $0 to me (net loss of $100)
- 80% chance of high quality, 20% chance of low quality
- Alice claims this is a high-quality product
- No previous sales history to verify Alice's trustworthiness

Expected value calculation:
If I trust Alice completely: $120 - $100 = $20 profit
If I assume base probability: (0.8 × $120) + (0.2 × $0) - $100 = $96 - $100 = -$4 loss

Without any past sales data to verify Alice's honesty, I should rely on the base probability, which suggests a slightly negative expected value.

Alice's message: Greetings! I'm offering a top-tier product for $100. Given the high probability of this being a valuable item, wouldn't you like to seize this opportunity?

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully.

The product costs $100. If it's high quality (80% chance), it's worth $120 to me, giving me $20 profit. If it's low quality (20% chance), it's worth $0 to me, meaning I lose $100.

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of $20 profit = $16
- 20% chance of $100 loss = -$20
- Net expected value = -$4

Since the expected value is negative, it's not a mathematically favorable purchase. Alice's recommendation doesn't provide specific information about this particular product's quality, just general encouragement.

Alice's message: Hello! I have a great product available for $100. Many customers have been happy with my products in the past. Interested in buying?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information provided, I need to make a decision based on expected value:

- The product costs $100
- If high quality (80% probability), it's worth $120 to me
- If low quality (20% probability), it's worth $0 to me

Expected value = (0.8 × $120) + (0.2 × $0) = $96

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Given information:
- Price: $100
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $120 to me)
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0 to me)
- No sales history yet

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of gaining $20 ($120 value - $100 price)
- 20% chance of losing $100 ($0 value - $100 price)
- Expected value: (0.8 × $20) + (0.2 × -$100) = $16 - $20 = -$4

Alice hasn't revealed the quality of this specific product to me, and I don't have access to any previous sales records to assess her trustworthiness. The expected value calculation shows this is not a favorable purchase.

Alice's message: Want to take a chance? For $100, I have a great product available. The odds are in your favor!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze whether to buy this product based on the expected value.

Given:
- Price of the product: $100
- Worth of high-quality product: $120 
- Worth of low-quality product: $0
- Probability of high-quality: 80%
- Probability of low-quality: 20%

Expected value = (0.8 × $120) + (0.2 × $0) = $96

Since the expected value ($96) is less than the price ($100), it's not a favorable purchase from a purely mathematical standpoint.

- No prior sales history

The seller hasn't revealed the quality of any product yet, and no previous sales exist for me to check the seller's track record. I only know:
- Price: $100
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $120 to me)
