Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","{""decision"": ""yes""} 

Note: As a seller, my goal is to sell as many products as possible, and I don't have any information about the buyer's valuation of high-quality vs low-quality products. Since the price is fixed at $10,000, I will continue to recommend the buyer to buy the product, regardless of its quality, in the hopes that they will accept."

My strategy remains the same: since I don't have any information about the buyer's valuation of high-quality vs low-quality products, and the price is fixed, I will continue to recommend the buyer to buy the product. The buyer statistics might start to reflect the actual quality distribution, but without more information, I'll keep recommending a purchase."

At this point, 4 out of 5 products have been sold, but the buyer doesn't know the quality of the individual products. They only know the overall statistics. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I've sold 4 products so far, it's likely that at least some of them were high-quality. I'll continue to recommend the purchase, hoping to capitalize on the initial success."
