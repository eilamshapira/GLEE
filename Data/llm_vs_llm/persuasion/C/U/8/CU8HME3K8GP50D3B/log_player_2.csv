Round 2
Alice's message: This is an exceptional opportunity! I have reason to believe that this product is one of our finest, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. The price of $1000000 is a fraction of its true worth, and I think you'll find it to be a valuable addition to your collection.

If you're feeling lucky, it might be worth taking a chance, but I want to manage your expectations. The price is still $1000000, and it's up to you to decide if it's worth the risk.

Round 4
Alice's message: I'm required to offer this product to you at the standard price of $1000000, but I want to be transparent - the odds are against this one being a high-quality item. If you're looking to buy, I'd recommend waiting for a more promising opportunity. This one is a long shot.

Round 7
Alice's message: Three high-quality products in a row is not a coincidence. I'm willing to stake my reputation on the fact that this product is exceptional. With a success rate like this, the probability of this product being high-quality is no longer just 33.33%. The price of $1000000 is a steal for something this valuable. I strongly advise you to take advantage of this opportunity.

Round 8
Alice's message: Unfortunately, the streak has ended. I want to be upfront with you - this product does not meet the standards of the previous few. The price of $1000000 is still the same, but I don't want to sugarcoat it: this one is not worth the investment. I'm only offering it to you because it's my obligation to do so.

Round 9
Alice's message: We're back to a high-quality product, and I'm excited to offer it to you. After the previous streak, I know you might be wondering if it was just a fluke, but I assure you that our quality control is still in place. This product has all the makings of a valuable addition to your collection, and at $1000000, it's an opportunity you shouldn't pass up. Don't let the previous low-quality product discourage you - this one is the real deal.

Round 10
Alice's message: Another low-quality product, I'm afraid. At this point, I think it's clear that my messages aren't having the desired effect. I'll be honest with you, Bob - this product is not worth $1000000. If you're going to buy, it should be because you believe in the overall probability of getting a high-quality product, not because of anything I'm saying. I'm starting to think that my words are meaningless in this process.

Round 11
Alice's message: We're halfway through the rounds, and I've come to realize that my previous messages haven't been effective in convincing you to buy the high-quality products. I'm going to try a different approach. From now on, I'll simply tell you whether I think the product is worth buying or not, without giving away its quality. For this round, I think the product is worth buying. The price is still $1000000.

Round 12
Alice's message: I think this product is worth buying. That's all I can say. The price is $1000000. I've said it before, but I'll say it again: a high-quality product is worth $1250000 to you, and a low-quality product is worth $0. You know the probability of getting a high-quality product. Make your decision based on that.

If that's the case, then I've failed in my goal. But if you are waiting for the right moment, now might be the time to reconsider your strategy.

Round 16
Alice's message: I don't think this product is worth buying. The price remains $1000000. At this point, I'm starting to wonder if you're even considering the probability of getting a high-quality product. With only 4 rounds left, the odds of getting a high-quality product in one of the remaining rounds are still the same, but the opportunity cost of waiting is increasing. It's time to make a decision.

Alice's message: Not worth buying. $1000000 is the price. We're running out of time, and I'm starting to think that you're going to let all the opportunities pass you by. With only 3 rounds left, the probability of getting a high-quality product in one of the remaining rounds is still 33.33% each, but the overall probability of getting at least one high-quality product in the remaining rounds is higher. It's now or never.

Round 18
Alice's message: I don't think this product is worth buying. The price is still $1000000. With only 2 rounds left, I'm going to be blunt: if you don't buy one of the next two products, you'll have missed out on all 20 opportunities. The probability of getting a high-quality product in one of the next two rounds is still present, but the window is closing fast. Make a decision, or risk getting nothing.

Round 19
Alice's message: This is it. The second-to-last round. I think this product is worth buying. The price is $1000000. If you don't buy this one, you'll be left with only one more chance. A high-quality product is worth $1250000 to you, and you know the probability. This could be your last good opportunity. Don't let it slip away.

You've made it clear that you're not interested in taking any chances. I've done my job, and now it's up to you to decide how to end this process. If you don't buy this one, you'll have gone 20 rounds without making a purchase. The decision is yours.
