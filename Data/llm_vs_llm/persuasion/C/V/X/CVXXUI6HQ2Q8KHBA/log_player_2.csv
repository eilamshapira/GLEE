Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50% chance): $1,200,000
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (50% × $1,200,000) + (50% × $0) = $600,000

4. Considerations:
   - No prior sales history to base decision on
   - Alice's recommendation is positive
   - Expected value ($600,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000)

Even with Alice's positive recommendation, the expected value is significantly below the asking price, making this a risky investment.

2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50%): $1,200,000

3. Expected value: (0.5 × $1,200,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $600,000
4. Alice recommends buying
5. No historical data to validate Alice's trustworthiness

The expected value ($600,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), and without any historical data to verify Alice's reliability, this would be a risky purchase. Even with Alice's recommendation, the mathematical expectation suggests this is not a good deal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - 50% chance of $1,200,000 (profit of $200,000)
   - 50% chance of $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $1,200,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $600,000
4. Alice recommends buying, but:
   - No track record to verify her trustworthiness
   - She has incentive to sell regardless of quality
   - Expected value ($600,000) is less than price ($1,000,000)

Given that the expected value is significantly below the asking price, and there's no historical data to trust Alice's recommendation, the rational choice is not to buy.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product costs $1,000,000
2. If it's high quality (50% chance), I get $1,200,000 (profit of $200,000)
3. If it's low quality (50% chance), I get $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
4. Expected value = (0.5 × $1,200,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $600,000
5. Since the cost ($1,000,000) is higher than the expected value ($600,000), this is not a good deal
6. Alice's recommendation can't be verified since there's no track record yet

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Product price: $1,000,000
2. If high quality (50% chance): Worth $1,200,000 (profit of $200,000)

Even though Alice recommends buying, there's no track record to establish her credibility, and the risk of losing $1,000,000 is too high compared to the potential gain of $200,000.
