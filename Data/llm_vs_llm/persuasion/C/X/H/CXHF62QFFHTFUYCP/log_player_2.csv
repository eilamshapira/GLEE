Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my reasoning:

* **Prior Probability:** Without any information, the probability of a product being high quality is 50%. Thus, the expected value of a randomly selected product is (0.5 * $1,250,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $625,000. This is significantly less than the asking price of $1,000,000, so buying blind would be a bad decision.

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice *doesn't* recommend buying. Since Alice knows the quality, her not recommending a purchase means the product is almost certainly low quality.

* **Statistics and Deception:** It's tempting to think about the 7 high-quality products sold so far and try to infer something about Alice's strategy. However, we must consider this a 'one-shot' game in the sense that our decision should not be based on other buyers.

Given Alice's negative recommendation, and her knowledge of the product quality, it is too risky to buy the product.

*   **Recommendation:** Alice does *not* recommend buying. This is critical information. Since Alice knows the quality and is acting against her own economic interest (selling the product), it strongly suggests the product is low quality. It's reasonable to assume Alice would recommend a high-quality product to increase the chance of a sale.

*   **Statistics:** The fact that 7 high-quality products were sold out of 13 doesn't change much. I don't know the full history and how many people Alice *didn't* recommend to buy. The negative recommendation is much stronger signal.

Given the negative recommendation, I will assume that the product is more likely to be a low quality one. Therefore, I will pass on the purchase.
