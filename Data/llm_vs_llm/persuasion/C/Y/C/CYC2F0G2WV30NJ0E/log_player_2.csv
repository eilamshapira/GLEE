"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Prior probability of high quality: 80%
2. Price: $1,000,000
3. Value if high quality: $2,000,000 (profit of $1,000,000)
4. Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
5. Alice doesn't recommend buying
6. No previous sales data to reference

Expected value without considering Alice's recommendation:
0.8 × $2,000,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $1,600,000

However, Alice's negative recommendation is concerning. Given she knows the true quality and is warning against purchase, this likely indicates it's a low-quality product.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected Value calculation:
* 80% chance of high quality: 0.8 × $2,000,000 = $1,600,000
* 20% chance of low quality: 0.2 × $0 = $0
* Total expected value: $1,600,000

2. Cost of product: $1,000,000

3. Expected profit: $1,600,000 - $1,000,000 = $600,000

Since the expected value ($1,600,000) is higher than the cost ($1,000,000), and Alice is recommending the purchase, it's rational to buy the product.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Prior probabilities:
- 80% chance of high quality
- 20% chance of low quality

2. Value assessment:
- High quality worth: $2,000,000
- Low quality worth: $0
- Price: $1,000,000

3. Additional information:
- Alice doesn't recommend buying
- Previous sale was high quality
- Only 1 previous buyer purchased

Given that Alice doesn't recommend the product, this likely indicates it's low quality. The fact that she was honest about a high-quality product before (1 out of 1 sold was high quality) suggests she's being truthful now.

Since a low-quality product would result in a $1,000,000 loss, and Alice's negative recommendation is a strong signal, I should not buy.

1. Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($2,000,000) = $1,600,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $1,600,000

2. Cost of product = $1,000,000

3. Historical data:
- One previous buyer purchased
- One high-quality product was sold
- This aligns with the stated probabilities

4. Current situation:
- Alice recommends buying
- Previous sale was successful
- Expected profit = $1,600,000 - $1,000,000 = $600,000

Since the expected value ($1,600,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($1,000,000), and Alice's previous recommendation led to a high-quality sale, this appears to be a good investment.
