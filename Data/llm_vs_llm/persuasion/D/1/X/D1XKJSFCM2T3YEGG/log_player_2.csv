"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze whether buying this product makes sense from an expected value perspective:

- If I buy: I pay $10,000
- If it's high quality (80% chance): I get $20,000 value (+$10,000 net)
- If it's low quality (20% chance): I get $0 value (-$10,000 net)

Expected value = (0.8 × $10,000) + (0.2 × -$10,000) = $8,000 - $2,000 = $6,000

Since the expected value is positive ($6,000), it's rational to buy the product regardless of Alice's recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to consider whether Alice's recommendation should change my decision.

The base expected value calculation remains:
- If I buy: I pay $10,000
- If it's high quality (80% chance): I get $20,000 value (+$10,000 net)
- If it's low quality (20% chance): I get $0 value (-$10,000 net)
- Expected value = $6,000 (positive)

Alice's recommendation against buying might suggest the product is more likely to be low quality. However, without knowing Alice's incentives or the reliability of her recommendations, the rational choice is still to rely on the base probabilities, which indicate a positive expected value.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to reconsider my strategy based on the outcomes we've seen.

So far, Alice's recommendations have aligned with the actual quality:
- Round 1: Alice recommended buying → High quality
- Round 2: Alice recommended buying → High quality  
- Round 3: Alice did not recommend buying → Low quality

It appears Alice may have truthful information about product quality. When she doesn't recommend buying, it might indicate she knows the product is low quality.

Given this pattern, and that Alice again doesn't recommend buying, I should take her recommendation seriously. If the product is likely low quality, my expected value would be negative.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.
