"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. If Alice doesn't recommend the product, it might suggest she knows it's low quality
2. The base probability is:
   * 80% chance of high quality (worth $400)
   * 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)
3. Expected value without any additional information would be:
   * (0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) - $100 = $220 profit
4. However, Alice's negative recommendation likely means the product is low quality
5. It's safer to pass when receiving a negative recommendation

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

3. Base probabilities are still:
   * 80% high quality (worth $400)
   * 20% low quality (worth $0)
4. Alice's previous honest recommendation increases the credibility of her current positive recommendation
5. Given her recommendation and the base probabilities, this seems like a good opportunity
6. Expected value should be higher than the base $220 due to the positive recommendation
