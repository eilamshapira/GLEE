Would you like to buy the current product?","To make a decision, we can analyze the information provided:

1. Alice has recommended the product to you. While Alice knows the true quality of the product, this recommendation could be strategic to maximize her sales.

2. There have been 2 buyers before you, both of whom purchased the product and both products were high quality. This suggests a high success rate so far with Alice's recommendations.

Given the sample size and the 100% high quality result so far, it seems likely that Alice might be recommending high-quality products, at least in this series of sales. However, the small sample size means this is not entirely reliable.

The expected value of a high-quality product is $3,000,000, and for this series of sales, the high-quality rate is 100%. Therefore, the expected outcome from buying this product (based on the recommendation and past statistics) is favorable compared to the purchase cost of $1,000,000.

Thus, it would be strategically sound to buy the product:

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make an informed decision, we need to consider the following:

1. Based on the sales record, all 3 products recommended by Alice and sold were high quality.
2. Alice recommends purchasing this product.

Given that Alice has a history of recommending high-quality products when she advises a purchase, there's a reason to place trust in her recommendation this time as well.

The expected value calculation based on this information:
- Chance of product being high quality given Alice's recommendation = Historically, 100% of recommended products were high quality.

Since a high-quality product is worth $3,000,000 and the price is $1,000,000, the expected value of a high-quality product is positive ($3,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $2,000,000).

Accordingly, the rational decision based on the statistics is to buy the product.
