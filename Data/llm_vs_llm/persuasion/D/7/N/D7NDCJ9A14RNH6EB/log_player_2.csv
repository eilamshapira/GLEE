Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $1,000,000
2. Expected value calculation:
   * 80% chance of high quality ($4,000,000) = $3,200,000
   * 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
   * Total expected value = $3,200,000

3. Risk assessment:
   * No previous sales history to validate seller's credibility
   * However, positive recommendation from Alice
   * Expected value ($3,200,000) is significantly higher than the price ($1,000,000)

Given that the expected value is more than 3 times the purchase price, even with no previous sales history, the potential return makes this a worthwhile investment.

1. Price: $1,000,000

   - Low quality (20% chance): $0
3. Expected value = (0.8 × $4,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $3,200,000

Previous statistics:
- 1 buyer before me
- 1 high-quality product sold
- Alice is recommending to buy

The expected value ($3,200,000) is significantly higher than the price ($1,000,000), and the historical data shows a positive track record with 100% high-quality products sold so far. Combined with Alice's positive recommendation, this appears to be a good investment opportunity.

2. Cost to buy = $1,000,000

3. Additional information:
* Previous sales record shows 2 buyers, both got high-quality products
* Alice is recommending to buy
* These positive indicators align with the high probability of good quality

4. Decision analysis:
* Expected value ($3,200,000) > Cost ($1,000,000)
* Historical data is positive
* Seller's recommendation is positive

Given that the expected value is significantly higher than the cost, and all indicators are positive, it's rational to buy.

4. Alice's recommendation:
- Alice is recommending the purchase
- Given her track record shows honesty (2/3 high quality), her recommendation carries weight

Since the expected value ($3,200,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($1,000,000), and Alice's recommendation aligns with a generally honest track record, this appears to be a profitable opportunity.

2. Expected value without additional information:

3. Sales history:
- 7 buyers purchased
- 4 high-quality products sold (57% high quality)
- This is lower than the base rate of 80%

4. Cost vs. Potential Return:
- Cost: $1,000,000
- Potential gain: $3,000,000 (if high quality)
- Potential loss: $1,000,000 (if low quality)

Despite the sales history showing a lower rate of high-quality products than expected, the seller's recommendation and the high base rate of 80% still make this a positive expected value purchase. The potential gain ($3,000,000) significantly outweighs the potential loss ($1,000,000).
