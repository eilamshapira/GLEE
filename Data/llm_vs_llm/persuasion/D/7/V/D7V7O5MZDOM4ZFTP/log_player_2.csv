Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Value:
   - High quality: $12,500 (33.33% chance)
   - Low quality: $0 (66.67% chance)
3. Expected value: ($12,500 × 0.3333) + ($0 × 0.6667) = $4,166.25
4. Alice, who knows the true quality, does not recommend buying
5. No previous sales history to reference

Given that Alice knows the true value and is not recommending the purchase, plus the fact that the expected value ($4,166.25) is well below the asking price ($10,000), this appears to be a risky purchase.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Possible values:
   - High quality (33.33%): $12,500
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0

3. Expected value without additional information:
   (33.33% × $12,500) + (66.67% × $0) = $4,167

4. Alice knows the true value and is not recommending the purchase.
   - Given she knows the true value and is not recommending it, this suggests it's more likely to be low quality.

Since:
- The expected value without information ($4,167) is already below the price ($10,000)
- Alice's negative recommendation further suggests it's likely low quality
- There's no prior sales history to consider

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33%): $12,500
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (33.33% × $12,500) + (66.67% × $0) = $4,166.25

4. Alice knows the true value and does NOT recommend buying
   - Given Alice's direct knowledge and negative recommendation, this strongly suggests the product is low quality

5. Decision factors:
   - Expected value ($4,166.25) is less than price ($10,000)
   - Seller's negative recommendation
   - High risk of loss

Given these factors, especially Alice's negative recommendation when she knows the true quality, it would be unwise to purchase.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this logically:

1. The product costs $10,000
2. If high quality (33.33% chance), it's worth $12,500 (profit of $2,500)
3. If low quality (66.67% chance), it's worth $0 (loss of $10,000)
4. Alice knows the true value and doesn't recommend buying
5. Alice's recommendation likely means it's low quality

Given that:
- Alice has no sales history yet to establish trustworthiness
- She's not recommending the purchase
- The expected value without any additional information would already be negative:
  (33.33% × $12,500 + 66.67% × $0) = $4,166 < $10,000

With Alice's negative recommendation, it's even more likely to be low quality.

2. Potential value:

4. Additional information:
   - Alice doesn't recommend buying
   - Alice knows the true value
   - Alice's recommendation is presumably intended to be helpful

Given that Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. Since a low-quality product is worth $0, and the price is $10,000, it would be unwise to buy.

1. The base probability is 33.33% for high quality ($12,500) and 66.67% for low quality ($0)

3. Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying
4. There's no prior sales history to reference

Given that Alice knows the true value and is not recommending the purchase, it's very likely that this is a low-quality product. If it were high quality (worth $12,500), Alice would have an incentive to recommend it since the sale would benefit both parties.

The fact that Alice is not recommending it strongly suggests this is a low-quality product worth $0, which would make purchasing it for $10,000 a bad decision.
