Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether to buy this product based on the information provided.

Given:
- Price: $1,000,000
- High-quality probability: 33.33% (worth $4,000,000 to me)
- Low-quality probability: 66.67% (worth $0 to me)
- Alice recommends buying the product
- No previous sales data exists

Expected value calculation:
0.3333 × $4,000,000 + 0.6667 × $0 = $1,333,200

Since Alice knows the true quality and is recommending purchase, this might suggest the product is high quality. However, I have no history to verify if Alice's recommendations are trustworthy.

The expected value ($1,333,200) is greater than the price ($1,000,000), so purchasing has a positive expected value even without considering Alice's recommendation.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'll analyze this situation carefully.

Given information:
- Price: $1,000,000
- High-quality product value: $4,000,000 (33.33% chance)
- Low-quality product value: $0 (66.67% chance)
- Alice has sold to 1 buyer so far, and that was a high-quality product
- Alice is recommending I buy this product

Expected value calculation without additional information:
(0.3333 × $4,000,000) + (0.6667 × $0) - $1,000,000 = $333,200

However, Alice has recommended I buy, and her previous sale was high-quality. This suggests her recommendations might be reliable. If I trust her recommendation, the product is more likely to be high-quality, making the purchase profitable.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to carefully consider this decision based on the information provided.

Alice has sold 2 products so far, and both were high quality. This suggests she has a track record of selling good products. However, for my specific product, Alice is not recommending the purchase.

Given that Alice knows the true quality of each product and knows its value to me, her recommendation not to buy suggests this product is likely low quality. Since a low-quality product would be worth $0 to me (while costing $1,000,000), following her recommendation seems prudent in this case.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

The base probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, which would give an expected value of:
(0.3333 × $4,000,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $1,333,200

This is higher than the asking price of $1,000,000, so if I only had the base probability to go on, buying would be rational.

However, I have two additional pieces of information:
1. Alice doesn't recommend buying this product
2. Alice has sold 2 products so far, and both were high-quality

Since Alice knows the true quality of each product, her recommendation carries information. The fact that she advised against buying suggests this product is likely low quality. Additionally, the fact that 2/2 previous products were high quality (when only 1/3 should be high quality on average) suggests Alice may be strategically recommending only high-quality products.

Given Alice's negative recommendation about my product, and her track record of only selling high-quality products so far, I should trust her recommendation that this particular product is not worth buying.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze whether Alice's recommendation is credible based on the information provided.

Given:
- A high-quality product is worth $4,000,000 to me (expected value: 0.3333 × $4,000,000 = $1,333,333)
- The price is $1,000,000
- Alice has sold 2 products so far, both high-quality
- Alice is recommending I buy this product

Alice appears to have been honest with previous buyers, selling only high-quality products. This suggests her recommendation may be trustworthy. The expected value of a random product ($1,333,333) exceeds the asking price ($1,000,000), and with Alice's positive recommendation, the probability of this being a high-quality product likely increases further.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make my decision, I need to analyze the information provided:

1) Prior probability of high-quality: 33.33%
2) Price: $1,000,000
3) Value to me: $4,000,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
4) Alice's track record: 3 buyers purchased, 3 high-quality products sold
5) Alice's recommendation for me: Do not buy

It's notable that Alice has a perfect record of selling high-quality products so far. However, Alice is now recommending that I don't buy the product. Given that Alice knows the true quality and has been honest with previous buyers, this strongly suggests the product is low quality.

If I buy a low-quality product, I would pay $1,000,000 for something worth $0 to me - a significant loss.

Based on this analysis, I should follow Alice's recommendation.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this carefully:

- Prior probability: Any product has a 33.33% chance of being high quality
- Price: $1,000,000
- Value to me: $4,000,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Alice's track record: 3 buyers purchased, and 3 high-quality products were sold
- Alice has recommended I buy the product

Since all previous buyers received high-quality products (3/3), and Alice is recommending I buy, this strongly suggests the product is high quality. With a high-quality product, my expected gain would be $3,000,000 ($4M value minus $1M cost).

The perfect track record so far is particularly compelling. Even though the base rate of high-quality products is only 33.33%, Alice's recommendation combined with her perfect track record significantly increases the probability this is a high-quality product.

- Alice knows the quality of each product
- Alice's track record: 4 buyers purchased products, and 4 high-quality products have been sold
- For the current product, Alice does not recommend buying

Alice's perfect record (4 for 4 high-quality products sold) suggests she has been truthful so far. The fact that she's not recommending this product strongly indicates it's low quality. If I were to buy it despite her recommendation, I'd likely get a low-quality product worth $0 to me, resulting in a loss of $1,000,000.

This situation is suspicious. Alice has only sold high-quality products so far (5/5), which is highly unlikely given the 33.33% base probability. This perfect record suggests Alice is selectively recommending only high-quality products.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully. 

First, let's review what I know:
- Each product has a 33.33% prior probability of being high quality
- Alice has sold 5 products so far, and all 5 were high quality
- Alice does NOT recommend that I buy the current product
- A high-quality product would give me $4,000,000 value (for $1,000,000 cost)
- A low-quality product would give me $0 value (for $1,000,000 cost)

The fact that Alice has only sold high-quality products suggests she's being truthful with her recommendations. If she is being honest and doesn't recommend this product, it strongly signals that this is a low-quality product.

Given that Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend it, and her track record shows she's been honest so far (5/5 high quality products sold), I should trust her recommendation.

So far, Alice has sold 5 products, and all 5 were high quality. This is unusual given that only 33.33% of products should be high quality according to the game's rules. This suggests Alice has been selectively recommending only high-quality products to buyers.

However, Alice is now explicitly NOT recommending this product to me. Given her perfect track record of selling only high-quality products, her recommendation not to buy strongly suggests this current product is low quality.

Interestingly, 5 buyers purchased products and all 5 received high-quality products, which is unusual given the baseline 33.33% probability of high quality. This suggests Alice may be honest in her recommendations.

- 6 buyers purchased products based on Alice's recommendations
- 6 high-quality products have been sold (100% high quality in sales history)

The fact that all 6 previous sales were high-quality products suggests Alice's recommendations have been reliable. Given the prior sales record and Alice's current recommendation, it's reasonable to infer this product is likely high quality as well.

Expected value calculation:
