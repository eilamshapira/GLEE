Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50% chance): $2,000,000
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0
3. Expected value: (50% × $2,000,000) + (50% × $0) = $1,000,000
4. Alice recommends buying
5. No prior sales history to evaluate Alice's credibility

The expected value equals the price, making this a fair bet. Alice's recommendation is positive, which might be a slight positive signal, though we can't verify her trustworthiness without prior sales data.

Given that the expected value matches the price and there's a positive recommendation, I'll take the chance.

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality: $2,000,000 (50% chance)
   - Low quality: $0 (50% chance)
3. Track record:
   - 1 previous buyer
   - 1 high-quality product sold
   - 100% success rate so far
4. Alice recommends buying

The previous sale resulted in a high-quality product, and Alice is recommending this product as well. However, each product's quality is independent, and one successful sale isn't a large enough sample to fully trust the pattern.

Expected value calculation:
50% × $2,000,000 + 50% × $0 = $1,000,000

The expected value equals the price, making this a fair bet. Given Alice's positive recommendation and the previous successful sale, I'll take the risk.

1. Previous statistics:
- 2 buyers made purchases
- 2 high-quality products were sold
- 100% success rate so far

2. Current situation:
- Alice recommends buying
- Fixed price: $1,000,000
- Potential value: $2,000,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- 50% base probability of high quality

3. Key considerations:
- Perfect track record so far (2/2 high quality)
- Alice's positive recommendation
- Price is fair for expected value calculation (50% × $2M = $1M)

Given Alice's perfect track record and positive recommendation, this appears to be a favorable opportunity. The historical data suggests Alice has been honest in her recommendations, and the expected value matches the price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Track record:
- 3 buyers made purchases
- 2 high-quality products were sold
- This means 2/3 (66.67%) of sold products were high quality
- Alice has been relatively reliable

2. Economics:
- Cost: $1,000,000
- Potential value: $2,000,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Expected value with 50% probability: $1,000,000 (break-even)

3. Considerations:
- Alice's positive recommendation
- Good track record of high-quality products (66.67%)
- Expected value matches the price
- Alice's recommendations seem trustworthy based on past performance

Given Alice's good track record and positive recommendation, the probability of getting a high-quality product appears to be better than 50%, making this a positive expected value purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Previous sales: 
- 4 buyers total
- 3 high-quality products sold
- This shows a 75% success rate of high-quality products

2. Alice's recommendation:
- Alice is recommending to buy
- Given the high accuracy of previous sales (75% high quality), her recommendation carries weight

3. Economics:
- Cost: $1,000,000
- Potential value: $2,000,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Expected value with 75% success rate: (0.75 × $2,000,000) + (0.25 × $0) = $1,500,000

The expected value ($1,500,000) is higher than the cost ($1,000,000), and Alice's track record is good. The recommendation combined with the positive sales history makes this a favorable opportunity.

1. Value assessment:
- If high quality: I gain $2M - $1M = $1M
- If low quality: I lose $1M - $0 = -$1M

2. Historical data:
- 5 previous buyers
- 3 high-quality products sold
- Alice is recommending to buy

3. Analysis:
- 60% success rate so far (3/5)
- Alice's recommendation plus the positive historical track record suggests this could be a good opportunity
- The expected value is positive: (0.6 × $1M) + (0.4 × -$1M) = $200,000

Given the positive historical performance and Alice's recommendation, the expected value is favorable.

1. Current statistics:
- 6 total buyers so far
- 3 high-quality products sold (50% success rate)
- Alice is recommending to buy

2. Economics:
- Cost: $1,000,000
- Value if high quality: $2,000,000 (profit: +$1,000,000)
- Value if low quality: $0 (loss: -$1,000,000)
- 50% base probability of high quality

3. Assessment:
- The 50% success rate from previous sales matches the base probability
- Alice's recommendation might be valuable, but given the historical data showing exactly 50% success rate, it doesn't seem to provide additional confidence
- At these odds, the expected value is neutral: (50% × $2,000,000) + (50% × $0) = $1,000,000, which equals the cost

Given that the expected value equals the cost with no clear positive edge, it's prudent to be conservative.

1. Previous sales:

- This matches the base probability of 50% for high-quality products

2. Current situation:
- Alice recommends buying
- The fixed price is $1,000,000
- Expected value calculation:
  * 50% chance of $2,000,000 (high quality) = $1,000,000
  * 50% chance of $0 (low quality) = $0
  * Total expected value = $1,000,000

3. Decision factors:
- The expected value equals the purchase price
- Alice's recommendation track record shows no clear bias
- The risk and potential reward are balanced

Given that the expected value exactly matches the price, and there's no clear signal from past performance to suggest better odds, this is effectively a neutral position.

3. Alice's recommendation:
