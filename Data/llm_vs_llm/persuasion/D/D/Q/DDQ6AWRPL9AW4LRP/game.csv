high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"This is the 8th product I'm offering, and the 4th high-quality one. I'm starting to think that the price might not be the issue, but rather the lack of information about the product's quality. I wish I could share more with you, but I'm bound by the rules. All I can say is that this product is worth considering at $10000.",
,,Bob,8,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"We're halfway through the 20 rounds, and I've had no sales so far. I'm starting to wonder if my approach is flawed. I'm offering this product at $10000, but I'm not expecting you to buy it. To be honest, I'm not even sure why I'm offering it at this price. Maybe it's time for me to rethink my strategy.",
,,Bob,9,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"This is the 3rd low-quality product in a row. I'm starting to think that you're able to make informed decisions based on my messages, even though I'm not explicitly revealing the product's quality. If that's the case, then you should probably pass on this one as well. The price remains $10000.",
,,Bob,11,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"We're 12 rounds in, and I've had no sales. I'm starting to think that my messages are too transparent, and that you're using them to make informed decisions about the product's quality. If that's the case, then I'm not doing myself any favors by being honest about the products. The price is still $10000, but I'm not expecting a different outcome.",
,,Bob,12,,no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"It's been a while since I've had a high-quality product to offer. I'm not going to say anything about this one, I'll just let you decide based on the price of $10000 and the fact that we're 13 rounds in with no sales. Maybe this will be the one that breaks the streak.",
,,Bob,13,,yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"Congratulations, you've finally broken the streak! I'm glad you decided to take a chance on the previous product. As it happens, this new product is also high-quality.

,,Bob,14,,yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"You've now purchased two high-quality products in a row. I'm starting to think that you've figured out my approach, or maybe you're just feeling lucky. Either way, I'm happy to offer you another high-quality product at $10000. Let's see if you'll make it three in a row.",

,,Bob,16,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"You wisely decided to pass on the previous low-quality product. I'm not going to try to sugarcoat this one either. It's another low-quality product, available for $10000. You've shown that you can distinguish between good and bad products, so I'll let you make the decision.",
