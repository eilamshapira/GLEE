Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 
   - 80% chance of high quality ($400)
   - 20% chance of low quality ($0)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320

4. Alice recommends buying the product
5. No previous sales history to reference

Since the expected value ($320) is significantly higher than the price ($100), and given the high probability of getting a high-quality product (80%), this appears to be a good deal, even without any sales history to verify Alice's trustworthiness.

3. If low quality (20% chance): Worth $0 (net loss: $100)
4. Previous record: 1 buyer, 1 high-quality sale
5. Alice's recommendation: Positive

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of $300 gain = $240
