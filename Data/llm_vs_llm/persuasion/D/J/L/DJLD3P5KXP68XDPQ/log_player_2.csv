Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to make a rational decision based on the expected value of the product.

Given information:
- Product costs $10,000
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $12,000 to me)
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0 to me)
- Alice recommends buying

Expected value calculation:
0.8 × $12,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $9,600

Since the expected value ($9,600) is less than the price ($10,000), buying would not be the rational choice, even with Alice's recommendation. Alice knows the true quality and has an incentive to recommend buying regardless of quality.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to decide whether to buy the product or not based on the available information.

Given:
- The product costs $10,000
- High-quality product (80% chance) is worth $12,000 to me
- Low-quality product (20% chance) is worth $0 to me
- Alice recommends buying the product
- No previous sales data is available

Expected value calculation:
0.8 × $12,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $9,600

Since the expected value ($9,600) is less than the price ($10,000), it's not a good deal based on the prior probabilities alone. Alice's recommendation could potentially change this calculation, but without knowing how reliable her recommendations are (since there's no sales history), I can't confidently adjust my assessment.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether it makes sense to buy the product based on the expected value.

Given information:
- 80% chance the product is high quality (worth $12,000)

- Price is $10,000
- Alice recommends buying the product

Expected value = (0.8 × $12,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $9,600

Since the expected value ($9,600) is less than the price ($10,000), it's not a profitable decision in the long run, even with Alice's recommendation. Without knowing if Alice's recommendations are trustworthy (no prior sales history), I should rely on the basic probability.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze the expected value of purchasing this product.

Given:
- Price: $10,000
- Value if high quality: $12,000

- Probability of high quality: 80%
- Probability of low quality: 20%

Expected value = (0.8 × $12,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $9,600

Since the expected value ($9,600) is less than the price ($10,000), the product has a negative expected value for me, regardless of Alice's recommendation.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to decide whether to buy the product or not based on the available information.

Facts:
- The product has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $12,000 to me) and 20% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me).
- The price is fixed at $10,000.
- Alice recommends that I buy the product.
- There are no previous sales statistics yet.

Expected value calculation:
0.8 × $12,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $9,600

Since the expected value ($9,600) is less than the price ($10,000), it's not a good deal based on just the prior probability.

Alice's recommendation might be informative, but without knowing her incentives or past recommendation accuracy, I can't rely on it to change the expected value calculation significantly.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","In this case, I need to make a decision based on the prior probability, the product price, and Alice's recommendation.

The product has a 80% chance of being high quality (worth $12,000) and 20% chance of being low quality (worth $0).
Expected value without any recommendation = 0.8 × $12,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $9,600
Price = $10,000

Since there's no sales history yet, I can't use that information. Alice does not recommend buying the product, which suggests it might be low quality.

Given that the expected value ($9,600) is less than the price ($10,000) even before considering Alice's negative recommendation, I should not buy the product.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully.

- The product costs $10,000
- A high-quality product is worth $12,000 to me (profit of $2,000)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- The prior probability is 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice has recommended that I buy the product
- There is no previous sales history to evaluate Alice's recommendations

The expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of gaining $2,000 = $1,600
- 20% chance of losing $10,000 = -$2,000
- Net expected value = -$400

Given that Alice knows the true quality and has recommended purchase, this might improve the odds. However, without prior history of Alice's recommendation patterns, I can't reliably adjust my probability estimate based on her recommendation alone.

Based on the prior probabilities, the expected value is negative, so I should decline.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to think through this decision carefully.

The product costs $10,000.
- If it's high quality, it's worth $12,000 to me (profit of $2,000)
- If it's low quality, it's worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)

There's an 80% chance of high quality and 20% chance of low quality.
Expected value = 0.8 × $12,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $9,600

Alice recommends buying, but I have no past data on her recommendations. The expected value ($9,600) is less than the price ($10,000), so purely based on expected value, buying isn't profitable.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to carefully consider this decision.

The product costs $10,000.
- If high quality (80% chance): I gain $12,000 in value, for a net profit of $2,000
- If low quality (20% chance): I gain $0 in value, for a net loss of $10,000

My expected value = (0.8 × $2,000) + (0.2 × -$10,000) = $1,600 - $2,000 = -$400

The expected value is negative, which suggests I shouldn't buy. However, Alice knows the product quality and is recommending I buy it. If I assume Alice is honest in her recommendation, this increases the likelihood the product is high quality.

Given the recommendation and the 80% prior probability of high quality, I'll take the risk.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully.

Given information:
- Fixed price: $10,000
- High-quality product value: $12,000 (80% chance)
- Low-quality product value: $0 (20% chance)
- Alice knows product quality
- Alice does not recommend buying this product
- Previous record: 1 buyer purchased, and 1 high-quality product was sold

The key factor here is Alice's recommendation. Since Alice knows the product quality and is not recommending purchase, this is a strong signal that this particular product is low quality. This outweighs the general 80% probability of high quality.

If I were to buy a low-quality product, I would pay $10,000 for something worth $0 to me, resulting in a $10,000 loss.

Based on Alice's negative recommendation and knowledge of the product quality, I should decline.

- The product costs $10,000
- High-quality product is worth $12,000 to me (profit of $2,000)
- Low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice has sold 1 product so far, and it was high quality
- Alice is recommending I buy the product

Given Alice's recommendation and her perfect track record (1/1 high quality products), this strengthens my belief that the product is high quality. The expected value calculation favors purchasing:
- 80% chance of $2,000 profit = $1,600
- 20% chance of $10,000 loss = -$2,000
- Net expected value = -$400

However, Alice knows the true quality and is making a recommendation. Since she has only recommended high quality products so far, this increases my confidence above the prior probability. The expected value becomes positive with this additional information.

Key facts:
- Prior probability of high quality: 80%
- Price: $10,000
- Value to me: $12,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Alice doesn't recommend buying this product
- Alice has sold 2 products so far, both high quality

Alice's recommendation is likely informative since she knows the true quality. The fact that she doesn't recommend buying suggests this product is low quality. Additionally, the previous 2 products were high quality, which aligns with the expected 80% rate but could also indicate that I'm more likely to get the low quality one now.

Given Alice's negative recommendation about this specific product, I should not buy it.

- Prior probability: 80% chance of high quality, 20% chance of low quality
- Alice has recommended 2 products so far, and both were high quality
- Alice recommends that I buy the current product

Since Alice has been honest with her previous recommendations (2/2 were high quality), and she's recommending I buy this product too, this suggests the product is likely high quality. The prior probability of 80% high quality combined with her positive track record and current recommendation makes buying the product a reasonable decision.

- The price is fixed at $10,000
- So far, 3 buyers have purchased based on Alice's recommendations, and all 3 received high-quality products
- Alice is now recommending that I buy the current product

This is a positive sign that Alice's recommendations seem honest. If I buy:
- Expected value = 0.8 × $12,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $9,600
- Cost = $10,000
- Expected profit = $9,600 - $10,000 = -$400

- Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice has sold 4 products so far, and all 4 were high quality

Alice's perfect record of selling only high-quality products and her recommendation to buy suggest this product is likely high quality. The expected value is positive:
(0.8 × $2,000) + (0.2 × -$10,000) = $1,600 - $2,000 = -$400

3) A high-quality product is worth $12,000 to me

5) Alice hasn't recommended this product to me
6) Alice has a perfect record so far - 5/5 high-quality products sold

Even though the prior probability favors high quality (80%), Alice's recommendation contains valuable information. Given that Alice knows the true quality and all her previous recommendations led to high-quality products, her negative recommendation for me is a strong signal that this product is likely low quality.

If I were to ignore her recommendation, my expected value would be:
0.8 × $12,000 + 0.2 × $0 - $10,000 = $9,600 - $10,000 = -$400

But considering Alice's negative recommendation, the actual probability of high quality is likely much lower than 80%, making the expected value even worse.
