Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Product price: $1,000,000
2. Value if high quality (80% chance): $1,200,000
3. Value if low quality (20% chance): $0
4. Expected value = (0.8 × $1,200,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $960,000

The expected value ($960,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), even with Alice's recommendation. Since I have no prior sales data to verify Alice's trustworthiness, and the expected value is lower than the price, it would be financially prudent to decline.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Expected value calculation:
* 80% chance of high quality ($1,200,000) = $960,000
* 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
* Total expected value = $960,000

2. Cost of product = $1,000,000

3. Additional factors:
* Alice is recommending to buy
* No previous sales history to verify Alice's reliability
* The expected value ($960,000) is less than the cost ($1,000,000)

Since the expected value is less than the cost, and there's no track record to trust Alice's recommendation, it would be financially unwise to purchase.

Given that the expected value is less than the purchase price, it would not be rational to buy.
