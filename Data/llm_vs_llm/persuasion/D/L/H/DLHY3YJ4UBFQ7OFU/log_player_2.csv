Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Cost of product: $100
2. Value if high quality: $125 (profit of $25)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $100)
4. Base probability: 33.33% high quality, 66.67% low quality
5. Alice's recommendation: Positive
6. No historical data to reference

Even with Alice's positive recommendation, the expected value calculation based on base probabilities is:
(0.3333 × $125) + (0.6667 × $0) = $41.66

Since the cost is $100, and the expected value is only $41.66, it would not be rational to buy the product. Alice's incentive is to sell regardless of quality, so her recommendation alone isn't enough to overcome the negative expected value.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality (33.33%): $125 (profit of $25)
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0 (loss of $100)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (0.3333 × $125) + (0.6667 × $0) - $100 = $41.66 - $100 = -$58.34

4. Alice's recommendation: Positive
   However, since Alice has no track record yet, we can't evaluate her trustworthiness.

Even with Alice's recommendation, the expected value is negative, and there's no historical data to suggest Alice is trustworthy. The risk of losing $100 is too high compared to the potential gain of $25.

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $125

3. Expected value without Alice's recommendation:
   (0.3333 × $125) + (0.6667 × $0) = $41.66

4. Alice's recommendation is positive, but:
   - She has no track record yet
   - She knows the true quality
   - She has an incentive to sell regardless of quality

Even with Alice's recommendation, the expected value ($41.66) is still less than the price ($100). Without a proven track record of honest recommendations, it's too risky.

   - There's no track record to verify Alice's trustworthiness

   - The expected value is less than the price

Given that the expected value is significantly below the asking price ($41.67 vs $100), and there's no historical data to trust Alice's recommendation, it would be risky to buy.
