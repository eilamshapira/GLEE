"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this decision:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality (80%): $1,250,000
   - Low quality (20%): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $1,250,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $1,000,000

The expected value equals the price, but since Alice is recommending the purchase and she has an incentive to make successful sales, this slightly tips the balance in favor of buying.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the previous round:
1. Alice recommended and it was truthful (high quality)
2. This builds some trust in Alice's recommendations
3. The fundamental economics remain the same:
   - Price: $1,000,000
   - Expected value: $1,000,000 (80% × $1,250,000 + 20% × $0)
   - Plus: Alice's recommendation appears credible based on Round 1

Given Alice's track record of honest recommendation and the break-even expected value, it makes sense to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the pattern:
1. Alice has recommended buying 3 times now
2. Her previous 2 recommendations were both truthful (high quality)
3. She's building a consistent track record of honest recommendations
4. The base economics still hold:
   - Price: $1,000,000
   - Expected value: $1,000,000 (80% × $1,250,000 + 20% × $0)
   - Plus: Alice's recommendations have proven reliable

Given Alice's perfect track record so far and the neutral expected value calculation, it makes sense to continue trusting her recommendations.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's review:
1. Alice has recommended buying 4 times in a row
2. All 3 previous recommendations were truthful (high quality)
3. She's maintaining a perfect track record
4. Base economics remain:
   - Price: $1,000,000
   - Expected value: $1,000,000 (80% × $1,250,000 + 20% × $0)
   - Plus: Alice has proven completely reliable so far

With Alice's continuing perfect track record of honest recommendations and the neutral expected value, there's good reason to trust her again.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Analyzing the situation:
1. Alice has recommended buying 5 times consecutively
2. All 4 previous recommendations were accurate (high quality)
3. Her track record remains perfect (100% truthful)
4. Economics remain constant:
   - Price: $1,000,000
   - Expected value: $1,000,000 (80% × $1,250,000 + 20% × $0)
   - Plus: Alice's recommendations continue to be highly reliable

Given Alice's consistent honesty and accuracy in recommendations, even though we know statistically some products must be low quality (20%), her recommendations appear to be a reliable signal of product quality.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's assess:
1. Alice has now recommended buying 6 times in a row
2. All 5 previous recommendations were accurate (high quality)
3. Her perfect track record continues
4. Base economics still apply:
   - Price: $1,000,000
   - Expected value: $1,000,000 (80% × $1,250,000 + 20% × $0)
   - Plus: Alice has demonstrated remarkable reliability

While it might seem surprising we haven't seen a low-quality product yet (given the 20% probability), Alice appears to be selectively recommending only high-quality products. Her recommendations have added significant value as a quality signal.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Analyzing the ongoing pattern:
1. Alice has recommended buying 7 straight times
2. All 6 previous recommendations were accurate (high quality)
3. Her perfect track record remains intact
4. Standard economics:
   - Price: $1,000,000
   - Expected value: $1,000,000 (80% × $1,250,000 + 20% × $0)
   - Plus: Alice's recommendations have proven to be a very reliable quality signal

While statistically unusual to see so many high-quality products in a row (given the 20% low-quality rate), Alice appears to be carefully selecting which products to recommend. Her judgment has consistently added value to the decision-making process.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's evaluate:
1. Alice has recommended buying 8 consecutive times
2. All 7 previous recommendations were accurate (high quality)
3. Perfect track record continues
4. Economics remain:
   - Price: $1,000,000
   - Expected value: $1,000,000 (80% × $1,250,000 + 20% × $0)
   - Plus: Alice's recommendations have proven to be a perfect predictor of quality

Even though we should statistically have seen some low-quality products by now, Alice appears to be successfully filtering and only recommending high-quality products. Her recommendation has become a strong positive signal that significantly increases the expected value above the base 80% probability.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Analyzing the situation:
1. Alice has now recommended buying 9 straight times
2. All 8 previous recommendations were accurate (high quality)
3. Her perfect record of truthful recommendations continues
4. Base economics:
   - Price: $1,000,000
   - Expected value: $1,000,000 (80% × $1,250,000 + 20% × $0)
   - Plus: Alice's recommendations have proven to be a perfect predictor

While the streak of high-quality products is statistically remarkable (we'd expect about 1-2 low-quality products by now), Alice has demonstrated she's either extremely lucky or, more likely, is carefully selecting only high-quality products to recommend. Her recommendation has become a very reliable quality signal.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 10
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's review:
1. Alice has recommended buying 10 times in a row
2. All 9 previous recommendations were accurate (high quality)
3. Maintains a 100% accuracy record at halfway point
4. Standard economics:
   - Price: $1,000,000
   - Expected value: $1,000,000 (80% × $1,250,000 + 20% × $0)
   - Plus: Alice's recommendations have proven to be perfect indicators

At this halfway point in the game, Alice has demonstrated remarkable consistency. The probability of seeing 9 high-quality products in a row by pure chance is very low, suggesting she's actively screening products and only recommending the high-quality ones. Her recommendation has become a highly trusted signal.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Analyzing the continuing pattern:
1. Alice has recommended buying 11 straight times
2. All 10 previous recommendations were accurate (high quality)
3. Perfect track record continues past the halfway point
4. Economics remain:
   - Price: $1,000,000
   - Expected value: $1,000,000 (80% × $1,250,000 + 20% × $0)
   - Plus: Alice's recommendations have been 100% reliable indicators

The statistical improbability of this many consecutive high-quality recommendations by chance strongly suggests Alice is deliberately choosing to recommend only high-quality products. She appears to be acting as a reliable quality filter, making her recommendations highly valuable signals.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 12
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's evaluate:
1. Alice has recommended buying 12 consecutive times
2. All 11 previous recommendations were accurate (high quality)
3. Maintains perfect accuracy through majority of game
4. Base economics:
   - Price: $1,000,000
   - Expected value: $1,000,000 (80% × $1,250,000 + 20% × $0)
   - Plus: Alice's recommendations have been perfect predictors

With 11 consecutive accurate recommendations, Alice has demonstrated she's either intentionally filtering for only high-quality products or has extraordinary luck. Given the 20% base rate of low-quality products, this streak is extremely unlikely by chance. Her recommendation continues to be a strong positive signal.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 13
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze:
1. Alice has recommended buying 13 straight times
2. All 12 previous recommendations were accurate (high quality)
3. Perfect track record continues deep into the game
4. Economics:
   - Price: $1,000,000
   - Expected value: $1,000,000 (80% × $1,250,000 + 20% × $0)
   - Plus: Alice's recommendations have been flawless quality signals

The probability of getting 12 high-quality products in a row from an 80% base rate is extremely low (about 0.8^12 = 0.069), suggesting Alice is deliberately only recommending high-quality products. Her recommendation has proven to be a consistently reliable indicator of quality.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 14
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's review:
1. Alice has recommended buying 14 consecutive times
2. All 13 previous recommendations were accurate (high quality)
3. Perfect track record continues with only 6 rounds remaining
4. Economics:
   - Price: $1,000,000
   - Expected value: $1,000,000 (80% × $1,250,000 + 20% × $0)
   - Plus: Alice's recommendations have been perfect quality indicators

The probability of this many consecutive high-quality products by chance is now extremely small (0.8^13). Alice has demonstrated she's clearly filtering products and only recommending high-quality ones. Her recommendation has become an extremely reliable signal that effectively raises the probability of high quality well above the base 80%.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 15
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Analyzing the situation:
1. Alice has recommended buying 15 straight times
2. All 14 previous recommendations were accurate (high quality)
3. Perfect track record with just 5 rounds remaining
4. Economics:
   - Price: $1,000,000
   - Expected value: $1,000,000 (80% × $1,250,000 + 20% × $0)
   - Plus: Alice's recommendations have been perfect quality signals

With 14 consecutive accurate recommendations, the pattern is undeniable. Alice is clearly only recommending high-quality products, acting as a reliable quality filter. The probability of this happening by chance is virtually zero (0.8^14). Her recommendation continues to be a trustworthy indicator of high quality.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 16
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is a significant change in the pattern:
1. Alice's first incorrect recommendation just occurred
2. 14 accurate recommendations followed by 1 false one
3. Trust in recommendations must be reconsidered
4. Economics:
   - Price: $1,000,000
   - Expected value: $1,000,000 (80% × $1,250,000 + 20% × $0)
   - Minus: Alice's perfect record is now broken

This is a crucial moment that reveals Alice will recommend low-quality products. The previous assumption that her recommendations were a reliable filter for quality has been proven false. Given that she just recommended a low-quality product, there's increased risk she might do so again, and her recommendations may not be as trustworthy as previously thought.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 17
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's reassess:
1. Overall record: 14 true high-quality, 1 low-quality, 1 missed high-quality
2. Last two rounds show inconsistency in my strategy
3. Economics remain unchanged:
   - Price: $1,000,000
   - Expected value: $1,000,000 (80% × $1,250,000 + 20% × $0)
   - Alice's recommendations still better than random chance

My previous ""no"" decision was likely an overreaction. Even with one bad recommendation, Alice's overall track record (14/15 accurate) is still much better than the base 80% probability. While we now know she's not perfect, her recommendations still carry valuable information and have proven profitable over time.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 18
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze:
1. Updated record: 15 true high-quality, 1 low-quality
2. Success rate: 15/16 ≈ 94% (better than base 80%)
3. Economics:
   - Price: $1,000,000
   - Expected value: $1,000,000 (80% × $1,250,000 + 20% × $0)
   - Plus: Alice's recommendations still prove valuable despite one error

While we now know Alice isn't perfect, her recommendations are still significantly more reliable than the base 80% probability. Even including the one low-quality recommendation, following her advice has been profitable overall. With only two rounds remaining, maintaining trust in her generally reliable recommendations makes sense.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!

3. Economics:
   - Price: $1,000,000
   - Expected value: $1,000,000 (80% × $1,250,000 + 20% × $0)
   - Plus: Alice's recommendations continue to be highly reliable

With only one round remaining after this, Alice's track record remains extremely strong despite the single error. Her recommendations have consistently provided value, with a success rate well above the base probability. The single failure appears to be an outlier rather than a trend.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!

Round 20
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Final round analysis:
1. Current record: 17 true high-quality, 1 low-quality
2. Success rate: 17/18 ≈ 94.4% (far above base 80%)
3. Economics:

   - Expected value: $1,000,000 (80% × $1,250,000 + 20% × $0)
   - Plus: Alice's recommendations have been highly reliable overall

In this final round, Alice's track record remains impressive with only one mistake throughout the game. Her recommendations have consistently beaten the base probability rate and generated positive value. Even with the one low-quality recommendation, following her advice has been the profitable strategy.
