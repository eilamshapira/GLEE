{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since this is the first product, there's no information on past sales to guide our decision. However, we know the following:

* **Alice is incentivized to recommend high-quality products:**  She knows the value of each product to us. If she recommends a product, it's more likely to be high-quality because she wants to make a sale. 
* **The odds are in our favor:** Even without Alice's recommendation, the product has an 80% chance of being high-quality, which is a significant advantage.

Given these factors, the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk of a low-quality one. Therefore, buying the product is the better decision."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has a perfect track record so far. She has only recommended one product, and it was high quality. While this is a small sample size, it is a strong indicator that Alice's recommendations are trustworthy.

Given the high potential payoff of a high-quality product ($1,250,000) and the low risk of a low-quality product ($0), it's in your best interest to accept Alice's recommendation and purchase the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice knows the quality of the product and recommends buying it. This is a strong signal in her favor, as she has a clear incentive to maximize her profit by selling high-quality products. 
* **Past sales data:** The fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers purchased the product and they were both high-quality suggests a high probability of this product also being high-quality. 

While there's still a 20% chance of the product being low-quality, the evidence strongly favors the product being high-quality. The potential reward of $250,000 (difference between the value to you and the price) outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has a perfect track record so far, having only sold high-quality products. Even though the inherent probability of getting a low-quality product is 20%, Alice's consistent recommendations for high-quality products suggest that she is either:

* **Perfectly discerning:** She can flawlessly identify high-quality products.
* **Manipulating the process:** She might be somehow influencing the selection process to guarantee high-quality products.

In either case, it's statistically advantageous to trust Alice's recommendation and buy the product."

* **Recommendation:** Given her perfect track record, Alice's recommendation to buy holds significant weight.  
* **Potential gain:**  Even though the product costs $1,000,000, it's worth $1,250,000 if it's high quality, making it a potentially lucrative purchase.

**While there's still a 20% chance the product is low quality, the strong evidence from Alice's previous recommendations makes buying the product the more rational choice.**"
