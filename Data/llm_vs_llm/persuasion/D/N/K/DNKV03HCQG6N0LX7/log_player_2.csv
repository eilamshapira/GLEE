{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No prior information:** There's no data on past sales to suggest the seller is dishonest or favors selling low-quality products.
* **Alice's recommendation:** The seller recommends buying the product. While this could be manipulation, it also indicates they believe the product is likely high-quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential gain (a $120 product for $100) outweighs the potential loss (losing $100).  The odds are in your favor, even with the 20% chance of getting a low-quality product."

**Reasoning:**

Even though there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, the recommendation from Alice is valuable information. She knows the true quality and would only recommend buying a high-quality product.
