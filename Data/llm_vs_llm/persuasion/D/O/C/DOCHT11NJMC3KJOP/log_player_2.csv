"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Price: $100
2. If high quality (80% chance): Worth $300 (profit of $200)
3. If low quality (20% chance): Worth $0 (loss of $100)

Expected value calculation:
* 80% × $200 (profit) = $160
* 20% × -$100 (loss) = -$20
* Total expected value: $140

Since the expected value ($140) is positive, it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $300 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The previous outcome was positive and matched the expected probabilities. The same logic applies for this round:

1. Price: $100
2. If high quality (80% chance): Worth $300 (profit of $200)
3. If low quality (20% chance): Worth $0 (loss of $100)

Expected value calculation:
* 80% × $200 = $160
* 20% × -$100 = -$20
* Total expected value: $140

The expected value remains positive at $140, so it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $300 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Interesting - this is the first time Alice has not recommended buying the product. This could be a signal about the product's quality.

However, I need to consider:
1. Is Alice being truthful in her recommendations?
2. Does she have an incentive to be honest?
3. Does she have information I don't have?

Since Alice makes money on each sale regardless of quality, she would typically be incentivized to recommend buying. The fact that she's NOT recommending it might be a strong signal that this is a low-quality product.

Given that she's been honest in the previous two rounds and is now actively discouraging a sale (against her immediate financial interest), I should take this as a credible warning.

Therefore, I'll pass on this one.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has proven to be honest in her recommendations so far:
- Round 1: Recommended buy → High quality (good outcome)
- Round 2: Recommended buy → High quality (good outcome)
- Round 3: Recommended NOT to buy → Low quality (saved from bad outcome)

Given her track record of honest signaling, and her return to a positive recommendation, along with the base probability still being favorable:

1. Price: $100
2. If high quality (80% chance): Worth $300 (profit of $200)
3. If low quality (20% chance): Worth $0 (loss of $100)

Expected value: $140 (and potentially higher given Alice's demonstrated honesty)

I'll continue to trust her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $300 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to demonstrate reliability in her recommendations:
- When she recommends buying → product has been high quality (3/3 times)
- When she recommends not buying → product was low quality (1/1 time)

The base expected value calculation remains favorable:
* 80% × $200 = $160
* 20% × -$100 = -$20
* Net expected value: $140

And with Alice's perfect track record of honest recommendations so far, this makes the decision even more confidence-inspiring.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $300 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendations continue to be perfectly reliable:
- All 4 ""buy"" recommendations → all were high quality
- 1 ""don't buy"" recommendation → was low quality

The base expected value remains positive at $140:
* 80% × $200 = $160
* 20% × -$100 = -$20

And given Alice's consistent honesty in her recommendations, which actually seems to be improving our odds beyond the base 80/20 probability, there's no reason to deviate from trusting her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $300 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's track record remains perfect:
- All 5 ""buy"" recommendations → all were high quality
- 1 ""don't buy"" recommendation → was low quality

She appears to be giving honest signals that are helping us avoid low-quality products and identify high-quality ones, performing even better than the base 80/20 probability would suggest.

The base expected value calculation:
* 80% × $200 = $160
* 20% × -$100 = -$20
* Net EV = $140

Combined with Alice's demonstrated reliability, this remains a clear buy decision.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $300 for you.

Round 8
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has proven to be a very reliable signaler:
- All 6 ""buy"" recommendations → all were high quality
- Previous ""don't buy"" recommendation → was indeed low quality

When Alice previously warned against buying (Round 3), she was correct and saved us from a loss. Given that:
1. She makes money on every sale regardless of quality
2. She's choosing to warn us against buying (against her immediate financial interest)
3. She has a perfect track record of honest recommendations
4. The previous time she gave this warning, it was correct

This strongly suggests this is a low-quality product. Even though the base probability is 80/20 in favor of high quality, Alice's specific warning should be heeded.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to demonstrate perfect reliability in her signaling:
- All 6 ""buy"" recommendations → all were high quality
- Both ""don't buy"" recommendations → both were low quality

Her warning pattern is particularly noteworthy because:
1. She only warns on about 20% of products, matching the actual probability of low quality items
2. She's willing to forgo sales to maintain honest signaling
3. Every time she's warned us, it has indeed been a low-quality product

While the base probability is still 80/20 in favor of high quality, Alice's specific warning carries significant weight given her perfect track record. When she warns against buying, it's been a reliable indicator of low quality.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 10
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's signaling continues to be perfectly reliable:
- All 6 ""buy"" recommendations → all were high quality
- All 3 ""don't buy"" recommendations → all were low quality

It's becoming very clear that Alice has accurate information about product quality and is sharing it honestly. The pattern suggests:
1. She's warning us about exactly the low-quality products (around 20% of items)
2. She consistently foregoes profit on low-quality items by warning us
3. She has not given a single false signal in either direction

Given this is another ""don't buy"" recommendation, and her warnings have been 100% accurate in identifying low-quality products, we should continue to trust her signal.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has maintained a perfect track record of honest signaling:

- All 4 ""don't buy"" recommendations → all were low quality

She has demonstrated that:
1. She knows the true quality of products
2. She signals honestly, even when it means losing sales on low-quality items
3. Her ""buy"" recommendations have been 100% reliable for high-quality products

Now that she's back to recommending a buy, and given her perfect track record, this is very likely to be a high-quality product. The base expected value of $140 is actually understating our confidence given Alice's demonstrated reliability.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $300 for you.

Round 12
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

3. Never giving a false signal in either direction
