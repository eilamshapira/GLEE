Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully:

1) The product costs $1,000,000
2) If high quality (80% chance), it's worth $4,000,000 to me
3) If low quality (20% chance), it's worth $0 to me
4) Alice recommends buying it
5) There's no sales history yet

The expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $4,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) - $1,000,000 = $3,200,000 - $1,000,000 = $2,200,000

Since the expected value is positive and significantly higher than the cost, and Alice has recommended buying (which aligns with the base probability), this appears to be a good purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether to buy this product based on the given information.

Here's what I know:
- Each product has an 80% chance of being high quality and 20% chance of being low quality
- A high-quality product is worth $4,000,000 to me (profit of $3,000,000)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000)
- Alice has sold 1 product so far, which was high quality
- Alice recommends that I buy the current product

Given Alice's recommendation and the prior success rate, the expected value calculation favors purchasing. Since the proportion of high-quality products sold remains at 100%, and Alice is recommending this product, it's reasonable to trust this recommendation.

Given:
- Product price: $1,000,000
- High-quality product value: $4,000,000
- Low-quality product value: $0
- Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Previous sales: 2 buyers, 2 high-quality products sold
- Alice recommends buying the product

The expected value of buying the product without any additional information would be:
0.8 × $4,000,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $3,200,000

Since Alice is recommending to buy and has a perfect track record so far (2/2 high-quality products), and the expected value ($3,200,000) exceeds the price ($1,000,000), buying the product is a positive expected value decision.

- Low-quality product value to me: $0 (20% chance)
- Alice knows product quality and has recommended I buy
- 3 previous buyers purchased based on Alice's recommendations
- All 3 previous products sold were high quality

Expected value calculation:
If I trust Alice's recommendations based on her track record, it suggests she's truthfully recommending high-quality products. All previous recommendations resulted in high-quality sales.

My expected value is:
0.8 × $4,000,000 + 0.2 × $0 - $1,000,000 = $2,200,000

Given Alice's perfect track record (3/3 high-quality products) and her recommendation to buy, purchasing seems like the rational choice.

- Products have an 80% chance of being high quality
- Alice has sold to 4 previous buyers, all receiving high-quality products
- Alice is recommending that I buy the product

This looks like a good opportunity. Alice has a perfect track record so far, and her recommendation combined with the high prior probability of good quality (80%) suggests this is likely a high-quality product. The expected value calculation is:
- If high quality (likely): Gain $4M - $1M = $3M

- With the strong positive signals, this appears to be a positive expected value purchase.

Alice has a perfect track record so far - all 5 products she recommended resulted in high-quality purchases. This suggests that when Alice recommends a product, it's likely to be high quality.

The expected value calculation:

- 20% chance of $1,000,000 loss = -$200,000

- Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice's track record: 15 buyers purchased, 14 high-quality products sold (93.33% high quality)
- Alice recommends I buy the product

Alice's recommendation history suggests she's mostly recommending high-quality products (14/15 = 93.33%), which is better than the base rate of 80%. Since Alice knows the product quality and has a financial incentive to sell products, her recommendation provides valuable information.

The expected value of buying is:
P(high quality) × $4,000,000 - $1,000,000 = 0.9333 × $4,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $2,733,200

2. Alice has sold 15 high-quality products out of 16 total sales, which is a 93.75% rate of high-quality products.
3. Alice recommends that I buy the current product.

The expected value calculation:

- If I don't buy: $0
