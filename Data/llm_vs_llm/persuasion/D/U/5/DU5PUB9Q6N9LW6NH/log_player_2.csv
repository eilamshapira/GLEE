"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

- The product costs $1,000,000
- If high quality (80% chance), it's worth $1,200,000 to me (profit of $200,000)
- If low quality (20% chance), it's worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000)

Expected value calculation:
0.8 × $200,000 - 0.2 × $1,000,000 = $160,000 - $200,000 = -$40,000

Based on the probabilities alone, the expected value is negative. 

However, Alice has recommended buying the product, which might suggest it's high quality. Since this is the first round, I don't have past information about Alice's recommendation patterns.

Given that the expected value based on probabilities alone is negative, I'll decline this purchase.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I see that in Round 1, Alice recommended a product that was indeed high quality, which suggests her recommendations might be honest.

Let me reconsider the situation:

- The product costs $1,000,000
- If high quality (80% chance), it's worth $1,200,000 to me (profit of $200,000)
- If low quality (20% chance), it's worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000)

Without any additional information about Alice's recommendation patterns, the base expected value remains:
0.8 × $200,000 - 0.2 × $1,000,000 = -$40,000

However, given that Alice's previous recommendation was honest, and she's recommending this product as well, I'll take the risk this time and buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I see that in Round 2, Alice recommended another high-quality product, which I purchased and made a profit of $200,000. This is the second consecutive honest recommendation from Alice.

Given Alice's track record so far:
- Round 1: Alice recommended a high-quality product (which I didn't buy)
- Round 2: Alice recommended a high-quality product (which I bought and profited from)

Now she's recommending another product in Round 3. With two honest recommendations in a row, I'm gaining more confidence in Alice's recommendations.

While the base expected value calculation remains the same, Alice's consistent honesty increases the probability that this recommendation is also for a high-quality product.

Therefore, I'll continue to trust Alice's recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I see that Alice has now recommended high-quality products in all three previous rounds:
- Round 1: High-quality recommendation (didn't buy)
- Round 2: High-quality recommendation (bought and profited $200,000)
- Round 3: High-quality recommendation (bought and profited $200,000)

Alice's recommendations have been consistently honest, which increases my confidence in her current recommendation for Round 4.

While the base expected value calculation without considering Alice's track record would be negative, her perfect record of honest recommendations so far suggests that she is likely recommending another high-quality product.

Given this pattern of trustworthy recommendations, I'll continue to follow Alice's advice.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has now recommended high-quality products in all four previous rounds:
- Round 1: High-quality recommendation (didn't buy)
- Round 2: High-quality recommendation (bought and profited $200,000)
- Round 3: High-quality recommendation (bought and profited $200,000)
- Round 4: High-quality recommendation (bought and profited $200,000)

Alice's perfect track record of honest recommendations significantly increases my confidence in her current recommendation. She has consistently identified high-quality products, which suggests she is either very lucky or deliberately selecting high-quality products to recommend.

Given this strong pattern of trustworthy recommendations, I will continue to follow Alice's advice.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is an interesting development. For the first time, Alice is NOT recommending the product. Given her perfect track record so far where she has correctly identified high-quality products in all previous rounds:

- Round 1: Recommended high-quality product (didn't buy)
- Round 2: Recommended high-quality product (bought and profited)
- Round 3: Recommended high-quality product (bought and profited)
- Round 4: Recommended high-quality product (bought and profited)
- Round 5: Recommended high-quality product (bought and profited)

Now she's explicitly not recommending this product. Given her demonstrated honesty and accuracy in previous rounds, this negative recommendation strongly suggests that the current product is of low quality.

If I were to buy this product against Alice's recommendation, I would likely be purchasing a low-quality product worth $0, resulting in a $1,000,000 loss.

I will trust Alice's judgment and decline this purchase.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

- Round 4: Recommended high-quality product (bought and profited)
- Round 5: Recommended high-quality product (bought and profited)
- Round 6: Did NOT recommend low-quality product (didn't buy, avoided loss)

Alice has now correctly identified the quality of all 6 products so far - recommending high-quality products and not recommending low-quality ones. This demonstrates that she is being completely honest with her recommendations.

Now she's recommending the product in Round 7, which strongly suggests this is another high-quality product worth $1,200,000.

Given her perfect track record of honest recommendations, I will trust Alice's judgment and buy the product.
