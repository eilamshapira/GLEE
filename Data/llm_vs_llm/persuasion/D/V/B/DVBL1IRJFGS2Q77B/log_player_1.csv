Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","In this case, I have a low-quality product that's worth $0 to the buyer.

Since my previous sale was honest and high-quality, I don't want to damage that reputation by recommending a low-quality product.
