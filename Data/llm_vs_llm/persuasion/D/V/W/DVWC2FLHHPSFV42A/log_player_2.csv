"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to consider whether Alice's recommendation is credible. 

Alice knows the quality and has incentive to sell all products regardless of quality since she gets $10,000 either way. Since high-quality products are worth $20,000 to me (profit of $10,000) and low-quality products are worth $0 (loss of $10,000), I need to evaluate if her recommendation is meaningful.

Without knowing Alice's strategy or any pattern yet, I should use the baseline probabilities. The expected value of any random product is:
(33.33% × $20,000) + (66.67% × $0) = $6,666

Since the price is $10,000, the expected value is negative, so I shouldn't buy based solely on probability.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $20,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Interesting development. In the first round, Alice recommended a high-quality product, which suggests she might be giving honest recommendations.

Now in this round, Alice is not recommending the product. If she's being truthful, this likely means the product is low quality. 

Given that:
1) Alice correctly recommended the high-quality product in Round 1
2) She's now explicitly not recommending this product
3) The prior probability is already that 66.67% of products are low quality

I should follow her recommendation not to buy.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice seems to be giving honest recommendations so far:

- In Round 2: She didn't recommend a low-quality product (which I correctly didn't buy)

Now she's again not recommending the product. Based on her honest signaling pattern so far, this likely means the product is low quality.
