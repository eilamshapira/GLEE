"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think this through. 

Alice is not recommending the product. She can see the product's quality, but I only know the general distribution: 33.33% chance of high quality (worth $1,250,000 to me) and 66.67% chance of low quality (worth $0 to me).

If I were to buy randomly with no information, my expected value would be:
0.3333 × $1,250,000 + 0.6667 × $0 = $416,625

Since the price is $1,000,000, buying randomly would give me negative expected value.

Now Alice is specifically not recommending this product. This suggests the product is more likely to be low quality. Since buying randomly already gives negative expected value, and this information makes it even less attractive, I should definitely not buy.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

So far, Alice has consistently not recommended products that were low quality. Now, for the first time, she's recommending that I buy a product.

Given that Alice knows the product quality and is making recommendations, her change in behavior is significant. Since she's recommending this product, it suggests it's more likely to be high quality.

If the product is high quality (which seems likely given Alice's recommendation), it's worth $1,250,000 to me. Since the price is $1,000,000, buying it would give me a profit of $250,000.

Based on Alice's consistent behavior so far and her now positive recommendation, I'll take the risk.
