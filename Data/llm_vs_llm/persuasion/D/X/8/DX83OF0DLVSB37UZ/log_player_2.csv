"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this opportunity. 

Given the fixed price of $10,000 and the product's possible values:
- High quality: worth $40,000 (profit of $30,000)
- Low quality: worth $0 (loss of $10,000)

With a 50% chance of each outcome, the expected value is:
0.5 × $30,000 + 0.5 × (-$10,000) = $15,000 + (-$5,000) = $10,000

This is positive, suggesting it's a good deal in the long run. However, Alice's recommendation provides no additional information since I don't know her incentives (she might always recommend buying).

Since the expected value is positive regardless of Alice's recommendation, I'll buy.
