Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this decision:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Value if high quality: $12,500 (profit of $2,500)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $10,000)
4. Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
5. Alice's recommendation: Buy
6. No prior sales history to evaluate Alice's credibility

Expected value calculation:
* 80% chance of $12,500 = $10,000
* 20% chance of $0 = $0
* Total expected value = $10,000

Since the expected value equals the price, and Alice is recommending the purchase, it's slightly favorable to buy.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (80% chance): $12,500
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

3. Previous sales data:
   - 1 buyer before me
   - 1 high-quality product sold
   - 100% success rate so far

4. Alice's recommendation: Positive

This looks promising because:
- The expected value is positive: (0.8 × $12,500) + (0.2 × $0) = $10,000
- Alice has a perfect track record (1/1 high quality)
- Alice is recommending the purchase
- The natural probability of high quality (80%) is favorable

* 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
* Total expected value = $10,000

2. Track record analysis:
* 2 buyers so far
* 2 high-quality products sold
* 100% success rate with recommendations

3. Factors in favor:
* Alice's recommendation has been reliable (2/2 success)
* The base probability of high quality is good (80%)
* The expected value equals the asking price

Given that Alice's previous recommendations have been accurate and the expected value matches the price, it's a reasonable decision to buy.

The price ($10,000) equals the expected value. However, given Alice's perfect track record and her positive recommendation, the actual probability of high quality is likely higher than the base 80%. This makes the expected value higher than the price.
