Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $1,000,000
2. Value if high quality: $1,200,000 (profit of $200,000)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
4. Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
5. Alice recommends buying

Expected value calculation:
* 80% chance of $200,000 profit = $160,000
* 20% chance of $1,000,000 loss = -$200,000
* Net expected value = -$40,000

Even though Alice recommends buying, the expected value is negative, and there's no track record to validate Alice's trustworthiness yet. The potential loss ($1,000,000) is much larger than the potential gain ($200,000).

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this decision:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Value if high quality (80% chance): $1,200,000
3. Value if low quality (20% chance): $0
4. Expected value = (0.8 × $1,200,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $960,000

While Alice recommends buying the product, I have to consider that:
- The expected value ($960,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000)
- There's no previous sales history to establish trust
- Alice has an incentive to sell regardless of quality

Given that the expected value is less than the price, and there's no track record to build trust, the rational decision is to not buy.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Prior probability of high quality: 80%
2. Value if high quality: $1,200,000
3. Cost: $1,000,000
4. Value if low quality: $0
5. Alice doesn't recommend buying
6. No prior sales history to reference

Given that Alice knows the true value and doesn't recommend buying, this is a strong signal that the product might be low quality. While the base rate of high-quality products is 80%, Alice's negative recommendation significantly reduces the probability that this is a high-quality product.

The risk of losing $1,000,000 on a low-quality product outweighs the potential $200,000 gain on a high-quality product, especially with Alice's negative recommendation.

Since the expected value is less than the price, and there's no track record to establish trust in Alice's recommendations, it would not be rational to buy.

Since Alice knows the true value and doesn't recommend buying, this is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. Given that there's no previous sales history to cross-reference, I should take Alice's recommendation seriously.

The expected value would be negative if the product is likely low quality, and Alice's recommendation suggests exactly that.

Given Alice knows the true values and doesn't recommend buying, this is a strong signal that the product might be low quality. While the base rate of high-quality products is 80%, Alice's negative recommendation significantly updates this probability downward.

If it's low quality (which seems likely given Alice's recommendation), I would lose $1,000,000. If it's high quality, I would only gain $200,000. The risk-reward ratio doesn't look favorable here.
