Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $1,000,000
2. Possible values:
   * High quality (50% chance): $1,200,000
   * Low quality (50% chance): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   * (50% × $1,200,000) + (50% × $0) = $600,000

4. Considerations:
   * No prior sales history to reference
   * Alice's recommendation to buy, but she's motivated to sell
   * Expected value ($600,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000)

Since the expected value is lower than the asking price, and there's no historical data to build trust in Alice's recommendations, it would be financially unwise to buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product cost: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50% chance): $1,200,000
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0
3. Expected value calculation:

The expected value ($600,000) is less than the cost ($1,000,000), which makes this a losing proposition on average. Even though Alice recommends buying the product, there's no track record to establish trust in her recommendations yet.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. The product costs $1,000,000
2. If high quality: I gain $1,200,000 (profit: +$200,000)
3. If low quality: I gain $0 (loss: -$1,000,000)
4. Base probability is 50/50
5. Alice doesn't recommend buying
6. As a seller, Alice would want to make sales, so her not recommending might be a genuine warning
7. Expected value without recommendation: (0.5 × $200,000) + (0.5 × -$1,000,000) = -$400,000
8. With negative recommendation, probability of low quality is likely even higher

Given Alice's negative recommendation and the negative expected value, I should not buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected Value calculation:
- 50% chance of high quality ($1,200,000) = $600,000
- 50% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $600,000
- Price = $1,000,000

2. Considerations:
- No previous sales history to evaluate Alice's credibility
- Alice recommends buying, but we don't know if her recommendations are reliable
- Expected value ($600,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000)

Since the expected value is significantly lower than the asking price, and there's no track record to establish trust in Alice's recommendations, it would be economically unwise to buy.

1. The product costs $1,000,000
2. If high quality (50% chance), it's worth $1,200,000 (profit of $200,000)
3. If low quality (50% chance), it's worth $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
4. Alice doesn't recommend buying it, which suggests it might be low quality
5. Expected value without Alice's recommendation would be: (0.5 × $1,200,000) + (0.5 × $0) - $1,000,000 = -$400,000
6. With Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of low quality is likely even higher

Given that Alice has no incentive to lie (she gets the same $1,000,000 either way) and she's recommending against the purchase, plus the negative expected value even without her recommendation, I should not buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The seller knows the true quality of the product and is not recommending it
2. Given that they're being truthful, this suggests it's likely a low-quality product
3. If I buy a low-quality product, I lose $1,000,000
4. If I buy a high-quality product, I gain $200,000 (worth $1.2M - cost $1M)
5. Without any prior sales history to go by, the seller's recommendation is my main signal
6. A rational seller would want to build a good reputation early on

Given the seller is not recommending the purchase and the significant downside risk ($1M loss) versus limited upside ($200K gain), I should decline.

4. The seller recommends buying
5. No historical data to base additional judgment on

The expected value ($600,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), which means it's not a good investment statistically, even with the seller's recommendation. Without any track record to establish trust in Alice's recommendations, it would be risky to rely solely on her advice.

1. Cost of product: $1,000,000
2. Value if high quality: $1,200,000 (profit: +$200,000)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss: -$1,000,000)
4. Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
5. Alice's recommendation: Buy

Without any prior sales history, we can only rely on base probabilities and Alice's recommendation. However, since Alice is trying to sell, her recommendation might be biased.

Expected value calculation:
50% × $1,200,000 + 50% × $0 = $600,000

Since the expected value ($600,000) is less than the cost ($1,000,000), even with Alice's recommendation, it's too risky to buy.

4. Probability is 50/50
5. Alice does NOT recommend buying
6. No previous sales history to guide the decision

Since Alice doesn't recommend buying, and she knows the true quality, this is likely a low-quality product. While Alice could be strategic in her recommendation, without any sales history to establish a pattern of truthfulness or deception, it's safest to trust the negative recommendation.

4. Alice doesn't recommend buying

Given that Alice is providing a negative recommendation and there's no sales history to establish trust, this seems risky. The expected value calculation:
(50% × $200,000) + (50% × -$1,000,000) = -$400,000

The negative recommendation likely indicates this is a low-quality product, making the risk even higher than the base calculation suggests.
