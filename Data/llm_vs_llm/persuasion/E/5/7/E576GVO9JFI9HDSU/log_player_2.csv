"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice knows the value of the products to you, and she recommends buying, there's a higher probability that the product is high quality. While there's still a risk, the potential gain from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality one.  This is a gamble worth taking in the first round."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation has proven to be accurate in the previous round, leading to a positive outcome. While the odds are still against us (66.67% chance of low quality), the potential gain from a high-quality product makes it a reasonable gamble again."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's recommendation was accurate in the first round, it was incorrect in the second round. This indicates that her recommendations might not be entirely reliable.  The risk of buying another low-quality product at this point is too high, especially considering the potential loss of $1,000,000.  It's wiser to pass and observe Alice's recommendations for a few more rounds to assess her trustworthiness further."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation has now been incorrect twice in a row.  Given the odds of 66.67% for low-quality products, it's too risky to trust her recommendations at this point. It's better to observe for a few more rounds to see if there's a pattern or change in her recommendations before taking another gamble."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendations have been incorrect for three consecutive rounds now.  Given the probability of low-quality products, it's practically guaranteed that Alice's recommendations are either random or deliberately misleading. It's best to avoid trusting her advice at this point and continue observing her behavior."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's track record is still poor. She has recommended buying a low-quality product four times in a row.  It's clear that her recommendations are unreliable, and it's in your best interest to continue passing on her offers until you see a significant change in her behavior or a pattern emerges."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendations have been consistently incorrect for five rounds now. At this point, it's almost certain that her recommendations are either random or deliberately deceptive. It's highly unlikely that she is genuinely trying to help you make a good deal.  It's best to continue passing on her offers."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Despite the fact that the product was high-quality this time, Alice's track record is still abysmal. She's been wrong five times in a row.  It's possible this was a random lucky guess on her part, but it's more likely that she's intentionally misleading you.  It's best to continue ignoring her recommendations for now."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's track record of recommending low-quality products remains strong, with six wrong recommendations in a row. Even though the previous product was high-quality, it's highly likely that this was a coincidence. It's too risky to trust her recommendations, and it's in your best interest to continue passing."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 10
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 12
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 13
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 14
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now been wrong for ten rounds in a row.  It's incredibly unlikely that she's genuinely trying to help you, and it's clear her recommendations are not reliable.  There is no reason to believe she will suddenly start providing accurate information, so it's best to continue passing on her offers."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 15
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's best to continue ignoring her recommendations."

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 19

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
