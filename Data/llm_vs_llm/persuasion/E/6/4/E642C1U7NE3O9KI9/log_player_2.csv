"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendation seems to be advising against buying this product. Since she knows the true quality of the product, and there's only a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $400 (versus a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product worth $0), I should take her recommendation seriously.

If Alice is being truthful and doesn't recommend buying this product, it's likely because it's low quality and worth $0 to me, making the $100 price a bad deal.

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice again doesn't recommend buying the product. Given that her previous recommendation was accurate (the product was indeed low quality), I should continue to trust her advice. Since she knows the true quality and is advising against purchase, it's likely another low-quality product that would be worth $0 to me while costing $100.
