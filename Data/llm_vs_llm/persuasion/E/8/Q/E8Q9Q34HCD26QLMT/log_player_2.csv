Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze the expected value of this purchase.

Given information:
- 80% chance the product is high quality (worth $12,000)
- 20% chance the product is low quality (worth $0)
- Price is $10,000
- Alice does not recommend buying

The fact that Alice doesn't recommend buying is significant information. Since the prior probability of high quality is 80%, Alice's recommendation against buying suggests the product is likely low quality. Without any sales history to evaluate Alice's recommendation patterns, I should take her advice seriously.

Expected value with this negative recommendation is likely below the $10,000 price.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to carefully evaluate this situation. 

Alice recommends buying the product. Since no products have been sold yet, I don't have historical data to judge Alice's credibility. However, I know that:
- 80% of products are high quality (worth $12,000)
- 20% are low quality (worth $0)
- Product price is $10,000

My expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 0.8 × ($12,000 - $10,000) + 0.2 × ($0 - $10,000) = $0.8 × $2,000 - $0.2 × $10,000 = $1,600 - $2,000 = -$400

Even though Alice recommends buying, the expected value appears negative. However, I should also consider that Alice might have revealed information about this specific product's quality, which could change the probabilities from the base rates.

Given the incomplete information and negative expected value based on prior probabilities, I'll decline.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze whether buying the product is a good decision based on the expected value.

Facts:
- Product costs: $10,000
- High-quality product worth: $12,000 (20% profit)
- Low-quality product worth: $0 (100% loss)
- Probability of high quality: 80%
- Probability of low quality: 20%
- Alice recommends buying the product

Expected value of buying = (0.8 × $12,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $9,600

Since the expected value ($9,600) is less than the cost ($10,000), the rational decision is not to buy.

Alice's recommendation could be valuable information, but without an established track record of her recommendations, I can't determine if her advice correlates with product quality.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully:

- The product costs $10,000
- A high-quality product is worth $12,000 to me (profit of $2,000)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- 80% chance of high quality, 20% chance of low quality
- Alice does not recommend buying

Since Alice has access to the true quality information and is not recommending the purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If I were to ignore her recommendation and just go with the prior probabilities, my expected value would be:
0.8 × $12,000 + 0.2 × $0 - $10,000 = $9,600 - $10,000 = -$400

But given Alice's negative recommendation, I should update my belief toward the product being low quality, making the expected value even worse.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully.

In this scenario:
- Price of product: $10,000
- Value of high-quality product: $12,000
- Value of low-quality product: $0
- Probability of high-quality product: 80%
- Probability of low-quality product: 20%
- Alice recommends buying the product

The expected value of the product is:
(0.8 × $12,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $9,600

Since the expected value ($9,600) is less than the price ($10,000), it would be a negative expected value purchase.

However, Alice has recommended buying the product, which might suggest it's high quality. But without knowing Alice's incentives or reliability, I can't weigh this recommendation strongly.

The product has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $12,000) and a 20% chance of being low quality (worth $0).

Expected value = (0.8 × $12,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $9,600

The asking price is $10,000, which is higher than the expected value.

Additionally, Alice does not recommend buying the product. Since Alice knows the true quality, this recommendation suggests this particular product might be low quality.

Based on these factors, I should not buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze whether to buy this product based on the available information.

Alice is recommending I buy the product, but we have no sales history yet to evaluate her trustworthiness. Let me calculate the expected value:

- 80% chance of high quality (worth $12,000)
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)
- Price is $10,000

Expected value = (0.8 × $12,000) + (0.2 × $0) - $10,000 = $9,600 - $10,000 = -$400

Based purely on the prior probabilities and Alice's recommendation (which I can't yet verify through past behavior), the expected value is negative. However, Alice's recommendation might indicate the product is high quality.

Without more information on Alice's recommendation accuracy, I'll have to pass on this purchase.

- The price is fixed at $10,000
- Alice does not recommend that I buy the product
- No products have been sold yet, so I have no prior data on Alice's recommendations

When Alice does NOT recommend buying, this suggests the product might be low quality. Given that Alice revealed the true quality of a randomly selected product and then made her recommendation, her negative recommendation is a strong signal that this particular product is likely low quality.

If I buy a low-quality product, I'd pay $10,000 for something worth $0, resulting in a significant loss.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to consider this decision carefully. 

Alice recommends buying the product, but I need to evaluate if this is a good deal based on expected value.

The product costs $10,000.
- If high quality (80% chance), it's worth $12,000 to me
- If low quality (20% chance), it's worth $0 to me

Expected value = (0.8 × $12,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $9,600

Since the expected value ($9,600) is less than the price ($10,000), this is not a profitable purchase in expectation.

Alice's recommendation could be strategic since there's no sales history yet, but the math indicates this is not a good deal.

I know that:
