Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50%): $30,000
   - Low quality (50%): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (50% × $30,000) + (50% × $0) = $15,000

4. Alice has recommended buying the product.
   - However, since there's no previous sales history, I can't evaluate her recommendation credibility.

Since the expected value ($15,000) is higher than the price ($10,000), and despite the lack of historical data, the positive recommendation from Alice makes this a favorable risk-reward proposition.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Cost of product: $10,000
2. Potential value: $30,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
3. Previous statistics:
   - 1 buyer so far
   - 1 sale made
   - 1 high-quality product sold (100% success rate)
4. Alice recommends buying

This looks favorable because:
1. Alice has a perfect track record so far (1/1 high quality)
2. Alice is recommending the purchase
3. Expected value if probabilities are 50/50: (50% × $30,000) - $10,000 = $5,000 positive expected value
4. The fact that Alice is recommending it, combined with her perfect track record, suggests this might be another high-quality product

3. Track record:
   - 2 buyers so far
   - 2 high-quality products sold
   - 100% success rate
4. Alice is recommending to buy

The track record shows that Alice has been honest so far, with all sold products being high quality. Her recommendation combined with her perfect track record makes this a trustworthy offer. The expected value calculation also works in favor of buying:

Expected value = (50% × $30,000) - $10,000 = $5,000 positive expected return

Given these factors, I'll accept the offer.

2. Current offer:
- Price: $10,000
- Potential value: $30,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Alice recommends buying
- Alice's recommendations have been accurate so far

3. Risk/Reward:
- If high quality: Profit of $20,000
- If low quality: Loss of $10,000
- Alice's perfect track record and recommendation is a strong positive signal

Given Alice's perfect track record and her recommendation to buy, combined with the potential for a $20,000 profit, this appears to be a good opportunity.

4. Previous sales:
   - 4 buyers purchased
   - 3 high-quality products sold
   - 75% success rate so far
5. Alice recommends buying

Given that:
- Alice has a good track record (75% high quality)
- Alice is recommending to buy
- The expected value calculation: (75% × $30,000) + (25% × $0) = $22,500
- $22,500 is greater than the $10,000 price

This looks like a positive expected value situation, so I should buy.

3. Previous sales data:

   - 4 high-quality products sold
   - That's an 80% success rate

4. Alice is recommending to buy

The historical data shows that Alice's recommendations have been reliable (80% high quality), and she's recommending this product. If I buy:
- If high quality: Profit = $30,000 - $10,000 = $20,000
- If low quality: Loss = $0 - $10,000 = -$10,000

Given the high success rate of previous sales and Alice's positive recommendation, this appears to be a good opportunity.

1. Value assessment:
- High quality product value: $30,000
- Low quality product value: $0
- Price: $10,000

2. Historical data:
- 6 previous buyers purchased
- 4 high-quality products were sold
- This means 4/6 (66.67%) of sold products were high quality
- Alice is recommending to buy

3. Decision logic:
- Historical performance shows Alice's recommendations have been fairly reliable
- With 66.67% success rate, expected value = (0.6667 × $30,000) + (0.3333 × $0) = $20,001
- Expected value ($20,001) > Price ($10,000)
- Alice's recommendation adds additional positive signal

Given the positive historical track record and Alice's recommendation, the expected value exceeds the price, making this a profitable decision.

   - Low quality: $0 (50% chance)
3. Sales history:
   - 7 buyers purchased
   - 4 high-quality products sold (57% success rate)
4. Alice recommends buying

Since Alice has recommended buying and has maintained a positive track record (57% high-quality products), this suggests some reliability. With a 57% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $30,000, the expected value would be:
- 57% × $30,000 = $17,100

Since the expected value ($17,100) is higher than the price ($10,000), and Alice's recommendation aligns with her relatively good track record, it's rational to buy.

4. Alice recommends buying

The historical data shows that 50% of sold products were high quality, which matches the base probability. The expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of $30,000 = $15,000
- 50% chance of $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $15,000

Since the expected value ($15,000) is higher than the price ($10,000), and Alice recommends buying, it's rational to purchase.

- Potential value: $30,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Expected value = (55.6% × $30,000) = $16,680

Since the expected value ($16,680) is higher than the cost ($10,000), and Alice's track record shows more high-quality products than low-quality ones, it's a rational decision to buy.

Even though Alice recommends buying, the historical data shows she has recommended products that turned out to be low quality almost as often as high quality (6/11 ≈ 55% success rate).
