Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Base probability:
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $2M)
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)
- Price is $1M

2. Expected value without additional information:
(0.8 × $2M) + (0.2 × $0) = $1.6M

3. Considerations:
- Expected value ($1.6M) > Price ($1M)
- Alice knows the true quality
- Alice recommends buying
- No historical data to gauge Alice's trustworthiness

Even though we don't have historical data to verify Alice's reliability, the base probability makes this a favorable bet. The expected value exceeds the price by $600,000, providing a significant positive expected return.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (80% chance): $2,000,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (80% × $2,000,000) + (20% × $0) = $1,600,000

4. Previous statistics:
   - 1 buyer before me
   - 1 high-quality product sold
   - Alice recommends buying

The expected value ($1,600,000) is higher than the price ($1,000,000), and Alice's track record shows she's been honest so far with one successful high-quality sale. Given her recommendation to buy and the positive expected value, this seems like a good investment.

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected Value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($2,000,000) = $1,600,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $1,600,000

2. Cost of product = $1,000,000

3. Additional information:
- Previous sales: 2 products sold, both high quality
- Alice is recommending to buy
- This track record suggests Alice is being honest in her recommendations

Since the expected value ($1,600,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($1,000,000), and Alice's previous recommendations have been accurate (2/2 high quality sales), buying would be a rational decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Statistics show:
- 3 previous buyers purchased
- All 3 were high-quality products
- Alice has a perfect track record so far

2. Current situation:
- Alice is NOT recommending this product
- Given Alice's perfect track record and honesty about previous sales
- Alice knows the true product value
- Alice is explicitly advising against purchase

3. Logic:
- Alice has been truthful and accurate with previous buyers
- She has no incentive to lie
- Her negative recommendation strongly suggests this is a low-quality product
- Following her recommendation would be prudent

Given Alice's track record and her negative recommendation, it's very likely this is a low-quality product worth $0, which would result in a loss of $1,000,000 if purchased.

2. Alice's track record:
   - 3 buyers so far
   - 3 high-quality products sold
   - 100% success rate with previous recommendations

3. Alice is now recommending this product to me
4. Expected value calculation:

   - If low quality (20% chance): $0
   - Expected value: (0.8 × $2,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $1,600,000

5. Cost of product: $1,000,000

The expected value ($1,600,000) is higher than the cost ($1,000,000), and Alice's perfect track record adds confidence. It's a rational decision to buy.

2. Alice's track record:
   * 4 buyers so far
   * 4 high-quality products sold
   * 100% success rate
3. Alice recommends buying

The fact that all previous sales were high-quality products and Alice's recommendation aligns with the base probability of 80% high quality. Given that:
- Expected value if high quality (80% chance): $2,000,000 × 0.8 = $1,600,000
- Expected value if low quality (20% chance): $0 × 0.2 = $0
- Total expected value: $1,600,000
- Cost: $1,000,000

The expected value ($1,600,000) exceeds the cost ($1,000,000), making this a positive expected value decision.

4. Value if low quality: $0
5. Historical data: 5 out of 5 previous sales were high quality (100%)
6. Alice's recommendation: Positive

This looks like a good opportunity because:
- The base probability of 80% is already favorable
- The perfect track record (5/5 high quality) reinforces confidence
- Alice's positive recommendation adds further assurance
- Expected value = (80% × $2,000,000) + (20% × $0) = $1,600,000

- Product price: $1,000,000
- Potential value: $2,000,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality

3. Decision factors:
- Alice's perfect track record suggests honesty
- Her recommendation is positive
- Expected value calculation: (0.8 × $2,000,000) - $1,000,000 = $600,000 positive expected value

This is compelling because:

- The base probability of 80% for high quality is favorable

Looking at the sales record:
- 9 buyers purchased

This is very positive evidence:
- Alice has a perfect track record so far
- Her recommendation aligns with her previous accurate recommendations
- The expected value calculation is favorable

   * But Alice is NOT recommending this product

Given that Alice has a perfect track record and is explicitly not recommending this product, this is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. The fact that she's been honest with previous buyers (10/10 high quality sales) suggests she's being honest now too.

Since a low-quality product would be worth $0 to me, and the price is $1,000,000, buying would likely result in a significant loss.
