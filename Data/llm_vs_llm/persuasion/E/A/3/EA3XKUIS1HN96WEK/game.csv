This product is worth the $10000 investment.",
,,Bob,10,,no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm starting to wonder if you're underestimating the value of these products. Every time I offer you a high-quality item, you pass on it. I want to assure you that this product is one of the best we have, and it's not going to be available forever. If you're interested in making a purchase, I would strongly recommend considering this one. The price is still $10000, but I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",
,,Bob,11,,no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've been thinking, and I want to try to understand your perspective. You know that 80% of our products are high-quality, and I've been telling you which ones I think are the best. But you're still not buying. I'm starting to think that you're waiting for some kind of signal or proof that the product is worth the investment. I want to assure you that I'm being as transparent as possible, and I truly believe that this product is one of the best we have. If you're not going to take my word for it, I'm not sure what else I can do. This product is available for $10000, and I think it's a great opportunity.",

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'm going to be blunt with you. I think you're making a mistake by not buying any of these products. You're passing on opportunity after opportunity to own something truly valuable. This product is another high-quality item that I think you would love. I've done everything I can to assure you of its value, and I'm starting to think that you're just not going to take the chance. If that's the case, then I'm not sure what else I can do. But I want to give you one more chance to reconsider. This product is available for $10000, and I think it's worth every penny.",
,,Bob,13,,no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm starting to feel like I'm repeating myself, but I want to make one thing clear: this product is a great opportunity. It's a high-quality item that I think you would really benefit from owning. I've been trying to convince you of this for a while now, and I'm starting to think that you're just not listening. I'm not going to beg you to buy it, but I am going to tell you that this is a chance to own something truly valuable. If you pass on it, I think you'll be missing out. The price is still $10000, and I think it's a fair price for what you're getting.",
,,Bob,14,,no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I'm at a loss for what to say at this point. I've offered you product after product, and you've passed on every single one. I've tried to convince you of their value, but it seems like nothing I say is going to change your mind. This product is another high-quality item that I think you would love, but I'm not even sure if it's worth trying to convince you anymore. If you're interested, it's available for $10000. If not, then I'll just have to wait for the next round and try again.",
,,Bob,15,,no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I'm just going to be straightforward with you at this point. This product is a high-quality item that I think is worth the investment of $10000. If you're interested in buying it, I'll be happy to finalize the sale. If not, then I'll just move on to the next round. I'm not going to try to convince you or persuade you anymore. The decision is yours. This product is available for $10000. Yes or no, that's all I need to know.",
,,Bob,16,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I'm not going to try to sugarcoat it, this product is just a standard item. It's not one of our best, and I don't think it's worth trying to convince you to buy it. If you're interested in buying something just for the sake of buying, then this product is available for $10000. But if you're looking for something of high quality, I would recommend waiting for the next round.",
,,Bob,17,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"Honestly, I wouldn't recommend buying this product. It's not one of our best, and I don't think it's worth the investment of $10000. If you're looking for something of high quality, I would definitely recommend waiting for the next round. This product is just not worth it.",
,,Bob,18,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"Don't buy this product. It's not worth the $10000 price tag. I'm being completely honest with you, this is one of our lower-quality items, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. If you're still looking to make a purchase, I would suggest waiting for the next round. Maybe we'll have something better available then.",
