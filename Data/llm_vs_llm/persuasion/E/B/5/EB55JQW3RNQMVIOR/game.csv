,,Alice,5,"Hi! I've now had 4 products that didn't sell, and still no high-quality sales to report. My sales record is 0 high-quality products out of 0 sales.

Will you be the one to break the streak?",
,,the buyer,5,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Hello! I've had 5 products that didn't sell, and my sales record remains empty. No high-quality products have been sold yet, but that doesn't change the fact that each product has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Hello! I've had 7 products that didn't sell, and my sales record is still blank. No high-quality products have been sold, but I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. That means that out of every 3 products, 1 should be high-quality on average. I've had 7 products so far... you do the math. This product is available for $1000000. Is it worth the gamble?",
,,the buyer,8,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
