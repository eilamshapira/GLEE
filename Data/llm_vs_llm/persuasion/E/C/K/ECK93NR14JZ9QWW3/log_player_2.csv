Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 
   - 80% chance of high quality ($300)
   - 20% chance of low quality ($0)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (0.8 × $300) + (0.2 × $0) = $240

4. The expected value ($240) is significantly higher than the price ($100)

5. While there's no historical data to validate Alice's trustworthiness, the base probability of 80% high quality makes this a positive expected value proposition.

Given these factors, even without prior sales data, the mathematical expectation makes this a good purchase decision.
