Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Let me think strategically about this. As a seller, I know:
1. This is the first round and first impression matters
2. The product is genuinely high-quality
3. The buyer knows there's an 80% chance of high-quality products in general
4. Building trust can lead to more successful future sales

In this case, I can confidently recommend the product since it's actually high-quality. This will help establish trust and a good reputation for future rounds.

2. This product is also high-quality
3. The buyer can see my perfect track record
