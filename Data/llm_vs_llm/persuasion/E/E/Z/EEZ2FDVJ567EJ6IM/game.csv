high-quality,200.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I understand that you can't determine the quality of the product beforehand, and that this creates a risk for you.  Consider this: a low-quality product is worth $0 to you, and a high-quality one is worth $200.  Since there's a 50% chance of getting either, the expected value of a product is $100, precisely my asking price.  This is a fair offer.  Let's start building trust – I'm confident that over multiple rounds, the quality will speak for itself.",
,,Bob,1,,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm pleased you purchased the last product, which was indeed high-quality. This demonstrates the potential value.  This new product also has the same 50/50 chance of being high-quality, making the $100 price a fair deal.  I’m committed to offering both high and low-quality items randomly. Purchasing now continues to give you the expected value of $100.",
