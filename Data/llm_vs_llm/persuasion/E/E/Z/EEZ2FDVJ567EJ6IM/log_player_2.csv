"Round 1
Alice's message: I understand that you can't determine the quality of the product beforehand, and that this creates a risk for you.  Consider this: a low-quality product is worth $0 to you, and a high-quality one is worth $200.  Since there's a 50% chance of getting either, the expected value of a product is $100, precisely my asking price.  This is a fair offer.  Let's start building trust – I'm confident that over multiple rounds, the quality will speak for itself.
