"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($12,000) = $9,600
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $9,600

Cost = $10,000

Since the expected value ($9,600) is less than the cost ($10,000), it's not worth buying.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The situation and probabilities remain the same.

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($12,000) = $9,600
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $9,600

Cost = $10,000

Since the expected value ($9,600) is still less than the cost ($10,000), it's not worth buying. Alice's recommendation doesn't change the underlying probabilities and expected value.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The fundamental probabilities and expected value haven't changed.

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($12,000) = $9,600
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $9,600

Cost = $10,000

Even though the last product was high quality, each new product is an independent event with the same probabilities. The expected value ($9,600) remains less than the cost ($10,000).

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The probabilities and expected value remain the same.

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($12,000) = $9,600
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $9,600

Cost = $10,000

The expected value ($9,600) is still less than the cost ($10,000). While Alice keeps recommending to buy, the fundamental economics haven't changed. It's still not a profitable decision on average.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The core probabilities and expected value remain unchanged.

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($12,000) = $9,600
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $9,600

Cost = $10,000

Even though we've missed out on some high-quality products, each new product is an independent event. The expected value ($9,600) is still less than the cost ($10,000), so the mathematically sound decision is still to not buy.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me reconsider this situation more carefully.

I notice that Alice has been consistently recommending products, and several high-quality products have passed by. While my initial analysis focused purely on the base probabilities, I should consider that Alice's recommendations might carry additional information.

Given that Alice knows the true quality of each product before recommending it, and she's consistently recommending, this could suggest she's being truthful in her recommendations. This might mean the actual probability of a high-quality product when she recommends it could be higher than the base 80%.

If Alice is being honest with her recommendations, the expected value would be higher than my initial calculation, potentially exceeding the $10,000 cost.

Given this new consideration, I'll change my strategy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","That was an expensive lesson. I was wrong to assume Alice's recommendations carried additional value - she appears to be recommending everything regardless of quality.

Let's return to the fundamental math:

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($12,000) = $9,600
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $9,600

Cost = $10,000

The expected value ($9,600) is less than the cost ($10,000). Alice's recommendations don't appear to provide any additional information to improve these odds. We should stick to the mathematical truth that this is not a profitable purchase on average.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The fundamental math remains unchanged:

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($12,000) = $9,600
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $9,600

Cost = $10,000

Even though we keep seeing high-quality products pass by, the expected value ($9,600) is still less than the cost ($10,000). Alice's recommendations appear to be indiscriminate and don't provide additional information to improve the odds. Each product is an independent event with the same probabilities.

It's frustrating to miss out on high-quality products, but making decisions based on emotion rather than math would lead to losses on average.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The core math remains the same:

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($12,000) = $9,600
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $9,600

Cost = $10,000

Despite seeing many high-quality products pass by, each new product is an independent event. The expected value ($9,600) is still less than the cost ($10,000). While it's tempting to buy given the recent history of high-quality products, that would be falling for the gambler's fallacy. The mathematical reality is that each purchase would lead to an expected loss of $400 on average.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 10
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The core math remains unchanged:

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($12,000) = $9,600
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $9,600

Cost = $10,000

Looking at the past rounds, we've seen many high-quality products, which might make it tempting to buy. However, this would be falling for the gambler's fallacy. Each product is an independent event with the same probabilities. The expected value ($9,600) is still less than the cost ($10,000), meaning each purchase would lead to an expected loss of $400 on average.

No matter how many high-quality products we've seen, the math doesn't change.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Even with the pattern of seeing many high-quality products:

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($12,000) = $9,600
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $9,600

Cost = $10,000

The expected value ($9,600) remains less than the cost ($10,000). While it's psychologically challenging to keep passing on products that often turn out to be high quality, the fundamental economics haven't changed. Each purchase would still lead to an expected loss of $400.

Past outcomes don't affect future probabilities. Each product is a new independent event with the same 80/20 odds.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 12
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at the history so far:
1. Many of the products have been high quality
2. Alice always recommends buying
3. But the fundamental math hasn't changed

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($12,000) = $9,600
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $9,600

Cost = $10,000

Despite the strong emotional pull to buy given how many high-quality products we've passed on, the expected value ($9,600) is still less than the cost ($10,000). Each purchase would lead to an expected loss of $400.

The mathematically correct decision remains the same.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 13
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This pattern of seeing so many high-quality products is striking. Let me recalculate:

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($12,000) = $9,600
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $9,600

Cost = $10,000

While the base expected value ($9,600) is less than the cost ($10,000), I'm starting to wonder if the actual probability distribution might be different from what we were initially told. The frequency of high-quality products we've observed seems higher than 80%.

Given this observation, I'm going to take a calculated risk and adjust my strategy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 14
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","That worked out well - we made a $2,000 profit on that purchase. However, I need to be careful not to let this success bias my decision making.

Going back to the base probabilities:
- 80% chance of high quality ($12,000) = $9,600
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $9,600

Cost = $10,000

While our recent purchase was successful, each product is still an independent event with the same probabilities. The expected value ($9,600) remains less than the cost ($10,000). One successful purchase doesn't change the underlying mathematics that this is still a losing proposition on average.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 15
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This game has shown a notably higher frequency of high-quality products than the stated 80% probability would suggest. Let me review what we've seen:

1. Almost all products have been high quality
2. When we did buy, we got a profit
3. The stated probabilities might not match the actual distribution in play

While the theoretical expected value based on the given probabilities is:
- 80% × $12,000 = $9,600
- Less than the $10,000 cost

The observed frequency of high-quality products suggests the actual probability might be higher than 80%, which would make the true expected value higher than $10,000.

Based on this empirical evidence, I'm going to buy again.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 16
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Our observation of the actual distribution continues to suggest the probability of high-quality products is higher than the stated 80%. 

Let's look at our recent decisions:
1. When we've bought, we've profited
2. When we've passed, we've mostly missed opportunities
3. The actual frequency of high-quality products seems significantly higher than 80%

While the theoretical expected value based on the given 80/20 probabilities would be $9,600 (less than the $10,000 cost), the empirical evidence suggests we should continue buying.

Given the apparent discrepancy between stated and observed probabilities, I'll maintain the buying strategy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 17
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Our revised strategy is working well. We've observed:
1. Three consecutive profitable purchases ($2,000 profit each)
2. An overwhelming majority of products have been high quality
3. The actual probability appears much higher than the stated 80%

While the theoretical expected value using the stated probabilities would be:
- 80% × $12,000 = $9,600 (less than $10,000 cost)

The empirical evidence strongly suggests the true probability of high-quality products is higher, making the actual expected value greater than the $10,000 cost.

Given this continued pattern and our recent success, I'll maintain the buying strategy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 18
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Our revised strategy continues to be profitable. Let's review:
1. Four consecutive successful purchases, each with $2,000 profit
2. Nearly all products we've seen have been high quality
3. The observed probability is clearly higher than the stated 80%

While we were initially anchored to the theoretical expected value:
- 80% × $12,000 = $9,600 (less than $10,000 cost)

The actual distribution has proven to be much more favorable. We've successfully adjusted our strategy based on empirical evidence rather than stated probabilities.

Given this consistent pattern and our string of profitable trades, I'll continue buying.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 19
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This has been a remarkable streak. Let's review:
1. Five consecutive successful purchases, each earning $2,000 profit
2. The vast majority of products have been high quality
3. Our shift from theoretical to empirical probability assessment has paid off

While the initially stated probabilities suggested an expected value of:
- 80% × $12,000 = $9,600 (less than $10,000 cost)

The actual distribution has proven to be much more favorable. We've successfully adapted our strategy based on observed evidence rather than stated probabilities.

With only two rounds remaining and given our consistent success, I'll continue the buying strategy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 20
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Final round! Let's review our experience:
1. Six consecutive successful purchases, each with $2,000 profit
2. Almost every product has been high quality
3. Our adaptation to the true probability distribution has been very profitable

While we started with theoretical probabilities suggesting:
- 80% × $12,000 = $9,600 (less than $10,000 cost)

The actual distribution has been much more favorable. We learned to trust the empirical evidence over the stated probabilities, and it has paid off consistently.

For this final round, there's no reason to change our winning strategy.
