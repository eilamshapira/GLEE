"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","If Alice doesn't recommend the product, she's giving me information that is likely relevant. Given that:
- The price is fixed at $100
- High quality products are worth $200 to me (profit of $100)
- Low quality products are worth $0 to me (loss of $100)
- Alice knows the true quality

If Alice doesn't recommend buying, she's likely indicating it's a low quality product. If I buy it, I would likely lose $100, and if I pass, I lose nothing.
