Alice's message: Welcome! This is my first product for sale. I assure you that all my products have a 50% chance of being high-quality. Unfortunately, I don't have any sales history yet, but I'm confident you'll be satisfied with your purchase. The price is $100. Would you like to buy it?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50% chance): $400
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0
3. Expected value calculation:
   (50% × $400) + (50% × $0) = $200

Since the expected value ($200) is higher than the price ($100), and the risk is reasonable given that:
- The probability is fair (50-50)
- The potential gain ($300 = $400 - $100) is larger than the potential loss ($100)

1. Previous sales record:
- 1 product sold, and it was low-quality
- Alice claims 2 unsold products were high-quality
- Total of 3 previous products, 2 allegedly high-quality

2. Current product:
- Base probability is 50% high-quality/50% low-quality
- Cost: $100
- Potential value: $400 (high) or $0 (low)
- Expected value = (0.5 × $400) + (0.5 × $0) = $200

3. Concerns:
- Alice's credibility is questionable as she's trying to sell
- The only verified sale was a low-quality product
- Claims about unsold products can't be verified

While the expected value ($200) is higher than the cost ($100), Alice's track record of selling a low-quality product and making unverifiable claims about unsold products raises red flags.

1. Price = $100
2. If high quality (50% chance): Value = $400 (profit of $300)
3. If low quality (50% chance): Value = $0 (loss of $100)

Alice's track record:
- 1 product sold: low quality
- 5 unsold products (2 high, 3 low)
- The messaging seems sales-focused and doesn't provide specific information about the current product's quality

Expected value calculation:
0.5 × $400 + 0.5 × $0 = $200

While the expected value ($200) is higher than the price ($100), Alice's track record shows a pattern of selling low-quality products, and her message is vague about the current product's quality. Given the uncertainty and the negative sales history, it would be safer to pass.

3. Concerning factors:
- The only sold product was low-quality
- Alice reveals she had high-quality products that weren't sold
- The sales pattern suggests possible trust issues

4. Decision logic:
Even though Alice's track record isn't great, the fundamental math remains favorable:
- Expected value ($200) is higher than the cost ($100)
- Each product is independent with a 50% chance
- Previous outcomes don't affect the current product's quality

3. Assessment:
- The expected value ($200) is higher than the cost ($100)

3. Red flags:
- Recent sales trend is poor (2 out of 3 sold products were low-quality)

- Her transparency about poor performance is noteworthy

4. Positive signs:
- Overall product distribution (4/9 high-quality) is close to claimed 50%
