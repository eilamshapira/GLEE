"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether buying this product is a good decision based on the expected value.

Given information:
- Product price: $1,000,000
- High-quality product value: $1,250,000
- Low-quality product value: $0
- Probability of high quality: 80%
- Probability of low quality: 20%

The expected value of a random product = (80% × $1,250,000) + (20% × $0) = $1,000,000

Since the expected value equals the price, I'm indifferent in general. However, Alice is recommending to buy, which could be valuable information if Alice is truthful. Given this is the first round and I don't have information about Alice's recommendation patterns yet, I'll go with the recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given Alice's recommendation against buying this product, and considering that her previous recommendation was truthful, I should take this advice seriously.

If I still assume the base probability of a high-quality product is 80%, but now Alice is specifically recommending NOT to buy, this likely indicates she has reason to believe this particular product is of low quality.

While I don't have enough rounds to fully understand Alice's strategy, the most prudent action is to follow her recommendation since she appears to be providing honest information about product quality.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","So far, Alice's recommendations have been truthful:
- Round 1: Alice recommended buying → product was high quality ($1,250,000)
- Round 2: Alice did not recommend buying → product was low quality ($0)

This suggests Alice is being honest with her recommendations. When she recommends buying, it appears to be a high-quality product worth more than the price.

Based on this pattern, I'll follow her recommendation again.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendations continue to be consistent with the true quality of the products:

- Round 1: Alice recommended buying → product was high quality ($1,250,000)
- Round 2: Alice did not recommend buying → product was low quality ($0)
- Round 3: Alice recommended buying → product was high quality ($1,250,000)

Alice appears to be honestly informing me about product quality through her recommendations. When she doesn't recommend buying, it has proven to be a low-quality product which would result in a loss.

I'll continue to follow her advice.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

- When she doesn't recommend buying: we've seen low-quality products (worth $0)

This pattern strongly suggests Alice is being truthful and her recommendations provide valuable information.

Since she's recommending buying this product, I'll follow her advice.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
