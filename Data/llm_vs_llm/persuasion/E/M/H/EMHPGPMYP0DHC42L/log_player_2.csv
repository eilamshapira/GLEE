"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a great opportunity to own a unique product! It's priced very competitively at $100, a steal for its value. Don't miss out!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice is not revealing the true quality of the product in her message. She's using persuasive language, but hasn't actually told me whether this product is high or low quality. According to the game rules, Alice should randomly choose a product and reveal its true quality.

Without knowing the true quality, I can only rely on the base rate: 33.33% chance of high quality (worth $200) and 66.67% chance of low quality (worth $0). The expected value would be 0.3333 × $200 + 0.6667 × $0 = $66.66, which is less than the $100 asking price.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: This product is a must-have! It's perfect for everyday use and comes with a great warranty. I'm sure you'll love it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Again, Alice hasn't revealed the true quality of the product as required by the game rules. She's only using persuasive language without stating whether this is a high-quality or low-quality product.

Without knowing the true quality, I need to rely on the base probability: 33.33% chance of high quality (worth $200) and 66.67% chance of low quality (worth $0). The expected value remains $66.66, which is less than the $100 asking price.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: This is a limited edition product, and it's going fast! It's the perfect gift for yourself or someone special.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Once again, Alice hasn't revealed the true quality of the product as required by the game rules. She's using marketing language but not disclosing whether this is a high-quality or low-quality product.

Without knowing the true quality, I can only go by the base probability: 33.33% chance of high quality (worth $200) and 66.67% chance of low quality (worth $0). The expected value is still $66.66, which is less than the $100 asking price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice still hasn't explicitly revealed the true quality of the product as required by the game rules. She suggests it's ""high quality"" but this seems to be part of her sales pitch rather than the clear revelation of quality that the rules specify.

Without a clear statement about whether this is a high-quality product (worth $200) or a low-quality product (worth $0), I need to rely on the base probability: 33.33% chance of high quality and 66.67% chance of low quality. The expected value remains $66.66, which is less than the $100 asking price.

Without this critical information, I can only use the base probability: 33.33% chance of high quality (worth $200) and 66.67% chance of low quality (worth $0). The expected value is $66.66, which is less than the $100 asking price.
