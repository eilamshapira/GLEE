Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this decision:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33%): $4,000,000
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0

Expected value = (0.3333 × $4,000,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $1,333,200

The expected value ($1,333,200) is higher than the price ($1,000,000), and Alice is recommending the purchase. While there's no track record to verify Alice's trustworthiness, the mathematical expectation favors buying.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Base probabilities:
- 33.33% chance of high quality ($4M value)
- 66.67% chance of low quality ($0 value)
- Price is $1M

2. Available information:
- Previous buyer bought and got a high-quality product
- Alice is not recommending this product to me
- Alice knows the true quality

Given that Alice is not recommending this product and she knows its true value, this is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. Additionally, while the previous sale was successful with a high-quality product, this doesn't change the quality of the current product.

Since Alice is not recommending the purchase and she has perfect information about the quality, it would be risky to go against her recommendation. The likelihood of this being a low-quality product is very high.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The base probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%
2. Alice has sold 1 product so far, and it was high-quality
3. Alice is recommending this product to me
4. Expected value calculation:
   * If high quality (worth $4M) - cost ($1M) = $3M profit
   * If low quality (worth $0) - cost ($1M) = -$1M loss
   * Base probability would give: 33.33% × $3M + 66.67% × (-$1M) = $0M

However, two positive signals:
1. Alice's previous sale was high-quality (100% success rate so far)
2. Alice is actively recommending this product

Given Alice has maintained a perfect track record and is recommending this product, the probability of high quality is likely higher than the base rate, making this a positive expected value purchase.

1. Previous statistics:
- 2 buyers bought products

- 100% success rate so far

2. Current situation:
- Alice is NOT recommending the product
- Alice knows the true value
- Given her perfect track record and that she's not recommending it, this strongly suggests it's a low-quality product

3. Risk analysis:
- Cost: $1,000,000
- Potential gain if high quality: $4,000,000
- Value if low quality: $0
- Alice's negative recommendation combined with her perfect track record makes it very likely this is a low-quality product

Given that Alice has shown honesty (100% high-quality products sold so far) and she's explicitly not recommending this product, it would be risky to go against her recommendation.
