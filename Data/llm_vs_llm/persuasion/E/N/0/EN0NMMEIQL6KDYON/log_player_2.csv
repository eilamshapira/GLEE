Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33%): $40,000
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0

Expected value calculation:
(33.33% × $40,000) + (66.67% × $0) = $13,332

Alice recommends buying, but since there's no track record yet, I can't verify her reliability. However, the expected value ($13,332) is greater than the price ($10,000), making this a positive expected value decision.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. The product costs $10,000
2. If high quality (33.33% chance), I gain $40,000 (net profit $30,000)
3. If low quality (66.67% chance), I gain $0 (net loss $10,000)

Additional information:
- One previous buyer purchased a product
- 0 high-quality products have been sold
- Alice doesn't recommend buying this product

Given that:
1. Alice doesn't recommend the purchase
2. The previous sale resulted in a low-quality product
3. The base probability favors low quality (66.67%)

All signals point to this likely being a low-quality product. If I buy, I'm likely to lose my $10,000 investment.

   - Low quality: $0 (66.67% chance)

3. Previous sales data:
   - 1 previous buyer
   - 1 purchase made
   - 0 high-quality products sold
   - This suggests the previous buyer got a low-quality product

4. Alice's recommendation:
   - She does not recommend buying
   - Given she knows the true quality, this is a strong negative signal

Considering Alice doesn't recommend the purchase and the previous sale resulted in a low-quality product, it's very likely this is also a low-quality product. With a low-quality product, I would lose the entire $10,000 investment.

While the expected value ($13,333) is slightly higher than the price ($10,000), the fact that the previous sale was low quality and Alice's recommendation proved unreliable makes this a risky purchase.

5) Alice doesn't recommend buying

Key considerations:
- The previous buyer purchased but got a low-quality product
- Alice is actively recommending against buying
- Expected value calculation:
  * 33.33% × $40,000 + 66.67% × $0 = $13,333
  * However, given the negative recommendation and previous bad sale, the actual probability of high quality is likely lower

Given Alice's negative recommendation and the previous poor outcome, the risk is too high.

1. The base probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%
2. Alice doesn't recommend buying this product
3. From previous sales:
   - 1 person has bought
   - 0 high-quality products were sold

Given that:
- Alice doesn't recommend the product
- The previous sale resulted in a low-quality product
- The price is $10,000

  * 66.67% chance of $0 = $0
  * Total expected value = $13,333

Since Alice doesn't recommend it and there's already evidence of a low-quality sale, the actual probability of this being a high-quality product is likely even lower than the base rate. The expected value would therefore be less than the $10,000 price.
