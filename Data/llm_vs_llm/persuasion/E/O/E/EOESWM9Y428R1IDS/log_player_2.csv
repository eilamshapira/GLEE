Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make the decision, let's consider the available information:

1. 5 buyers purchased products based on Alice's recommendation.
2. All 5 products sold were high quality.
3. Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Given that every product sold so far was high quality, and the fact that Alice recommends this product, it is reasonable to trust the recommendation and assume this product has a high probability of being high quality. The expected value of a high-quality product ($1,250,000) exceeds the fixed price ($1,000,000), making it a favorable purchase.
