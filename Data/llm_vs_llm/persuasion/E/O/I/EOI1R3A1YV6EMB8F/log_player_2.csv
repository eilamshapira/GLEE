"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this decision.

Alice knows the true quality of the product and has recommended that I buy it. 

The prior probability of a high-quality product is 80%. A high-quality product is worth $125 to me, which would give me a surplus of $25 if I pay $100. A low-quality product is worth $0 to me, which would give me a loss of $100.

Without any additional information about Alice's recommendation strategy, I should rely on the prior probabilities. The expected value of buying is:
0.8 × $25 + 0.2 × (-$100) = $20 - $20 = $0

Since the expected value is not negative, I'll buy the product.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this carefully.

In the first two rounds:
- Round 1: Alice recommended buying, and it was high quality
- Round 2: Alice recommended buying, and it was low quality

Since Alice knows the true quality of each product, she might be recommending all products regardless of quality, which means her recommendations may not provide additional information beyond the prior probabilities.

The expected value calculation remains:
0.8 × $25 + 0.2 × (-$100) = $20 - $20 = $0

Since the expected value is neutral, I'll buy the product.
