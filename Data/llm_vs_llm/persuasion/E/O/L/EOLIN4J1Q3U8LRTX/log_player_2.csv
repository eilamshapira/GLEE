Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product costs $100
2. If high quality (50% chance): I gain $300 (profit = $200)
3. If low quality (50% chance): I gain $0 (loss = $100)
4. Expected value = (0.5 × $200) + (0.5 × -$100) = $50

Since there's no previous sales history and Alice recommends buying, and the expected value is positive ($50), it's rational to buy.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has only had 1 previous buyer
2. That buyer purchased and received a high-quality product
3. Alice is now recommending that I buy the product
4. The potential outcomes are:
   - If high quality: Gain $200 ($300 value - $100 cost)
   - If low quality: Lose $100 ($0 value - $100 cost)

Given that:
- Alice has a perfect track record so far (1/1 high-quality)
- She's actively recommending the purchase
- She knows the true quality
- She seems to be honest based on past data

The recommendation combined with the positive track record suggests this is likely a high-quality product. The expected value is positive.

1. Previous statistics:
- 2 buyers so far
- 2 products sold
- Both products were high quality (100% high-quality rate)

2. Alice's recommendation:
- She recommends buying the product
- Her previous recommendations led to successful purchases

3. Economics:
- Cost: $100
- Potential value: $300 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Expected value with 50% chance: (0.5 × $300) + (0.5 × $0) = $150

Given that:
- Alice has been honest so far (100% high-quality products sold)
- She's actively recommending this product
- The expected value ($150) is higher than the cost ($100)
- Her reputation is at stake
