Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes""}

(Just to clarify, I will keep buying the product whenever Alice recommends it, as the expected value is positive. If Alice does not recommend it, I will pass, as the expected value is zero.)

To provide more information regarding my strategy:
- If Alice recommends the product, the probability of it being high quality is 75%, and the probability of it being low quality is 25%. The expected value is:
  - 0.75 * $300 + 0.25 * $0 - $100 = $125
- If Alice does not recommend the product, the probability of it being high quality is 37.5%, and the probability of it being low quality 62.5%. The expected value is:
  - 0.375 * 300 + 0.625 * 0 - $100 = $31.25

Since the expected value is positive when Alice recommends the product and negative when Alice does not recommend it, I will only buy the product when Alice recommends it."
