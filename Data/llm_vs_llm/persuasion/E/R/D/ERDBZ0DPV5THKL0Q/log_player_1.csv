Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","Before making a decision, let's consider the situation from Bob's perspective. Bob knows that the probability of getting a high-quality product is 80%. However, Bob has already bought three high-quality products in a row. The probability of this happening is 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.512 or 51.2%.

Given that Bob has already experienced a relatively unlikely event (three high-quality products in a row), he might be becoming more cautious. If Bob becomes more risk-averse, he might decide to stop buying, even if the expected value of buying (0.8 * $20,000 - $10,000 = $6,000) is still positive.

To keep Bob buying, we need to reassure him that the products are still high-quality. However, since we can't change the price or offer refunds, and we can't prove to Bob that this product is high-quality, we're limited in what we can do.

In this situation, it might be best to continue recommending Bob to buy the product, as the expected value is still positive for him. However, be prepared for the possibility that Bob might choose not to buy due to increased risk aversion.
