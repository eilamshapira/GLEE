Alice's message: Exciting opportunity! I'm offering a premium product priced at $1000000. With an impressive 80% chance of being high-quality, you could be acquiring a product worth $2000000. Don't miss out on this chance to invest in something truly valuable!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Expected value calculation:
* 80% chance of high quality ($2,000,000) = $1,600,000
* 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
* Total expected value = $1,600,000

2. Cost of product = $1,000,000

3. Expected profit = Expected value - Cost
= $1,600,000 - $1,000,000 = $600,000

Since the expected profit is positive ($600,000), and the probability of high quality (80%) is significantly higher than low quality (20%), this is a mathematically sound investment.

Alice's message: Great news! I'm presenting another premium product for $1000000. There's an 80% probability this product is high-quality, which means it has the potential to be worth $2000000 to you. Take advantage of this incredible opportunity to secure a valuable asset!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - 80% chance of high quality (worth $2,000,000)
   - 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (0.8 × $2,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $1,600,000

4. Previous sales record:
   - 1 buyer so far
   - 1 high-quality product sold
   - 100% success rate so far

The expected value ($1,600,000) is significantly higher than the asking price ($1,000,000), and the previous sale was successful. This suggests a positive expected return, and Alice's track record so far is good.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Prior statistics:
- 2 buyers purchased products
- 2 high-quality products were sold
- 100% success rate so far

2. Product economics:
- Cost: $1,000,000
- Value if high quality: $2,000,000 (80% chance)
- Value if low quality: $0 (20% chance)
- Expected value: (0.8 × $2,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $1,600,000

3. Decision factors:
- The expected value ($1,600,000) is higher than the cost ($1,000,000)
- Perfect track record so far
- The seller's enthusiasm matches with the statistical evidence

Since the expected value exceeds the cost by $600,000 and the previous sales record shows only high-quality products, this appears to be a positive expected value decision.

- 100% success rate so far
- 80% base probability of high quality

2. Alice's message:

- Somewhat cautious language

3. Financial calculation:
- Cost: $1,000,000
- Expected value: (80% × $2,000,000) + (20% × $0) = $1,600,000

1. Historical data:
- 8 previous buyers, 7 high-quality products sold

2. Alice's message:
- She hints that this particular item ""may not be of the highest quality""
- This seems like a direct warning about the current product's quality
- She's trying to deflect attention to the historical success rate

- If low quality: lose $1,000,000 ($0 - $1,000,000)
