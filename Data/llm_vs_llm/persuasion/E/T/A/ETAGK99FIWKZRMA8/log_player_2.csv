Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected Value calculation:
* High quality (80% chance): 0.80 × $3,000,000 = $2,400,000
* Low quality (20% chance): 0.20 × $0 = $0
* Total expected value = $2,400,000

2. Cost of product: $1,000,000

3. Expected profit = Expected Value - Cost
= $2,400,000 - $1,000,000 = $1,400,000

4. Additional considerations:
* Alice is recommending to buy
* This would be the first sale
* Expected value is significantly higher than the cost

Since the expected value ($2,400,000) is more than twice the cost ($1,000,000), and Alice is recommending the purchase, it's a rational decision to buy.

1. Product price: $1,000,000
2. Expected value calculation:
   * High quality (80%): $3,000,000 × 0.80 = $2,400,000
   * Low quality (20%): $0 × 0.20 = $0
   * Total expected value: $2,400,000

3. Previous statistics:
   * 1 buyer before me
   * 1 high-quality product sold
   * 100% success rate so far

4. Alice's recommendation is positive

The expected value ($2,400,000) is significantly higher than the price ($1,000,000), and Alice's track record shows only successful sales. Combined with her positive recommendation, this appears to be a good investment.

4. Value if low quality: $0
5. Alice's track record: 2 out of 2 sales were high quality (100%)
6. Alice is recommending to buy

The expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of $3,000,000 = $2,400,000
- 20% chance of $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $2,400,000

Since Alice has a perfect track record so far and is recommending to buy, combined with the high base probability of good quality (80%), this seems like a good deal. The expected value ($2,400,000) is significantly higher than the price ($1,000,000).

4. Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality

Previous sales data:
- 3 buyers purchased
- All 3 were high quality (100% success rate)
- Alice recommends buying

Given that:
- Alice has a perfect track record so far (3/3 high quality)
- Alice is recommending to buy
