"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential values:
   - High quality (80% chance): $30,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value = (0.8 × $30,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $24,000

Since the expected value ($24,000) is higher than the price ($10,000), it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think this through again:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential values:
   - High quality (80% chance): $30,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Despite losing in the first round, the probabilities haven't changed. Each round is independent, and the fundamental probabilities remain the same.

Expected value = (0.8 × $30,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $24,000

Since the expected value ($24,000) is still higher than the price ($10,000), it's still mathematically rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.
