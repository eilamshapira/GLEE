"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Product price: $1,000,000
2. Worth if high quality: $1,250,000 (80% chance)
3. Worth if low quality: $0 (20% chance)

Expected value calculation:
* 80% × $1,250,000 + 20% × $0 = $1,000,000

The expected value equals the price, but since Alice is recommending the purchase, this might be a positive signal.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the previous round:

1. Alice recommended the product, and it turned out to be high quality
2. This suggests Alice might be giving honest recommendations
3. The base expected value calculation remains the same:
   * 80% × $1,250,000 + 20% × $0 = $1,000,000
4. But with Alice's recommendation and her previous honest recommendation, this increases the likelihood of it being high quality

Given Alice's track record of honest recommendations so far and the fact that the base expected value equals the price, I'll continue to trust her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze:

1. Alice has recommended products twice so far, and both times they were high quality
2. This suggests Alice is being truthful in her recommendations
3. Base expected value remains $1,000,000 (80% × $1,250,000 + 20% × $0)
4. Alice's consistent track record of honest recommendations increases confidence
5. With her recommendation, the probability of high quality likely exceeds 80%, making expected value > $1,000,000

Given Alice's perfect track record so far and her continued recommendation, it makes sense to continue trusting her.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze:

1. Alice has now recommended products three times, and all three were high quality
2. Her track record shows consistent honesty in recommendations
3. Base expected value is $1,000,000 (80% × $1,250,000 + 20% × $0)
4. With three consecutive honest recommendations, we can reasonably infer that when Alice recommends a product, it's more likely to be high quality than the base 80% probability
5. This means the expected value when Alice recommends is likely higher than $1,000,000

Given Alice's perfect track record and continued recommendation, it's rational to continue trusting her judgment.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is a significant development:

1. Alice's track record is now 3 high-quality and 1 low-quality recommendation
2. This reveals that Alice's recommendations are not perfectly reliable
3. Base expected value is still $1,000,000 (80% × $1,250,000 + 20% × $0)
4. The previous loss of $1,000,000 suggests Alice might recommend products regardless of quality
5. Her recommendations may not actually increase the probability above the base 80%
6. Without additional value from Alice's recommendation, the expected value equals the price, making me indifferent

Given this new evidence that Alice's recommendations aren't consistently reliable, and that the expected value merely equals the price, I'll err on the side of caution.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's reassess:

1. Alice's track record is now:
   - 3 true high-quality recommendations
   - 1 false recommendation (low quality)
   - 1 true high-quality recommendation that I missed by not buying
2. This suggests Alice's recommendations are still better than random chance
3. Even with one bad recommendation, her success rate (4/5 = 80%) matches the base probability
4. Base expected value remains $1,000,000 (80% × $1,250,000 + 20% × $0)
5. By not buying last round, I missed a profitable opportunity

Given that:
- Alice's recommendation accuracy matches or exceeds the base probability
- I missed a profitable opportunity by being too cautious
- The expected value at least equals the purchase price

I should return to accepting her recommendations.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze:

1. Alice's current track record:
   - 4 true high-quality recommendations
   - 1 false recommendation (low quality)
   - Her accuracy rate is now 4/5 = 80% for recommendations I acted on
   - Plus 1 true high-quality recommendation I missed
2. Overall, 5 out of 6 of her recommendations (83.3%) have been for high-quality products
3. This is slightly better than the base 80% probability
4. Base expected value is $1,000,000 (80% × $1,250,000 + 20% × $0)
5. With Alice's recommendation track record being slightly better than base rate, expected value is slightly above $1,000,000

Given that Alice's recommendations continue to be reliable at a rate at least as good as the base probability, and my last purchase was successful, I should continue to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!

1. Alice's updated track record:
   - 5 true high-quality recommendations

   - Her accuracy rate is now 5/6 ≈ 83.3% for recommendations I acted on
   - Overall 6/7 ≈ 85.7% of her recommendations were for high-quality products
2. This is better than the base 80% probability
3. Base expected value is $1,000,000 (80% × $1,250,000 + 20% × $0)
4. With Alice's recommendation track record being better than base rate, expected value is above $1,000,000
5. Last two purchases have been successful

Given that:
- Alice's recommendations continue to be more accurate than the base probability
- Recent purchases have been profitable
- Expected value exceeds the purchase price

{""decision"": ""yes""}"

   - Overall 7/8 = 87.5% of her recommendations were for high-quality products
2. This is notably better than the base 80% probability
3. Base expected value is $1,000,000 (80% × $1,250,000 + 20% × $0)
4. With Alice's track record showing 87.5% accuracy, expected value is:
   87.5% × $1,250,000 + 12.5% × $0 = $1,093,750
5. Last three purchases have been successful

2. This is now slightly BELOW the base 80% probability
3. Base expected value remains $1,000,000 (80% × $1,250,000 + 20% × $0)
4. The second low-quality recommendation suggests Alice might be becoming less reliable
5. Just lost $1,000,000 on previous purchase
6. Pattern might suggest Alice is more likely to give bad recommendations after several good ones

Given:
- Accuracy has dropped below base rate
- Just experienced a significant loss
