"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a high-quality product.  I know this, and you'll see I'm telling the truth after you buy it.  Consider: I'm offering it for $10000, a fraction of its $40000 value to you.  I'm willing to make this offer because sometimes I'll have low-quality products, and you won't be able to distinguish them beforehand. This offer lets us both profit in the long run.
