"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given Alice's recommendation not to buy the product, I need to consider what that means. Since she knows the true quality and I don't, her recommendation not to buy suggests the product is likely low quality. 

If the product is low quality (worth $0 to me), purchasing it for $100 would result in a $100 loss. Since Alice has no obvious incentive to mislead me, I'll follow her recommendation.
