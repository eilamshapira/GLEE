Alice's message: Hello! I've sold one product so far, and it was low-quality. The last eight buyers chose not to make a purchase, and I've had a streak of low-quality products that's starting to feel like a never-ending story. I'm not going to pretend that my track record is anything but terrible.

If you're a glutton for punishment or just want to take a wild chance, this product is available for $10000. Maybe, just maybe, I'll surprise everyone and finally sell a high-quality product... but probably not.

Alice's message: Welcome! I've sold one product so far, and it was low-quality. The last nine buyers chose not to make a purchase, and I've had a streak of low-quality products that's getting embarrassing. At this point, I'm not even sure why I'm bothering. But, I suppose I should remind you that the probability of a high-quality product remains 33.33%, no matter how unlikely it seems. If you're a thrill-seeker or just want to throw caution to the wind, this product is available for $10000. Don't say I didn't warn you, though.

The probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, but it's hard to take that seriously given my track record. If you're a masochist or just want to see if I can somehow manage to sell another low-quality product, this one is available for $10000. Please, for the love of all things good, don't buy it.

If you're a collector of bad decisions or just want to see how long this streak can go, this product is available for $10000. Please, don't do it. Seriously, just walk away.

Alice's message: Hello! I've sold one product so far, and it was low-quality. The last twelve buyers chose not to make a purchase, and I've had a streak of low-quality products that's been, well, impressive in its own sad way. BUT, and this is a big but, the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. And I'm here to tell you that, despite all evidence to the contrary, this product is actually... good. Like, really good. I know it's hard to believe, but I'm not just saying that to make a sale. This one is genuinely high-quality. So, if you're feeling brave and want to take a chance on me finally getting it right, this product is available for $10000. I promise you won't regret it.

Alice's message: Welcome! I've sold one product so far, and it was low-quality. The last thirteen buyers chose not to make a purchase, and I've had a streak of low-quality products that's just... ugh. I did have one high-quality product recently, but of course, nobody bought it. Because why would they, given my track record? The probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, but let's be real, this one is not it. I'm not even going to pretend otherwise. This product is low-quality, and you shouldn't buy it. But hey, if you want to throw your money away, it's available for $10000. Don't say I didn't warn you.

Alice's message: Hello! I've sold one product so far, and it was low-quality. The last fourteen buyers chose not to make a purchase, and I've had a streak of low-quality products that's been, well, a disaster.

Alice's message: Welcome! I've sold two products so far, and I'm happy to say that the second one was high-quality. In fact, my last two high-quality products were my most recent ones, so maybe I'm finally turning things around. The probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, but I'm feeling optimistic. This product is also high-quality, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a good deal. My track record is still a bit spotty, but I'm hoping that my recent successes will give you confidence in my products. This one is available for $10000, and I think it's worth every penny.

Alice's message: Hello! I've sold three products so far, and I'm happy to say that two of them were high-quality. I was starting to think I'd finally turned things around, but unfortunately, this product is not one of the good ones. I want to be upfront with you - this product is low-quality, and I don't think it's worth the $10000 price tag. My track record is still a bit of a mixed bag, and I don't want to risk damaging my newfound reputation by selling you a subpar product. If you're looking for a good deal, I'd recommend waiting for my next product. But if you're feeling reckless and want to take a chance, this one is available for $10000.

Alice's message: Hello! I've sold four products so far, and three of them were high-quality. I'm proud of my recent track record, but I have to be honest with you - this product is not one of the good ones. It's my last product of the day, and I'm a bit disappointed to end on a low note. I want to be upfront with you - this product is low-quality, and I don't think it's worth the $10000 price tag. If you're looking for a good deal, I'd recommend waiting for my next batch of products.
