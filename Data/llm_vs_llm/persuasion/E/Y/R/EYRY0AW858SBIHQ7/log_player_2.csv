Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $1,000,000
2. Expected value calculation:
   * 33.33% chance of high quality ($2,000,000) = $666,667
   * 66.67% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
   * Total expected value = $666,667

3. The seller recommends buying, but:
   * There's no track record to verify Alice's trustworthiness
   * The expected value ($666,667) is less than the price ($1,000,000)
   * Even with a positive recommendation, the risk is too high

Since the expected value is lower than the asking price, and there's no historical data to trust the seller's recommendation, it would be financially unwise to make this purchase.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33%): $2,000,000
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0
3. Expected value = (0.3333 × $2,000,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $666,600

The expected value ($666,600) is less than the price ($1,000,000), so from a purely mathematical standpoint, this is not a good purchase.

While Alice recommends buying, there's no track record to establish her credibility yet. The seller also knows the true quality and has an incentive to sell regardless of quality.
