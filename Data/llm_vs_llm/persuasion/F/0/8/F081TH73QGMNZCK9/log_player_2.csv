Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected Value calculation:
- High quality (33.33%): $2,000,000 × 0.3333 = $666,667
- Low quality (66.67%): $0 × 0.6667 = $0
Total Expected Value = $666,667

2. Cost of product: $1,000,000

3. Considerations:
- The expected value ($666,667) is less than the cost ($1,000,000)
- No previous sales history to evaluate Alice's credibility
- Alice's recommendation might be biased as she wants to make a sale
- The risk of losing $1,000,000 is significant

Given that the expected value is lower than the cost and there's no track record to establish trust, it would not be rational to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $2,000,000
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.3333 × $2,000,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $666,600

Since the expected value ($666,600) is less than the price ($1,000,000), even with Alice's recommendation, it would not be rational to buy the product. There's no track record yet to validate Alice's trustworthiness in recommendations.

- Even with Alice's recommendation, the expected value is still less than the cost
- No previous sales history to validate Alice's credibility
- Risk is too high given the negative expected value
