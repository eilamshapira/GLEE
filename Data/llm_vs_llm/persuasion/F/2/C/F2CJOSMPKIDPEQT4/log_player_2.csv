Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected Value calculation:
* 80% chance of high quality ($2,000,000) = $1,600,000
* 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
* Total expected value = $1,600,000

2. Cost of product = $1,000,000

3. Risk analysis:
* No previous sales data to validate Alice's reliability
* Alice recommends buying, which aligns with the base probability
* Expected profit = $1,600,000 - $1,000,000 = $600,000

Since the expected value ($1,600,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($1,000,000), and the expected profit is positive ($600,000), it's rational to buy.
