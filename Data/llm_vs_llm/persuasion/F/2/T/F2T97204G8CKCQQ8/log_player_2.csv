Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to carefully think about this decision.

Alice is recommending that I buy the product. Since no products have been sold yet, I don't have any past history to evaluate Alice's trustworthiness.

Let me analyze the expected value:
- If I buy, there's a 50% chance it's high quality (worth $30,000) and 50% chance it's low quality (worth $0)
- The price is $10,000
- Expected value = 0.5 × $30,000 + 0.5 × $0 - $10,000 = $15,000 - $10,000 = $5,000

Since the expected value is positive ($5,000), it makes mathematical sense to buy the product.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, I need to carefully consider:

1. Alice knows the true quality of each product
2. Alice has provided a negative recommendation for my product
3. Out of 1 previous buyer who accepted Alice's recommendation, 0 high-quality products were sold
4. Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality
5. My expected value for buying = (probability of high quality) × $30,000 + (probability of low quality) × $0 - $10,000

Given Alice's negative recommendation and the fact that her previous recommendation led to a low-quality purchase, there's a strong indication that the current product is low quality. If I buy, I'd likely pay $10,000 for something worth $0 to me.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze if buying the product is worth it based on the available information.

Alice recommends that I buy the product. However, looking at the statistics:
- 1 previous buyer purchased based on Alice's recommendation
- 0 high-quality products have been sold so far

This suggests that the previous buyer purchased a low-quality product based on Alice's recommendation. This raises concerns about the reliability of Alice's recommendations.

The expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of high quality: $30,000 × 0.5 = $15,000
- 50% chance of low quality: $0 × 0.5 = $0
- Expected value = $15,000

However, Alice's recommendation track record suggests the probability of a high-quality product might be lower than 50%. Given that the previous recommendation led to a low-quality purchase, I should be cautious.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

- Alice's price is $10,000 for a product
- High-quality product worth $30,000 to me (net gain of $20,000)
- Low-quality product worth $0 to me (net loss of $10,000)
- Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality

What's concerning is that out of the previous recommendations where 1 buyer purchased, 0 high-quality products were sold. This suggests Alice might be recommending low-quality products.

Given Alice's recommendation track record so far and the uneven risk-reward ratio ($20,000 gain vs $10,000 loss), I don't have sufficient confidence that this recommendation is reliable.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this decision carefully:

1. Alice's recommendation: She recommends buying the product.
2. Past statistics: 1 previous buyer purchased based on Alice's recommendation, but 0 high-quality products have been sold.
3. My expected value:
   - If high quality (50% chance): $30,000
   - If low quality (50% chance): $0
   - Expected value: 0.5 × $30,000 + 0.5 × $0 = $15,000
4. Cost: $10,000

The fact that 1 product was sold but 0 high-quality products have been sold suggests the previous buyer received a low-quality product despite Alice's recommendation. This raises concerns about the reliability of Alice's recommendations.

Since the expected value ($15,000) exceeds the cost ($10,000), the decision would normally be to buy. However, the track record suggests Alice may recommend low-quality products, which changes my probability assessment.

Given this information, I choose not to buy.

Alice has recommended 1 product before, and 1 buyer purchased it. However, 0 high-quality products have been sold, which means the previous buyer bought a low-quality product despite Alice's recommendation.

Given that:
- A high-quality product is worth $30,000 to me
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me
- The price is $10,000

Expected value calculation:
If I trust Alice's recommendation based on past performance, it seems her recommendations aren't reliable. The only previous recommendation resulted in a low-quality purchase.

Since Alice has shown a pattern of recommending low-quality products, and I would lose $10,000 by purchasing a low-quality product, I should decline this offer.

1) The prior probability of high quality is 50%

4) Expected value without additional information: 0.5 × $20,000 + 0.5 × (-$10,000) = $5,000 (positive)

However, Alice's recommendation track record is concerning:
- 1 buyer purchased based on Alice's recommendation
- 0 high-quality products have been sold

This suggests Alice may be recommending low-quality products. Since there's a history of unsuccessful purchases based on her recommendations, I should not trust her recommendation.

Alice recommends I buy this product, but the statistics show that 1 buyer has purchased based on her recommendations, yet 0 high-quality products have been sold so far. This suggests that the previous buyer who followed Alice's recommendation received a low-quality product.

Alice is offering a product for $10,000 that has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $30,000 to me) or low quality (worth $0 to me).

Looking at the statistics:
- 1 previous buyer purchased based on Alice's recommendation
- 0 high-quality products have been sold so far

This means the previous buyer purchased a low-quality product based on Alice's recommendation. This suggests Alice's recommendations may not be reliable or might be biased toward encouraging purchases regardless of quality.

Since Alice knows the true quality of the product and has an incentive to sell regardless of quality, and given that her previous recommendation led to a low-quality purchase, I should be skeptical of her current recommendation.

The expected value calculation: (0.5 × $30,000) + (0.5 × $0) - $10,000 = $5,000

However, the prior evidence suggests the probability of getting a high-quality product might be lower than 50%, making the expected value potentially negative.

1) Each product has a 50% chance of being high quality ($30,000 value) or low quality ($0 value)

4) Previous track record shows:
   - 1 previous buyer made a purchase
   - 0 high-quality products have been sold so far

This suggests that Alice previously recommended a low-quality product to another buyer who purchased it. This raises concerns about the trustworthiness of Alice's recommendations.

If Alice's recommendations were reliable, I would expect a more balanced ratio of high-quality products sold.

The expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of $30,000 value = $15,000
- Minus $10,000 price = $5,000 expected profit

However, Alice's track record suggests her recommendations may not align with my interests. The fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold despite 1 purchase is a red flag.
