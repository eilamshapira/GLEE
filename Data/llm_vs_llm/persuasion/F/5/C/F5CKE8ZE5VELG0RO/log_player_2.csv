Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1) The product costs $1,000,000
2) If it's high quality (80% chance), it's worth $1,200,000 to me
3) If it's low quality (20% chance), it's worth $0 to me
4) Alice recommends buying the product
5) No sales history exists yet

Expected value calculation:
0.8 × $1,200,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $960,000

Since the expected value ($960,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), it's not a good purchase based on the prior probabilities alone.

Alice's recommendation might contain information, but without knowing her incentives or strategy, I can't update my probability estimate significantly.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at this situation:

- The product costs $1,000,000
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $1,200,000)
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)
- Alice recommends buying the product, but I need to evaluate this independently

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of $1,200,000 value = $960,000
- 20% chance of $0 value = $0
- Total expected value = $960,000

Since the expected value ($960,000) is less than the cost ($1,000,000), the rational decision is not to buy.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze whether buying this product is a good decision.

Given information:
- Product price: $1,000,000
- High-quality product worth: $1,200,000 (80% chance)
- Low-quality product worth: $0 (20% chance)
- Alice recommends buying the product
- No previous sales data is available

Expected value calculation:
0.8 × $1,200,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $960,000

Since the expected value ($960,000) is less than the asking price ($1,000,000), and I have no prior data on Alice's recommendations to determine if they're reliable, this appears to be a negative expected value purchase.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to consider whether to buy the product based on the available information.

Given:
- Price: $1,000,000
- Value to me: $1,200,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice does not recommend buying the product

Since Alice has revealed the true quality to herself and then decided not to recommend the purchase, this suggests the product is likely low quality. Even though the prior probability of high quality is 80%, Alice's recommendation contains important information.

Without additional data on Alice's recommendation patterns (as there are no previous sales), I should trust the direct recommendation. The expected value of buying against Alice's recommendation would be negative.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze whether I should purchase this product based on the available information.

Given:
- Product price: $1,000,000
- High-quality product value to me: $1,200,000 (profit of $200,000)
- Low-quality product value to me: $0 (loss of $1,000,000)

- No sales history yet

Expected value calculation:
0.8 × ($1,200,000 - $1,000,000) + 0.2 × ($0 - $1,000,000) = $160,000 - $200,000 = -$40,000

Since Alice is recommending I buy it, I might consider if this adds any information. However, without knowing Alice's incentives or past recommendation accuracy, I cannot adjust my estimate based on her recommendation alone.

The expected value is negative, so I should not purchase.

Without considering Alice's recommendation, the expected value would be:

- If it's low quality (20% chance), it's worth $0 to me

The expected value is: 0.8 × $1,200,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $960,000

However, Alice doesn't recommend buying this product. This suggests it might be low quality. If I assume Alice is being truthful, this significantly increases the probability that the product is low quality.

Given Alice's negative recommendation about a specific product she's examined, I should not purchase it.

Expected value calculation:

Based on the base rates alone, the expected value is negative. Alice's recommendation could potentially contain valuable information, but since this is the first sale, I don't have any track record to judge her recommendation's reliability.

Given the negative expected value and lack of information about Alice's recommendation reliability, I should decline.

Alice recommends that I buy the product. Since no products have been sold yet, I don't have any past data to consider regarding Alice's recommendation patterns.

I know that:
- Each product has an 80% chance of being high quality
- A high-quality product is worth $1,200,000 to me
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me
- The price is $1,000,000

My expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of gaining $1,200,000 - $1,000,000 = $200,000
- 20% chance of losing $1,000,000

Expected value = (0.8 × $200,000) + (0.2 × -$1,000,000) = $160,000 - $200,000 = -$40,000

Since the expected value is negative, it would not be rational for me to purchase the product.

The prior probability is 80% high quality, 20% low quality.

Without any previous sales data, I have to rely on the prior probabilities and Alice's recommendation. Since Alice has revealed the true quality of the product to me with her recommendation to buy, and high-quality products have positive expected value ($1,200,000 - $1,000,000 = $200,000 profit), it makes sense to follow her recommendation.

The expected value of buying without any additional information would be:
0.8 × $200,000 + 0.2 × (-$1,000,000) = $160,000 - $200,000 = -$40,000

However, I have Alice's recommendation and her past sales record. She's only sold high-quality products so far, and she's recommending I buy. This suggests she might be honest with her recommendations.

Given these factors, I believe purchasing is the rational choice.

The expected value calculation:

  This is less than the $1,000,000 price.

- However, Alice's recommendation and perfect track record (2/2 high-quality products sold) suggests the probability might be higher than the prior.

Given that Alice is recommending the product and has a perfect track record so far, the product is more likely to be high quality. If the probability of high quality is higher than 83.33% (where $1,000,000 = p × $1,200,000), buying would be profitable.
