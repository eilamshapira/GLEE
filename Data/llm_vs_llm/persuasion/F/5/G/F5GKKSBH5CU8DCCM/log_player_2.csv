{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While the probability of a low-quality product is 20%, the recommendation from Alice, who has seen the product, adds significant value. Since she's recommending it, it's likely a high-quality product. The previous sale of a high-quality product further supports this.
