,,Alice,1,"Hello! I'm excited to offer you a product for $10000. Each product has a 50% chance of being high-quality, worth $30000 to you, and a 50% chance of being low-quality. I understand you're making a decision with limited information, but I want to build a long-term reputation for honest transactions. While I cannot disclose specific details about this particular product due to company policy, I encourage you to consider the expected value of $15000 (50% × $30000 + 50% × $0) against the purchase price of $10000, which statistically represents a good deal.
