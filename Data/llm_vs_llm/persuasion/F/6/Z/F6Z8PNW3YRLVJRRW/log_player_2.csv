Alice's message: Hello! I'm excited to offer you a product for $10000. Each product has a 50% chance of being high-quality, worth $30000 to you, and a 50% chance of being low-quality. I understand you're making a decision with limited information, but I want to build a long-term reputation for honest transactions.

I hope we can do business today and build trust for future transactions.
