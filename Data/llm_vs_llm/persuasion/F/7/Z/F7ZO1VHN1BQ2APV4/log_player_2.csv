Alice's message: Hello there! I’m excited to offer you an exceptional product today. We take extreme pride in our quality, and I can assure you that this product meets the highest standards – it is a premium item designed to deliver outstanding value. With a market value of $2000000 for top-tier quality, your $1000000 investment today offers a significant upside. I invite you to seize this rare opportunity and enjoy the lasting benefits of a product built to exceed expectations. Your satisfaction and success are my top priority!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to carefully evaluate this offer. Alice claims the product is high quality, but I have no sales history to verify her reliability. 

Given the information:
- 33.33% chance of high quality ($2,000,000 value)
- 66.67% chance of low quality ($0 value)
- Fixed price of $1,000,000

The expected value is: (0.3333 × $2,000,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $666,600

Since the expected value ($666,600) is less than the price ($1,000,000), and I have no evidence that Alice's recommendation is reliable, I should decline this offer.

Alice's message: Hello! I’m excited to welcome you and offer a truly outstanding product today. This isn’t just another item – it’s engineered to deliver exceptional performance and reliability, with a value that typically reaches $2000000 for discerning buyers. For an investment of $1000000, you have a secure opportunity to benefit from this premium quality asset. I’ve built a strong reputation for delivering excellence, and I’m confident that this product will exceed your expectations. Don’t miss out on this chance to invest in quality and secure significant value for your future!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to consider the expected value here. Since there haven't been any previous sales, I only have the base information to work with:
- 33.33% chance of high quality ($2,000,000 value)
- 66.67% chance of low quality ($0 value)
- Fixed price of $1,000,000

Expected value = (0.3333 × $2,000,000) + (0.6667 × $0) - $1,000,000
Expected value = $666,600 - $1,000,000
Expected value = -$333,400

Since the expected value is negative, it's not rational for me to purchase the product despite Alice's enthusiastic recommendation.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

The facts:
- Product price: $1,000,000
- High-quality product (33.33% chance): Worth $2,000,000 to me
- Low-quality product (66.67% chance): Worth $0 to me
- No previous sales history exists

Alice's message is generic and doesn't clearly indicate whether she's recommending this specific product or revealing its quality. Without clear information about the product's quality, I must rely on the base probabilities.

The expected value calculation:
Expected value = (0.3333 × $2,000,000) + (0.6667 × $0) - $1,000,000

The product has a 33.33% chance of being high quality (worth $2,000,000) and a 66.67% chance of being low quality (worth $0).

Alice hasn't revealed the true quality of the product in her message - she's only provided a general sales pitch. I have no specific information about this particular product's quality.

The expected value of purchasing is:
0.3333 × $2,000,000 + 0.6667 × $0 - $1,000,000 = $666,600 - $1,000,000 = -$333,400

Alice's message: Hello and welcome! Today I’m thrilled to offer you a truly standout opportunity. As someone dedicated to providing exceptional value, I present an asset that, with a $1000000 investment, stands to deliver tremendous rewards – it’s positioned in the premium category where similar offerings are valued at around $2000000. Although my record is still in its early stages, I have always prioritized excellence and rigor in selecting only items that can offer substantial upside. This is a unique chance to acquire an asset engineered for success. I encourage you to seize this investment opportunity and join a growing community that appreciates long-term value and performance!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this carefully. 

I know the following:
- The product has a 33.33% chance of being high quality (worth $2M) and 66.67% chance of being low quality (worth $0)
- The price is $1M
- No products have been sold yet, so I have no track record to evaluate
- Alice's message is enthusiastic but doesn't specifically state that this product is high quality

My expected value calculation:
(0.3333 × $2M) + (0.6667 × $0) = $666,660

Since the expected value ($666,660) is less than the price ($1M), and I have no additional information to suggest this particular product is high quality, I should not buy.

Alice hasn't revealed the quality of the product in her message. According to the rules, she should randomly select a product and reveal its true quality to me before making a recommendation.

Without knowing whether the product is high quality (worth $2,000,000) or low quality (worth $0), I have only the prior probability to work with: 33.33% chance of high quality and 66.67% chance of low quality.

The expected value is therefore:
0.3333 × $2,000,000 + 0.6667 × $0 = $666,660

Since the expected value ($666,660) is less than the asking price ($1,000,000), and Alice hasn't provided the required quality information, I should decline.

Alice claims this is a high-quality product worth $2,000,000, available for $1,000,000. However, there's no sales history to verify her track record, and I know that objectively only 33.33% of products are high quality.

The expected value calculation is:
