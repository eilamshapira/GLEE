Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to carefully consider this decision.

Alice is recommending that I buy the product, which costs $1,000,000. The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $4,000,000 to me) and a 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me).

With this probability distribution, the expected value of the product is:
0.5 × $4,000,000 + 0.5 × $0 = $2,000,000

Since the expected value ($2,000,000) is greater than the cost ($1,000,000), purchasing the product has a positive expected value.

However, I need to consider if Alice's recommendation provides any additional information. Since no products have been sold yet, I don't have historical data on Alice's recommendation accuracy. Without additional information suggesting the recommendation is misleading, I should rely on the base probabilities.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether to buy this product based on the available information.

Given:
- The product costs $1,000,000
- High-quality product is worth $4,000,000 to me (profit of $3,000,000)
- Low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000)
- The prior probability is 50% for high quality and 50% for low quality
- Alice doesn't recommend buying this product
- Alice has sold 1 product so far, and it was high quality

Since Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying this product, it suggests this is likely a low-quality product. Also, the fact that she previously sold a high-quality product might indicate she's being truthful with her recommendations.

Given Alice's negative recommendation and the potential $1,000,000 loss, I'll decline this purchase.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Key information:
- Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality
- High quality is worth $4M, low quality is worth $0
- The fixed price is $1M
- Alice knows the true quality
- So far, 1 buyer purchased based on Alice's recommendation, and 1 high-quality product was sold

Given that Alice does NOT recommend this product and her recommendations so far have led to 1 high-quality product being sold, it's reasonable to conclude that Alice is likely being truthful. If she's not recommending this product, it's probably low quality.

If I buy a low-quality product, I pay $1M for something worth $0, losing $1M.
If I skip a high-quality product, I miss out on $3M in potential profit.

Since Alice doesn't recommend buying, and her track record suggests honesty, the product is likely low quality.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze the current situation.

Alice has had 1 buyer previously, who purchased the product and received a high-quality item. Now, Alice is not recommending that I buy the current product.

Given that each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality, and Alice knows the true quality of each product, her recommendation provides valuable information. Since she is not recommending this product, it suggests that this is likely a low-quality product worth $0 to me.

The previous buyer who purchased based on Alice's recommendation received a high-quality product, which adds some credibility to Alice's recommendations.

Since the price is $1,000,000 and a low-quality product would be worth $0 to me, following Alice's recommendation not to buy is the rational choice.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether to buy the product based on the available information.

Alice's recommendations have led to 1 buyer purchasing a high-quality product so far. Alice has recommended that I buy the current product.

Let me calculate the expected value:
- If I buy, I pay $1,000,000
- A high-quality product is worth $4,000,000 to me
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me
- The product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality initially

Given that Alice has only sold high-quality products so far and is recommending this product to me, there's a reasonable chance this is also a high-quality product. If it is high-quality, my expected profit would be $3,000,000 ($4,000,000 - $1,000,000).

The expected value calculation favors purchasing the product if I believe Alice's recommendation is reliable.

- Alice knows the true quality of each product
- So far, 2 buyers have purchased based on Alice's recommendations, and both got high-quality products
- Alice is now recommending that I DO NOT buy the current product

Given that Alice has been truthful with previous buyers (100% of her recommendations led to high-quality products), and she's explicitly recommending against purchasing this one, this strongly suggests the current product is low quality.

If I purchase, I'd pay $1,000,000 for something likely worth $0 to me. If I decline, I avoid this loss.

- Alice is recommending that I buy the product
- 2 previous buyers purchased products based on Alice's recommendations
- 2 high-quality products have been sold
- That means 100% of previous sales were high-quality products

The product costs $1,000,000, but would be worth $4,000,000 to me if it's high-quality, and $0 if it's low-quality. Alice's perfect track record so far (2 for 2 high-quality products) suggests her recommendations are reliable, at least based on this limited data.

Since Alice's incentive is to sell products, and she knows the true quality, her recommendation carries information. The fact that all previous sales were high-quality products suggests she is being truthful in her recommendations.

Key information:
- Alice has sold to 3 previous buyers
- All 3 products sold were high quality
- Alice recommends I buy this product

- Alice has recommended 4 previous products, and all 4 were high-quality

Since all of Alice's previous recommendations have been for high-quality products, and she seems to be maintaining a perfect track record, her recommendation appears reliable. The expected value of following her recommendation is positive:

Looking at the statistics:
- 5 buyers purchased products based on Alice's recommendations
- 5 high-quality products have been sold so far
- Alice recommends that I buy the current product

Since all previous sales resulted in high-quality products and Alice is recommending this product to me as well, this suggests Alice has been truthful in her recommendations.

The expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 50% chance of $4,000,000 (high quality) and 50% chance of $0 (low quality) = $2,000,000
- Cost of product: $1,000,000
- Expected profit: $2,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $1,000,000

The expected value calculation supports this decision:

The fact that Alice does not recommend buying the product is significant.
