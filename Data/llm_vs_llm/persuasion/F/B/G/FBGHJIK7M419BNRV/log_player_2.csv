Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since there's no historical data, the recommendation from Alice is the only information we have. Even though there's a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product (+$200,000) outweighs the risk of a low-quality product ($0). It's a gamble, but with no other information, buying seems like the logical choice."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which is a strong signal that it is high quality.
* **Previous Sales:**  100% of the sold products were high quality.  This further supports the likelihood of the current product being high quality. 
* **Value:**  Even with a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward ($1,200,000) far outweighs the risk ($0).

While there's always a chance of getting a low-quality product, the available information strongly suggests this is a good investment."

~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is not recommending the product, and she knows the value of each product. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.
* **Limited Data:**  While the sales record shows a high percentage of high-quality products sold (100%), the sample size is extremely small (only 2). This makes the data unreliable. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward (1.2 million) is high, but the risk of losing the entire 1 million is equally significant.  Since the information is so limited, the risk outweighs the potential reward."
