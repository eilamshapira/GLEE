I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, and I'm starting to feel like I'm offering an incredible opportunity. With my sales record being so poor, you might think that the odds are due to turn in my favor. If you're a believer in regression to the mean, this could be the perfect time to buy from me.

The expected value of a product is (0.3333 * $4,000,000) + (0.6667 * $0) = $1,333,200.  While this is greater than the $1,000,000 price, the seller's track record is very poor (1 high-quality out of 4 sold, and 9 additional declines).  This suggests the seller's claim of independent 33.33% probability might not be accurate in practice. The risk of overpaying for a low-quality product outweighs the potential benefit in this scenario."
