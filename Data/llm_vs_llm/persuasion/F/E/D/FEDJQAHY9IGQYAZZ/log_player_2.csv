- Alice hasn't revealed the quality of this specific product

- The expected value of a random product is: (0.3333 × $1,250,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $416,625, which is less than the asking price of $1,000,000

With transparent business practices and a commitment to customer satisfaction, I invite you to make this intelligent investment choice. Would you like to proceed with this exceptional opportunity?

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully.

If a product is high quality (33.33% chance), it's worth $1,250,000 to me, giving me a profit of $250,000.
If it's low quality (66.67% chance), it's worth $0, meaning I'd lose $1,000,000.

Expected value = (0.3333 × $250,000) + (0.6667 × -$1,000,000) = $83,325 - $666,700 = -$583,375
