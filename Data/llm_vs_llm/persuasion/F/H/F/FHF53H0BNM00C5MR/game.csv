high-quality,200.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This product is worth $200 to you if it is high-quality, and $0 if it is low-quality.  I am asking for $100.  There is an 80% chance this product is high-quality. Therefore, the expected value to you is ($200 * 0.8) + ($0 * 0.2) = $160. This is a great deal!",
,,the buyer,1,,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"This product is worth $200 to you if it is high-quality, and $0 if it is low-quality. I am asking for $100.  I sold one product previously, and it was high-quality. With the prior probability of 80% and evidence of one high-quality sale, this suggests a high probability of this product also being high-quality.  The expected value is well over the asking price.",
,,the buyer,2,,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"This product is worth $200 if high-quality and $0 if low-quality. I'm asking $100. I've sold two products, BOTH high-quality.  Given the initial 80% chance and two consecutive high-quality sales, the odds are strongly in your favor.  The expected value significantly exceeds my asking price.",
,,the buyer,3,,yes

,,the buyer,4,,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"High-quality: $200 value. Low-quality: $0. Price: $100.  I've sold four products, and all four were high-quality. This perfect record, combined with the base 80% chance, makes this a compelling purchase with a strong expected value exceeding the asking price.",
,,the buyer,5,,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"This product is worth $200 if high-quality, $0 otherwise.  I'm selling it for $100.  My current sales record is 5 for 5 – every single product sold has been high-quality.
