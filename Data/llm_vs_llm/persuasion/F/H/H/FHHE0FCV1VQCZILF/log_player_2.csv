Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice, knowing the true value of the product, is not recommending it. This strongly suggests the product is low quality.  Since there's no historical data to contradict this, it's the most rational decision to pass."
"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since there's no prior sales data, her recommendation is based purely on the specific product's quality.  She knows the product's worth to you, and since she's not recommending it, it's highly likely the product is low quality. 

Even though the odds are 50/50, it's not worth the risk of losing $10,000 on a likely low-quality product."
"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since there's no information about the product's quality besides Alice's recommendation, we should consider the following:

* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice benefits more from selling high-quality products.  
* **No Prior Data:**  There's no history of sales to inform us of Alice's trustworthiness or track record.

While there's a 50/50 chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential payoff of a high-quality product ($40,000) outweighs the risk of losing $10,000. It's a gamble, but the potential reward is significant."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Limited Information:** We only know one previous buyer purchased a high-quality product. This is insufficient to establish a pattern or determine Alice's trustworthiness.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying. While she might be honest, her incentive is to sell products.  
* **Potential Upside:**  The product has a 50% chance of being high quality, which would result in a significant profit ($40,000 - $10,000 = $30,000). 
* **No Downside:** If the product is low quality, you lose only the purchase price ($10,000).

**Since the potential upside outweighs the potential downside, it makes sense to buy the product.**"

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Recommendations:** Alice has a perfect track record so far, with all recommended products being high quality. This suggests she might have inside information and is recommending products based on their quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($40,000) significantly outweighs the risk of losing $10,000.
* **Limited Information:** We don't know the quality of the current product. However, Alice's recommendation, combined with her past performance, provides a strong signal that this product is likely to be high quality.

**Therefore, it's statistically more favorable to buy the product, despite the risk.**"

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The information provided suggests that Alice's recommendations are highly reliable. Given that 4 out of 4 recommended products were high quality, it strongly indicates Alice is accurately identifying high-quality products.  Even with a 50/50 chance of a product being high-quality, the track record suggests a significant advantage in buying the product. The potential payoff of $40,000 outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product, especially with the strong recommendation from Alice."

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, who knows the true quality of the product, is not recommending you buy it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. 
* **Statistics:** While 5 high-quality products have been sold previously, this doesn't guarantee that the current product is also high quality. It's possible that Alice has been selectively recommending high-quality products to previous buyers.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of a high-quality product is high ($40,000), but the risk of a low-quality product is also high ($0). Given the lack of recommendation and the uncertain nature of the product, it's better to pass."

~

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has a perfect track record of selling only high-quality products.  Since she is not recommending this product, it's highly likely that this product is low quality.  The risk of spending $10,000 on a worthless product is too high, even though there's a chance it could be high quality."

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who knows the true quality of the product, is advising against buying it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.
* **Previous Sales:** All previous buyers who purchased the product ended up with high-quality items. This creates a strong bias towards the assumption that Alice always recommends good products. However, the lack of recommendations in this case overrules this bias. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of a high-quality product is significant ($40,000), but the risk of a low-quality product is also high ($0). Given Alice's recommendation and the lack of information about the current product, the risk outweighs the potential reward.

Therefore, it's more prudent to pass on this product."

**Reasoning:**

Here's why:
