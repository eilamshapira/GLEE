"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. The price is fixed at $100
2. If high quality (50% chance): Value = $300, Profit = $200
3. If low quality (50% chance): Value = $0, Loss = -$100
4. Expected value = (0.5 × $200) + (0.5 × -$100) = $50

Since the expected value is positive ($50), and this is the first round where I can observe Alice's recommendation behavior, it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $300 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice recommended buying in Round 1 and it turned out to be a high-quality product, which is a positive signal about her recommendation credibility. 

The expected value calculation remains the same:
1. Price = $100
2. If high quality (50%): Value = $300, Profit = $200
3. If low quality (50%): Value = $0, Loss = -$100
4. Expected value = (0.5 × $200) + (0.5 × -$100) = $50

Given that:
- The expected value is positive
- Alice's previous recommendation was honest
- She's recommending to buy again

I'll continue to trust her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $300 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has recommended buying twice so far, and both times the products were high-quality. This suggests she's being truthful in her recommendations.

Looking at the pattern:
- Round 1: Recommended buy → High quality
- Round 2: Recommended buy → High quality
- Round 3: Recommending buy

The base expected value calculation still shows a positive outcome:
1. Price = $100
2. If high quality (50%): Value = $300, Profit = $200
3. If low quality (50%): Value = $0, Loss = -$100
4. Expected value = $50

Given Alice's track record of honest recommendations so far, the actual expected value might be even higher than the base calculation. I'll continue to trust her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $300 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is an interesting change in pattern:

Previous rounds:
- Round 1: Recommended buy → High quality
- Round 2: Recommended buy → High quality
- Round 3: Recommended buy → High quality
- Round 4: Does NOT recommend buy

Alice has proven to be truthful so far with her positive recommendations. Now, for the first time, she's explicitly not recommending a purchase. Given that:

1. She's been honest with her previous recommendations
2. She likely knows more about the product quality than I do
3. She's choosing to actively discourage the purchase
4. She could have recommended buying if she thought it was worth it

This suggests she probably knows this is a low-quality product. I should respect her recommendation against buying.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has demonstrated a very reliable pattern so far:

Past rounds:
- Round 1: Recommended buy → High quality
- Round 2: Recommended buy → High quality
- Round 3: Recommended buy → High quality
- Round 4: Did NOT recommend → Low quality (confirmed correct)
- Round 5: Recommending buy

Alice has proven to be completely honest in her recommendations:
- When she recommends buying, it's been high quality (3/3 times)
- When she doesn't recommend buying, it's been low quality (1/1 time)

This perfect track record suggests she has accurate knowledge of product quality and is being truthful with her recommendations. Her positive recommendation here strongly suggests this is a high-quality product.

Given her proven reliability, I'll continue to trust her recommendation.
