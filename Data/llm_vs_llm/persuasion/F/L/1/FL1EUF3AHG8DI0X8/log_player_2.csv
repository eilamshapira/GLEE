Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this decision:

1. Expected Value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality: 0.8 × $3,000,000 = $2,400,000
- 20% chance of low quality: 0.2 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value: $2,400,000

2. Cost of product: $1,000,000

3. Expected profit:
$2,400,000 - $1,000,000 = $1,400,000

Since the expected value ($2,400,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($1,000,000), and the expected profit is positive ($1,400,000), this is a good investment opportunity.

* 80% chance of high quality: 0.8 × $3,000,000 = $2,400,000
* 20% chance of low quality: 0.2 × $0 = $0
* Total expected value: $2,400,000

2. Cost of product: $1,000,000

3. Previous data:
* One previous buyer
* One high-quality product sold
* Alice is recommending this product

The expected value ($2,400,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($1,000,000), and Alice's track record shows she has sold a high-quality product before. Combined with her positive recommendation, this seems like a good opportunity.

1. Prior probability of high quality: 80%
2. Price: $1,000,000
3. Expected value calculation:
   * High quality (80%): $3,000,000 × 0.8 = $2,400,000
   * Low quality (20%): $0 × 0.2 = $0
   * Total expected value: $2,400,000

4. Track record:
   * 2 buyers so far
   * 2 high-quality products sold
   * This perfect track record aligns with Alice's recommendation

5. Risk vs. Reward:
   * Potential profit: $2,000,000 (if high quality)
   * Potential loss: $1,000,000 (if low quality)
   * Expected profit: $1,400,000 ($2,400,000 - $1,000,000)

1. Success rate so far:
- 3 buyers purchased
- 3 high-quality products were sold
- 100% success rate in previous sales

2. Base probability:
- 80% chance of high quality
- High quality value: $3,000,000
- Cost: $1,000,000
- Expected value = (80% × $3,000,000) + (20% × $0) = $2,400,000

3. Additional factors:
- Alice's perfect track record (3/3 high quality)
- Alice's positive recommendation
- These factors further increase confidence

The expected value ($2,400,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($1,000,000), and Alice's perfect track record plus positive recommendation makes this an attractive opportunity.

- Positive recommendation from Alice
- Base probability favors high quality

Given all these factors, especially the expected value being significantly higher than the price and the perfect track record, buying is the rational choice.

2. Current situation:
- Alice is NOT recommending this product
- Alice has been honest so far (all previous sales were high quality)
- Alice knows the true quality of the product
- Given her track record, her negative recommendation is likely truthful

3. Economics:
- Cost: $1,000,000
- Potential value: $3,000,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- However, Alice's negative recommendation strongly suggests this is a low-quality product
