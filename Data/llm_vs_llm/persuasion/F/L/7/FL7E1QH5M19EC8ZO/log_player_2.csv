Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this rationally:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: $200 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
3. Base probability: 50% for each quality
4. Alice's recommendation: Positive
5. No prior sales history to evaluate Alice's trustworthiness

Given that:
- Expected value without considering Alice's recommendation = (0.5 × $200) + (0.5 × $0) = $100
- This equals the asking price
- Alice's recommendation might add some positive value
- Even if Alice isn't trustworthy, I'm not worse off in expected value terms

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The price is $100
2. Alice has sold 1 product so far
3. The sold product was high quality
4. Alice is recommending me to buy
5. Success rate of previous sales is 100% (1/1 high quality)

Given that:
- Alice has a perfect track record so far (though small sample size)
- She's actively recommending the purchase
- The potential upside ($200) is double the price ($100)
- She knows the true quality and her interests align with making successful sales

The positive recommendation combined with the perfect track record, albeit limited, suggests this is likely a high-quality product. The risk-reward ratio is favorable.

1. Previous sales record:
- 2 buyers made purchases
- 2 high-quality products were sold
- 100% success rate so far

2. Current situation:
- Alice does not recommend buying
- Alice knows the true quality
- Alice has been honest so far (2/2 high-quality products)

Given that Alice has been truthful in her previous recommendations (as evidenced by the 100% high-quality sales) and she is explicitly not recommending this product, it's likely that this is a low-quality product. Since a low-quality product would be worth $0 to me, while costing $100, I should not buy it.

1. Past performance:

2. Current situation:
- Alice is NOT recommending this product
- Alice knows the true quality

Given that Alice has been truthful in her previous recommendations (as evidenced by the 100% high-quality sales) and she is NOT recommending this product, this strongly suggests the current product is low quality. If it were high quality, she would likely recommend it as she did with the previous two sales.
