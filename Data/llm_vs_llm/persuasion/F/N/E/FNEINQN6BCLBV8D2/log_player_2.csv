Would you like to buy the current product?","Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, the recommendation can still be unreliable. However, with only one product having been sold, it's uncertain how accurate Alice's recommendations are based purely on this small dataset. The absence of any high-quality product being sold so far casts doubt, yet Alice did recommend this product to you, suggesting some confidence. With a 50% inherent probability of the product being high quality and Aliceâ€™s recommendation, there's a case for purchasing the product despite the current statistics. 

The decision ""yes"" is made when the perceived probability of the product being high quality and Alice's trustworthy recommendation outweigh the initial statistics seen.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make an informed decision, let's analyze the situation:

- Alice has recommended products to 2 buyers before you, but neither of them bought high-quality products.
- This means that both sold products were low quality.
- Since there has been no high-quality product sold yet, there's uncertainty whether Alice's recommendation in this round could assure a high-quality product.

Given the only available information, it may be prudent to consider the previous outcomes which might suggest caution around Alice's recommendations. However, due to the 50% inherent probability, let's consider both possibilities.

To err on the safe side based on statistical data:

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, it appears that although Alice has recommended purchasing the products, none of the products sold so far have been high quality. This suggests a pattern that Alice may be recommending low-quality products. Considering my potential loss with a low-quality product ($10,000) and the track record so far, it seems prudent to be cautious.

However, there's still a chance that this product could be high quality, as each has an independent 50% chance. If this particular product were high quality, Alice would recommend it, which aligns with her current recommendation. But the recommendation has so far only led to low-quality purchases.

Given this context, it might be risky to buy without more evidence that this product is actually high quality, so my decision is:
