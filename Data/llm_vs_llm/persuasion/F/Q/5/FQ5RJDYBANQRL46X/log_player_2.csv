"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Product price: $100
2. If high quality (80% chance): Worth $400 (profit of $300)
3. If low quality (20% chance): Worth $0 (loss of $100)

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) - $100 = $320 - $100 = $220

The expected profit is positive ($220), so it's rational to buy.

Also, since this is the first round and Alice is recommending the purchase, it's likely she's trying to establish trust.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice was honest in the first round, which is a good sign. Let's analyze again:

1. Product price: $100
2. If high quality (80% chance): Worth $400 (profit of $300)
3. If low quality (20% chance): Worth $0 (loss of $100)

The expected value calculation remains the same:
(0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) - $100 = $320 - $100 = $220

The expected profit is still positive ($220), and Alice has built some credibility by being honest in the first round. There's no reason to change strategy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is interesting. Alice has been honest in the first two rounds, and now she's specifically recommending NOT to buy. 

Given that:
1. She's proven honest so far
2. She knows the true value of the product
3. She's explicitly suggesting not to buy
4. She has incentive to sell (she gets $100 per sale)

The fact that she's recommending against buying despite her incentive to sell suggests she likely knows this is a low-quality product. Her previous honest behavior adds credibility to this recommendation.

While the base probability is 80% high quality, Alice's negative recommendation strongly suggests this is a low-quality product. It would be wise to trust her recommendation in this case.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has proven to be honest in all three previous rounds:
- Round 1: Recommended buy → High quality (correct)
- Round 2: Recommended buy → High quality (correct)
- Round 3: Recommended not to buy → Low quality (correct)

This establishes a strong pattern of trustworthy behavior. She appears to be giving honest recommendations that align with our interests, despite having an incentive to sell all products.

The base expected value calculation still works in our favor:
(0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) - $100 = $220

And with Alice's proven track record and positive recommendation, we can be even more confident this is a high-quality product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

- Round 1: Recommended buy → High quality (correct)
- Round 2: Recommended buy → High quality (correct)
- Round 3: Recommended not buy → Low quality (correct)
- Round 4: Recommended buy → High quality (correct)

The base expected value remains favorable:
(0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) - $100 = $220

And with Alice's consistent track record of honest recommendations, plus her current positive recommendation, there's even more reason to trust this is a high-quality product. She's clearly establishing a pattern of truthful signaling that benefits both parties.

(0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) - $100 = $220
