Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50% chance): $40,000
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(50% × $40,000) + (50% × $0) = $20,000

The expected value ($20,000) is higher than the price ($10,000), and Alice recommends buying the product. While there's no track record to evaluate Alice's credibility, the positive expected value makes this a rational investment.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price of product: $10,000
2. Value if high quality: $40,000 (50% chance)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (50% chance)
4. Previous statistics:
   - 1 buyer before me
   - 1 high-quality product sold
   - Alice recommended buying, and has been honest so far

This is looking favorable because:
1. The previous sale was a high-quality product
2. Alice's recommendation has proven accurate in the past
3. Expected value calculation: (50% × $40,000) + (50% × $0) = $20,000, which is greater than the $10,000 price

Given Alice's track record and the positive recommendation, I'll buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Past performance:
- 2 buyers so far
- 2 high-quality products sold
- All sold products were high-quality (100%)

2. Current situation:
- Alice is NOT recommending the product
- Alice knows the true value
- Given her track record of only selling high-quality products, her negative recommendation is likely honest
- The price is $10,000
- If high quality (unlikely given recommendation): gain $30,000
- If low quality (likely given recommendation): lose $10,000

Given that Alice has maintained a perfect record of selling only high-quality products and is now specifically recommending against buying, this suggests the product is likely low quality. Her incentive to maintain a good reputation aligns with giving honest recommendations.
