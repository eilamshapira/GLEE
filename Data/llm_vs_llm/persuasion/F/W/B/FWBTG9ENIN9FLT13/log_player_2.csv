"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information:

*   **Price:** $10,000
*   **High Quality Probability:** 33.33% (Worth $40,000)
*   **Low Quality Probability:** 66.67% (Worth $0)

Without Alice's recommendation, the expected value of buying a product is (0.3333 * $40,000) + (0.6667 * $0) = $13,332. Since the price is $10,000, it would be profitable to buy.

However, Alice is recommending to buy. This suggests the product is more likely to be high quality than the prior probability. Thus it will be even more profitable to buy.
