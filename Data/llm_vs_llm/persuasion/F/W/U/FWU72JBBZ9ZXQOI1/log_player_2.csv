Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50% chance): $1,250,000
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (50% × $1,250,000) + (50% × $0) = $625,000

4. Considerations:
   - No sales history to reference
   - Alice recommends buying
   - Expected value ($625,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000)

Since the expected value is significantly lower than the asking price, and there's no historical data to build trust, it would be financially unwise to make this purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Expected value calculation:
   * 50% chance of high quality ($1,250,000) = $625,000
   * 50% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
   * Total expected value = $625,000

3. Alice recommends buying, but:
   * There's no track record to verify her trustworthiness
   * She has incentive to sell regardless of quality
   * Her recommendation alone isn't enough to change the base probabilities

4. Decision factors:
   * Expected value ($625,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000)
   * No historical data to build trust
   * Risk of complete loss is 50%

Given that the expected value is significantly below the asking price, it would not be rational to buy.
