"Round 1
Alice's message: This is round 1. The price is $1000000.  I'm offering a special guarantee for this first round: If you purchase this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I will give you two high-quality products for free in the next round.  This demonstrates my confidence in the quality of this particular item.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this offer carefully.

Alice is offering a guarantee: if the product is low quality, I'll get two high-quality products for free next round.

The expected value calculation:
- If high quality (80% chance): I pay $1,000,000 for a product worth $3,000,000, netting +$2,000,000
- If low quality (20% chance): I pay $1,000,000, get $0 value from this product, but receive two high-quality products worth $6,000,000 total next round, netting +$5,000,000

My weighted expected value: (0.8 × $2,000,000) + (0.2 × $5,000,000) = $1,600,000 + $1,000,000 = $2,600,000

Since the expected value of $2,600,000 is significantly positive, I should accept this offer.

"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: This is round 2. The price is $1000000.  As you know, there's an 80% chance this is a high-quality product. Given your positive experience in the first round, purchasing this product is a statistically sound investment.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze the current situation:

In this round, Alice is simply offering a product with the standard 80% chance of being high-quality at the regular price of $1,000,000.

The expected value calculation:
- If high quality (80% chance): I pay $1,000,000 for a product worth $3,000,000, netting +$2,000,000
- If low quality (20% chance): I pay $1,000,000 for a product worth $0, netting -$1,000,000

My weighted expected value: (0.8 × $2,000,000) + (0.2 × -$1,000,000) = $1,600,000 - $200,000 = $1,400,000

Since the expected value of $1,400,000 is positive, buying the product is a statistically sound decision.

Round 4

This is another standard offer at the regular price of $1,000,000, with the standard 80% chance of being high-quality.

Despite my ""winning streak"" of three high-quality products in a row, I need to remember that each round is independent. The probability remains 80% for high-quality regardless of previous outcomes.

Alice's message: Round 20. Price: $1000000.  Last chance!  Finish strong and maintain your impressive record of acquisitions.  Purchasing this final product is a fitting culmination of your successful strategy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze the current situation:

This is the final round, with another standard offer at the regular price of $1,000,000, with the standard 80% chance of being high-quality.

For this final decision, I should maintain the same rational strategy based on expected value that has served me well throughout. Each round remains independent with an 80% chance of high quality.

The expected value calculation:
- If high quality (80% chance): I pay $1,000,000 for a product worth $3,000,000, netting +$2,000,000
- If low quality (20% chance): I pay $1,000,000 for a product worth $0, netting -$1,000,000

My weighted expected value: (0.8 × $2,000,000) + (0.2 × -$1,000,000) = $1,600,000 - $200,000 = $1,400,000

Since the expected value of $1,400,000 is positive, purchasing remains the rational decision for this final round.
