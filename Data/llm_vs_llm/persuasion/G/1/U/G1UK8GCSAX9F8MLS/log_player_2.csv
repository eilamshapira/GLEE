Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $1,000,000
2. High quality value: $1,250,000 (50% chance)
3. Low quality value: $0 (50% chance)
4. Expected value: (0.5 × $1,250,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $625,000
5. Alice knows the true quality and recommends buying
6. No historical data to assess Alice's trustworthiness

Even though Alice recommends buying, without any track record of her honesty, we can only rely on the base expected value calculation. Since the expected value ($625,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), it would not be rational to buy.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50%): $1,250,000
   - Low quality (50%): $0
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $1,250,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $625,000
4. Alice recommends buying
5. No historical data to evaluate Alice's trustworthiness

The expected value ($625,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), and without any track record to establish Alice's credibility, the recommendation alone isn't enough to justify the risk. The potential loss is too high compared to the potential gain.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product costs $1,000,000
2. If high quality (50% chance): worth $1,250,000 (profit of $250,000)
3. If low quality (50% chance): worth $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
4. Expected value = (0.5 × $250,000) + (0.5 × -$1,000,000) = -$375,000

Even though Alice recommends buying the product, with no prior sales history to establish trust, and given that the expected value is negative (-$375,000), it would be too risky to buy.

Based on this, it would be financially unwise to buy. The expected value is significantly below the asking price.
