Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the given information, let's calculate the expected value of buying a product:

- The probability of a product being high quality is 80%, and it's worth $125.
- The probability of a product being low quality is 20%, and it's worth $0.
- The cost of buying a product is $100.

The expected value (EV) of buying a product is:

EV = (0.8 * $125) + (0.2 * $0) - $100 = $100 - $100 = $0

Since the expected value is $0, buying a product is a break-even decision in the long run. However, since we are only playing 20 rounds, there is a risk of not getting the expected distribution of high and low-quality products. Given the information from the previous rounds, I will continue to accept Alice's recommendations.
