Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to determine if purchasing the product is a positive expected value decision.

Given information:
- Product price: $1,000,000
- High-quality probability: 80%
- High-quality value to me: $3,000,000
- Low-quality value to me: $0
- Alice recommends buying the product

Expected value calculation:
0.8 * $3,000,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $2,400,000

Since the expected value ($2,400,000) exceeds the price ($1,000,000), it's rational to purchase.

Alice's recommendation aligns with this calculation, though I don't have prior data on her recommendation reliability since no products have been sold yet.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

- The price of the product is $1,000,000
- A high-quality product is worth $3,000,000 to me
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me
- The prior probability is 80% high-quality, 20% low-quality
- Alice has sold 1 product so far, and it was high-quality
- Alice is recommending that I buy the current product

The expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 0.8 × $3,000,000 + 0.2 × $0 - $1,000,000 = $1,400,000
- If I don't buy: $0

Since Alice is recommending I buy and her previous sale was also a high-quality product, this is consistent with her being truthful. The expected value of buying is positive, so I should buy.

- Low-quality product (20% chance) is worth $0 to me
- Alice has sold to 2 previous buyers, both received high-quality products
- Alice recommends I buy the product

The expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 0.8 × $3,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $1,400,000
- If I don't buy: $0

Based on the prior probability of 80% for high quality and the fact that Alice has maintained a perfect record so far (2/2 high-quality sales), along with her recommendation to buy, it's rational to purchase the product as the expected value is positive.

- Low-quality product worth: $0 (20% chance in general)
- Alice's track record: 3 buyers purchased, all 3 received high-quality products
- Alice is recommending that I buy this product

The expected value of a random product would be:
(0.8 × $3,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) - $1,000,000 = $1,400,000

This is already positive, but Alice's perfect track record and positive recommendation provide additional confidence. The fact that all previous buyers received high-quality products after following Alice's recommendations suggests her recommendations are reliable.

Based on this analysis, buying the product has a positive expected value.

Expected value calculation:

Based on Alice's sales record (5/6 high quality), this seems consistent with the 80% baseline probability.

Alice's recommendation provides additional information. Her track record shows 6/7 (approximately 86%) of recommendations led to high-quality products, which is better than the base rate of 80%.

4. Alice has recommended 8 previous buyers purchase products
5. Of those 8 sales, 7 were high-quality products (87.5% success rate)
6. Alice is recommending I buy this product

The expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of $3,000,000 = $2,400,000
- 20% chance of $0 = $0

Since the expected value ($2,400,000) exceeds the cost ($1,000,000), and Alice's track record shows a high-quality rate (87.5%) that's even better than the base probability (80%), this appears to be a profitable decision.

- If high quality, my expected profit is $3,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $2,000,000
- If low quality, I lose $1,000,000
- 10 buyers before me purchased products, and 9 were high quality (90% success rate)

The fact that Alice has sold 10 high-quality products out of 12 total sales (83.3%) is roughly in line with the base rate of 80%, which suggests Alice's recommendations appear to be reliable.
