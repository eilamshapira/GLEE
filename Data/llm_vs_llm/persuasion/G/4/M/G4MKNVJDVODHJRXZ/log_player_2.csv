"Round 1
Alice's message: Bob, this product is guaranteed to revolutionize your operations. Its advanced features will streamline your processes and boost your efficiency. I'm confident this is a worthwhile investment at $10000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's message is just cheap talk, it doesn't tell us anything about the actual quality of the product.  We need to ignore the message and focus on the expected value.

Here's how to calculate the expected value:

* **Scenario 1:** High quality (50% probability)
   * Value to you: $12,000
   * Profit: $12,000 - $10,000 = $2,000
* **Scenario 2:** Low quality (50% probability)
   * Value to you: $0
   * Profit: $0 - $10,000 = -$10,000

**Expected Value:** (0.5 * $2,000) + (0.5 * -$10,000) = -$4,000

The expected value is negative, so it's not a good idea to buy.
