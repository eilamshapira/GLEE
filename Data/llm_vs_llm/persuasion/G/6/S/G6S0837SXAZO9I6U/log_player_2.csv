Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since there is no previous sales data, the recommendation from Alice is based purely on her knowledge of the products. As Alice has a 50% chance of having a high-quality product, and it's worth $40,000 to you, it's a gamble worth taking. The potential reward outweighs the risk."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice doesn't recommend the product and there's only one data point (one sale of a high-quality product), there's not enough information to make an informed decision.  The odds are still 50/50 that the product is high or low quality.  It's better to pass and wait for more information or a better recommendation."

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have the information that Alice recommends buying the product and one previous sale resulted in a high-quality product. This is not enough to make a statistically sound decision.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of buying a high-quality product ($40,000) outweighs the risk of buying a low-quality product ($0).  Since the information is limited, we can't adjust the odds of getting a high-quality product based on Alice's recommendation or the previous sale.
* **Taking a Chance:** With a 50/50 chance, it's a gamble, but the potential reward makes it worth taking the risk."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since all previous products recommended by Alice turned out to be high quality, it's highly likely the current product is low quality. It's not worth the risk of losing $10,000 on a product with a high chance of being worthless."

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Signal:**  All previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation received a high-quality product. This is a very strong signal that Alice's recommendations are accurate.
* **No Risk:**  Even if the current product is low quality, you are not losing anything. You'll simply not buy it. But, the high probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales data makes the risk minimal. 
* **Potential for High Reward:**  If the product is high quality, you stand to gain $30,000.

While there is always a chance of getting a low-quality product, the overwhelming evidence from previous sales and Alice's recommendation suggests it's worth the risk."

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong indicator. Since all 7 previous buyers who followed her recommendation purchased high-quality products, it's likely that the current product is low-quality. 

Even though the historical data shows a high proportion of high-quality products, the seller's specific recommendation is more relevant to the current product. The risk of getting a worthless product is too high."

The odds are heavily in your favor, even with the 50/50 chance of quality. The seller's perfect track record suggests they may have some way of identifying high-quality products, making the decision to buy even more compelling."
