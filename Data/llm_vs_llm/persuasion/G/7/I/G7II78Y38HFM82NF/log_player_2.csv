"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Possible values:
   - High quality (33.33%): $40,000
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.3333 × $40,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $13,332

Since the expected value ($13,332) is greater than the price ($10,000), it's rational to buy.

Alice's recommendation doesn't change the probability since we don't yet know if her recommendations are reliable.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Interesting. In Round 1, Alice recommended buying a product that turned out to be high quality, which could suggest her recommendations have some value.

Now she's recommending NOT to buy. This new negative recommendation might indicate she's being honest about product quality.

However, it's still too early to fully trust the pattern of her recommendations. Let's look at the base numbers:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Possible values:
   - High quality (33.33%): $40,000
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0

Expected value without considering Alice's recommendation:
(0.3333 × $40,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $13,332

Even though Alice is recommending against buying, we only have one prior data point. The expected value is still mathematically positive without more data about the reliability of her recommendations.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is getting interesting. Let's analyze what we know:

Round 1: Alice recommended to buy → High quality (Good advice)
Round 2: Alice recommended NOT to buy → Low quality (Good advice, but I ignored it)

It appears Alice's recommendations so far have been honest and accurate. She's now again recommending NOT to buy.

Given that:
1. Alice has been truthful in both previous rounds
2. She's explicitly recommending not to buy
3. Last time I ignored her negative recommendation, I lost money
4. She seems to be providing valuable information beyond the base probabilities

While the raw probabilities would suggest buying (expected value $13,332 > $10,000), Alice's track record and current negative recommendation strongly suggest this is likely a low-quality product.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the pattern so far:

Round 1: Recommended buy → High quality (Correct)
Round 2: Recommended don't buy → Low quality (Correct)
Round 3: Recommended don't buy → Low quality (Correct)
Round 4: Recommending buy

Alice has been 100% accurate in her recommendations so far:
- When she recommended buying, it was high quality
- When she recommended not buying, it was low quality

Now she's recommending to buy again. Given her perfect track record of honesty, this strongly suggests this is a high-quality product.

If it is high quality, the value would be:
- Cost: $10,000
- Value: $40,000
- Profit: $30,000

Given Alice's demonstrated reliability and positive recommendation, this appears to be a good opportunity.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Round 3: Recommended don't buy → Low quality (Correct)
Round 4: Recommended buy → High quality (Correct)

Alice has maintained a perfect 4/4 record of accurate recommendations. Her recommendations have proven to be completely reliable indicators of product quality:
- When she says buy → Product has been high quality
- When she says don't buy → Product has been low quality

Given:
1. Her perfect track record of honesty
2. Her current recommendation NOT to buy
3. The previous losses avoided by following her negative recommendations

There's strong evidence to trust her recommendation and avoid this purchase.

{""decision"": ""no""}"

- When she recommends not buying → Product has been low quality (100% accuracy)
