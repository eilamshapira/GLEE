1. Cost of product: $100
2. If high quality: Worth $300 (profit of $200)
3. If low quality: Worth $0 (loss of $100)
4. Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
5. Alice recommends buying
6. No prior sales history to evaluate Alice's truthfulness

Expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of $200 profit = $100
- 50% chance of $100 loss = -$50
- Net expected value = $50

Since Alice recommends buying and the expected value is positive ($50), it's rational to buy.

1. Alice has dealt with 1 previous buyer

6. Alice has recommended to buy
7. Alice's previous recommendation led to a successful high-quality sale

1. Product price: $100

4. Previous sales:
   - 2 buyers purchased
   - 1 high-quality product sold
   - This means 1 low-quality product was sold
5. Alice recommends buying

The previous sales show that Alice has sold both high and low-quality products, suggesting her recommendations aren't completely reliable. With a 50-50 chance and given that her previous recommendations led to one high and one low quality sale, there's still significant risk.

Expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of high quality: 0.5 × $200 (profit) = $100
- 50% chance of low quality: 0.5 × -$100 (loss) = -$50
- Net expected value: $50

While the expected value is positive, the previous sales pattern doesn't give strong confidence in Alice's recommendations.

2. Alice's recommendation:
- Alice is recommending to buy

3. Risk/Reward analysis:
- Cost: $100

- Expected value with 75% success rate: (0.75 × $300) + (0.25 × $0) = $225

3. Decision factors:
- Historical success rate is 60%
- Alice's positive recommendation

1. Previous sales:
- 6 buyers made purchases
- 4 high-quality products were sold

- Alice has demonstrated relatively honest behavior

2. Economics:
- Cost: $100
- Value if high quality: $300 (profit of $200)
- Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $100)
- Base probability: 50% for each quality

3. Alice's recommendation:
- She's recommending to buy
- Her track record shows more high-quality sales than low-quality
- Her recommendation combined with her past behavior suggests this is likely a high-quality product

Given that Alice has maintained a good track record (66.67% high quality) and is actively recommending this product, the expected value is positive. The risk-reward ratio appears favorable.

3) Historical data:
   - 7 buyers so far
   - 4 high-quality products sold (57% high quality)
4) Alice recommends buying

The seller's recommendation and historical track record seem reasonably positive. With 4 out of 7 previous sales being high quality (57%), and a recommendation to buy, the expected value calculation is favorable:

If we trust the historical rate:
57% chance of $300 value - $100 cost = $200 profit
43% chance of $0 value - $100 cost = -$100 loss
Expected value = (0.57 × $200) + (0.43 × -$100) = $71.4

Since the expected value is positive and Alice is recommending the purchase, I'll buy.

3) Alice's recommendation:
- Alice knows the true quality
- Alice is recommending to buy
- However, historical data shows Alice's recommendations have led to 50% success rate

The expected value ($150) is greater than the cost ($100), and while Alice's past performance isn't spectacular, it's not below the base probability either.

3. Previous sales: 9 buyers, 4 high-quality products sold
4. Alice recommends buying

The fact that only 4 out of 9 products sold were high quality (44.4%) is concerning, as it's below the expected 50% rate. This suggests Alice's recommendations might not be very reliable.

However, even with these odds:
- If I buy and get a high-quality product: +$200 profit ($300 - $100)
- If I buy and get a low-quality product: -$100 loss
- Expected value = (0.444 × $200) + (0.556 × -$100) ≈ $11.20

4. Risk assessment:

Given that only 4 out of 10 previous purchases were high quality (40%), and this is worse than random chance (50%), Alice's recommendations appear untrustworthy. The expected value would be: (0.4 × $300) - $100 = $20, but the trend suggests even worse odds.
