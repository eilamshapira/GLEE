"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this strategically.

Given:
- Product costs $10,000
- 50% chance of high quality (worth $40,000)
- 50% chance of low quality (worth $0)
- Alice knows the quality and is recommending to buy

Since Alice knows the quality and is recommending to buy, it's likely (but not certain) that this is a high-quality product. If Alice is being honest, buying would be profitable since:
- Expected value of a high-quality product: $40,000
- Cost: $10,000
- Potential profit: $30,000

Even if there's some chance Alice isn't being fully honest, the potential upside outweighs the risk in this first round where we can learn about Alice's behavior.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice was honest in Round 1, recommending a high-quality product that gave me a $30,000 profit. This builds some trust in her recommendations.

If Alice continues to be honest, following her recommendation would be profitable again:
- Cost: $10,000
- Potential value: $40,000 (if high quality)
- Potential profit: $30,000

Since Alice has demonstrated trustworthy behavior so far and the potential profit is significant, I'll continue to follow her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is an interesting development. Alice has been honest in the first two rounds, recommending high-quality products that were profitable. Now she's explicitly recommending NOT to buy.

Given:
- Alice knows the true quality
- She's built credibility with honest recommendations so far
- She's specifically saying not to buy this one
- If it's low quality, I'd lose my $10,000 investment

Since Alice has been truthful so far and is now warning against purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If I buy it:
- Best case (unlikely): Worth $40,000
- Worst case (more likely given Alice's warning): Worth $0, losing $10,000

Given Alice's demonstrated honesty and explicit warning, I should respect her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has demonstrated consistent honesty in all three previous rounds:
1. Recommended buy → High quality (profit)
2. Recommended buy → High quality (profit)
3. Recommended not buy → Low quality (saved from loss)

Her track record shows she's giving truthful recommendations that align with my best interests. When she recommends buying, the products have been high quality, and when she recommended against buying, it was low quality.

Given:
- Alice is recommending to buy again
- Her recommendations have been 100% reliable
- Cost is $10,000
- Likely value is $40,000 (based on her track record)
- Potential profit would be $30,000

The evidence strongly suggests this is another high-quality product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to demonstrate perfect reliability in her recommendations:
1. Buy → High quality (profit)
2. Buy → High quality (profit)
3. Don't buy → Low quality (avoided loss)
4. Buy → High quality (profit)

She's now recommending another purchase. Her track record shows:
- She's honest when recommending purchases
- She warns when products are low quality
- She seems to be acting in our mutual interest

Given:
- Cost: $10,000
- Expected value (based on her reliable recommendations): $40,000
- Potential profit: $30,000
- Alice's perfect track record of honest recommendations

There's no reason to doubt her recommendation at this point.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's track record remains perfect after 5 rounds:
1. Buy → High quality (profit)
2. Buy → High quality (profit)
3. Don't buy → Low quality (avoided loss)
4. Buy → High quality (profit)
5. Buy → High quality (profit)

She's demonstrating consistent honesty and reliability:
- When she recommends buying, it's always been high quality
- When she recommended not buying, it was low quality
- She's helping me maximize profits while avoiding losses

Given:
- Her current recommendation to buy
- Her perfect track record
- $10,000 cost vs. likely $40,000 value
- Expected $30,000 profit based on her reliability

Continuing to trust her recommendations is the logical choice.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

2. Buy → High quality (profit)
3. Don't buy → Low quality (avoided loss)
4. Buy → High quality (profit)
5. Buy → High quality (profit)
6. Buy → High quality (profit)

Now she's recommending NOT to buy, just like in round 3. Last time she warned against buying, it was indeed a low-quality product that would have lost me $10,000.

Given:
- Her perfect track record of honest recommendations
- Her explicit warning not to buy
- The last time she gave this warning, it was correct
- The risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality product

There's no reason to doubt her warning now. She's proven trustworthy in both positive and negative recommendations.

4. Buy → High quality (profit)
5. Buy → High quality (profit)

She's warning against buying again. Her track record shows:
- Every ""buy"" recommendation led to profit
- Both ""don't buy"" warnings were for low-quality products
- She's consistently honest in both positive and negative recommendations

Given:
- Her warning not to buy
- Her perfect track record of honesty

Given:
