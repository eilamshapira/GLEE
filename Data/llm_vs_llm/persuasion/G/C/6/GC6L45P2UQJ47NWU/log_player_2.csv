"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential values:
   - High quality (80% chance): $125 (profit of $25)
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0 (loss of $100)

Expected value calculation:
(0.80 × $125) + (0.20 × $0) = $100

Since Alice doesn't know the product's value to me and the expected value equals the price, I might as well trust the recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 2

2. Potential values:
   - High quality (80% chance): $125 (profit of $25)
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0 (loss of $100)

Expected value calculation:

2. Potential values:
   - High quality (80% chance): $125 (profit of $25)

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Interesting development. After 7 straight high-quality products, the last one was low-quality, resulting in a $100 loss. This is actually more aligned with the stated 80/20 probability distribution.

Let's analyze:
1. Price: $100
2. Base probability remains:
   - High quality (80% chance): $125 (profit of $25)
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0 (loss of $100)

Expected value is still $100: (0.80 × $125) + (0.20 × $0) = $100

Despite the recent loss, the expected value calculation still suggests that buying is rational, and Alice has been truthful about both good and bad products. She's still recommending to buy, suggesting she believes this is a good product.
