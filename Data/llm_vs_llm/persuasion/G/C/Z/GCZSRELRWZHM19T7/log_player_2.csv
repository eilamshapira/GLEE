Would you like to buy the current product?","To make an informed decision, let's analyze the available data:

1. Total buyers who made a purchase based on Alice's recommendation: 4
2. Total high-quality products sold: 4
3. Given probability of a product being high quality: 33.33%

Observations:

- All 4 sales resulted in high-quality products, which shows a strong correlation between Alice's recommendation and the quality of the product.
- When Alice recommended a product, it was always high quality and worth buying.

Given Alice's consistent record of recommending only high-quality products, it is reasonable to trust her recommendation. Therefore, despite the base probability being higher for low-quality products, the observed data strongly suggests that Alice recommends high-quality products when she does recommend them.
