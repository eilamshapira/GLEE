"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation logically. Alice is recommending that I buy the product, but I don't know if it's high or low quality.

The expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 50% chance it's worth $400, 50% chance it's worth $0
- Expected value = 0.5 × $400 + 0.5 × $0 - $100 (cost) = $200 - $100 = $100

Since the expected value of buying ($100) is positive, it makes economic sense to purchase the product.
