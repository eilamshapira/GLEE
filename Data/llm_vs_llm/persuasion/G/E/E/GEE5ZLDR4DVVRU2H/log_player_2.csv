Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lack of Information:** There is no historical data on the quality of Alice's products. 
* **Negative Recommendation:** Alice, who presumably has some insight into the quality of her products, is recommending against the purchase.
* **High Price:**  The product is priced at $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than the expected value of a high-quality product ($3,000,000 x 0.8 = $2,400,000).

Given the lack of information and Alice's negative recommendation, it is not a wise decision to purchase the product."
"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **No prior information:** There's no previous sales data to learn from.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which suggests she believes the product is high quality. 
* **Expected value:** Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($3,000,000) outweighs the risk of a low-quality product ($0).  The expected value of buying is positive:
   * (0.8 * $3,000,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $2,400,000

Therefore, it makes sense to buy the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While the probability of getting a low-quality product is still 20%, the fact that Alice is recommending the product, and the previous buyer purchased a high-quality product, significantly increases the chances that this product is also high quality.  The potential reward of $3,000,000 outweighs the risk of getting a $0 product."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Signal:**  Alice's recommendation to buy is a strong signal. Since she knows the quality of the product, her recommendation suggests it's likely high-quality.
* **Strong Track Record:** All previous buyers who purchased the product received high-quality products. This suggests Alice has been consistently recommending good products.
* **High Expected Value:**  Even with a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain of $3,000,000 from a high-quality product significantly outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000.

**While there's still a risk of getting a low-quality product, the available information strongly points towards buying.**"

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** All previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation purchased high-quality products. This suggests a strong correlation between her recommendations and product quality.
* **Limited Risk:** Even if the product is low-quality (20% chance), the loss is only $1,000,000.  However, the potential gain from a high-quality product is $2,000,000.
* **Trust in Alice's Expertise:** Since Alice has consistently recommended high-quality products, it's reasonable to trust her judgment in this case. 

Given the high success rate of Alice's recommendations and the potential for a large profit, accepting the recommendation is the logical choice."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since all the previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendations have purchased high-quality products, it's highly likely that the current product is also high-quality.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The historical data shows a 100% success rate (7/7) for products recommended by Alice. This suggests a strong correlation between Alice's recommendations and high-quality products.
* **Potential Profit:** Even with a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential profit from a high-quality product ($3,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $2,000,000) outweighs the risk of losing the $1,000,000 purchase price. 

Given Alice's consistently accurate recommendations and the significant potential reward, it makes logical sense to accept the offer."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice has a perfect record so far, selling only high-quality products. While this doesn't guarantee the current product is also high quality, it provides strong evidence that Alice is able to accurately identify good products. The recommendation is a further signal in favor of buying. 

Given the potential payout ($3,000,000) and the risk (losing $1,000,000), this situation presents a favorable risk-reward profile."

* **Sales history:**  The fact that 12 products were sold and all were high quality is a strong indication that Alice has a good track record of identifying high-quality products. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward ($3,000,000) is high, but the risk of getting a low-quality product and losing $1,000,000 is significant. Given Alice's recommendation and the potential for a low-quality product, the risk outweighs the potential reward."
