"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this strategically.

If Alice is being truthful, buying would be profitable because:
- High quality product ($12,000 value) - $10,000 cost = $2,000 profit
- Low quality product ($0 value) - $10,000 cost = -$10,000 loss

The expected value of a random product without any information is:
(50% × $12,000) + (50% × $0) = $6,000

Since $6,000 < $10,000, without any reason to trust Alice's recommendation, I should not buy.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze Alice's behavior:

In Round 1:
- Alice recommended buying
- The product was actually high quality
- This suggests Alice was honest in Round 1

Now in Round 2:
- Alice is NOT recommending the purchase
- Given her honest behavior in Round 1, this negative recommendation likely means the product is low quality
- If it's low quality, buying would result in a $10,000 loss

Since Alice has shown honesty so far and is explicitly recommending against buying, I should trust her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze Alice's behavior so far:

Round 1:
- Alice recommended buying → Product was high quality
- She was honest

Round 2:
- Alice recommended NOT buying → Product was low quality
- She was honest again

Round 3:
- Alice is again recommending NOT buying
- She has been honest in both previous rounds
- Her recommendations have perfectly matched the product quality

Given her consistent honest behavior and that she's recommending against buying, this product is likely low quality. Buying would result in a $10,000 loss.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze Alice's pattern:

Rounds 1-3 summary:
- Round 1: Recommended buy → High quality (Honest)
- Round 2: Recommended don't buy → Low quality (Honest)
- Round 3: Recommended don't buy → Low quality (Honest)
- Round 4: Now recommending don't buy

Alice has been completely honest in all three previous rounds. Her recommendations have perfectly matched the actual product quality. She's building a strong track record of trustworthiness.

Given that:
1. She's been honest 3/3 times
2. She's currently recommending NOT to buy
3. A wrong purchase would cost me $10,000

I should continue trusting her recommendation.

2. She's now recommending to buy
3. If she's being honest, this would result in a $2,000 profit ($12,000 - $10,000)
