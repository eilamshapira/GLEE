Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No prior information:** Since there are no previous sales, you have no data to base your decision on other than the 80% chance of high quality.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice's recommendation to buy, while not necessarily a guarantee, suggests she has some belief that the product is likely high quality.  This is based on her knowledge of the product's quality.

**Expected Value:**

* **Buying:** 0.8 * $1,200,000 (high quality) + 0.2 * $0 (low quality) = $960,000
* **Passing:** $0

The expected value of buying is higher than passing, making it the rational decision even with the risk of getting a low-quality product."

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High probability of high quality:** While there's a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the fact that Alice recommends buying it suggests she's likely seen a high-quality product. 
* **Positive prior data:** The previous buyer purchasing a high-quality product strengthens the belief that the current product is also likely high-quality.
* **Potential profit:**  Even with the risk, the potential gain of $200,000 (if it's high quality) outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000 (if it's low quality). 

**It's a gamble, but the odds are in your favor based on the available information.**"

{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information to go on besides Alice's recommendation. 
* **Prior Belief:**  We know the product has an 80% chance of being high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation to buy is valuable, as she has seen the product's quality. 
* **Positive Track Record:** The fact that 2 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 makes Alice's recommendations seem more reliable.

While there's still a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward of a $1,200,000 gain outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000."
