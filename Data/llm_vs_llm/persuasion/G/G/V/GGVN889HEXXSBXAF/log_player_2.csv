Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the statistics, Alice recommended a product to one buyer, but no high-quality products have been sold. This could imply that either the previous buyer made a bad choice, or Alice recommended a low-quality product. Considering the probability of the quality and the price, it's safer to decline, given no high-quality product purchase history.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the situation:

- 1 product has been purchased so far, and it was not high quality.
- Alice recommends buying the product.
- You know that Alice only sells high-quality products once a buyer decides to purchase, making it suspicious that no high-quality products have been sold yet.

This raises doubts about the true quality of the product being offered to you. With these considerations, the safest decision would be not to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the situation, Alice's single sale resulted in a low-quality product being sold since no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that Alice might recommend buying products even if they are low quality. However, based on the recommendation and the probability of receiving a high-quality product, here's the decision:

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the statistics:

- 1 product has been sold by Alice and it was of low quality.
- Alice recommends buying this product.
- The product is potentially high quality but has generally been low quality so far.

Given that Alice's recommendation led to a low-quality purchase previously, there might be some skepticism about this recommendation.

However, since the average value of a randomly selected product ($40) is greater than $0, there could be some value in risking a purchase, provided you weigh the history carefully. In this instance, I'll choose a cautious approach.
