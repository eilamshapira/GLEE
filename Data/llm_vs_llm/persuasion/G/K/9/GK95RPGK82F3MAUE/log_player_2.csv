Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No prior information:** Since there are no previous sales, we have no information about the seller's tendency to offer high or low-quality products. 
* **Alice's recommendation:**  While Alice knows the quality of the product, she has an incentive to recommend buying to maximize her profit. However, we have no reason to doubt her honesty in this scenario. 
* **Expected Value:**  The expected value of buying is (0.5 * $12,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $6,000. The expected value of passing is $0. Since the expected value of buying is higher, it makes sense to buy.

**In summary:**  While there's a risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of getting a high-quality product outweighs the risk, based on the information available."

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which suggests the product is likely high-quality. Since she knows the true quality, her recommendation holds weight.
* **Past Data:** The past data shows that the only product sold so far was high-quality.  While a small sample size, it strengthens the likelihood of the current product being high-quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even if the product is low-quality, the worst-case scenario is losing $10,000. However, the potential gain of $2,000 (if it's high-quality) outweighs the risk, especially with the positive signals from Alice and the past data."

~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a valuable piece of information. Since she knows the true quality of the product and has a strong incentive to sell (she gets paid regardless), her not recommending the product strongly suggests it's low quality.  The previous sales data also supports this: 100% of the products sold so far were high quality.  

Given this information, it's highly probable that the product offered is low quality, making it a risky purchase.  It's better to pass and avoid the potential loss."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. This is valuable information because Alice knows the product's true quality and is incentivized to make recommendations that lead to sales.
* **Sales history:**  Two previous buyers have purchased products, and both were high quality. This suggests a higher-than-average chance of the current product also being high quality. 

While there's still a 50% chance of the product being low quality, the positive signals from Alice's recommendation and the sales history outweigh the risk.  The potential gain ($12,000) is significantly higher than the potential loss ($0)."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice is incentivized to recommend only high-quality products (because she knows your valuation), and she recommends you to buy, there's a strong likelihood the product is high quality.  The fact that all previous buyers who were recommended to buy, purchased the products and turned out to be high quality further strengthens this belief. 

While there's still a 50% chance the product is low quality, the information available heavily favors purchasing the product."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's track record is perfect:**  All 4 previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation received high-quality products. 
* **Alice knows the quality:**  Alice knows the quality of the product she's offering you, and she's recommending you buy it. This suggests she knows it's a high-quality product.

Given this information, it's highly likely the product is high-quality, making it a good investment."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has a perfect track record so far, recommending only high-quality products. Since the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, it's likely Alice is aware of the product's quality and is recommending it because it's high-quality.  While there's still a risk, the odds are in our favor given Alice's success rate."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since all 6 previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation received a high-quality product, it's highly likely that Alice is recommending high-quality products. Given the 50/50 chance of a product being high or low quality, and the perfect track record so far, the odds are strongly in favor of this product being high quality.  The potential reward of $12,000 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000."

{""decision"": ""yes""}

**Explanation:**

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's track record is perfect: 8/8 products sold were high quality.
* Alice is not recommending the product, suggesting it is low quality. 
* The potential payoff for a high-quality product is significant ($12,000), but the risk of getting a low-quality product is also high ($0 value). 
* Given Alice's perfect track record and her specific recommendation against buying, it's highly likely the product is low quality.  
* It's not worth the risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality product."

* **Recommendation:** Alice is recommending you to buy, which suggests she knows this product is high quality.
* **Risk/Reward:**  Even though there's a 50% chance of a product being low quality, the potential reward of $12,000 outweighs the risk of $0.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Track Record:** Alice has a 100% success rate in recommending high-quality products. This is a strong indicator that she is being truthful.
* **Your Expected Value:**  You have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $12,000 and a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product worth $0. This means your expected value is (0.5 * $12,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $6,000.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Passing on the product means you forgo the potential $6,000 in expected value.

Given Alice's perfect record and the positive expected value, it is highly beneficial to buy the product."
