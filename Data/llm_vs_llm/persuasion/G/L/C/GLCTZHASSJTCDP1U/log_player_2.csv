1. Expected Value Calculation:
* High quality (80% chance): $2,000,000 × 0.80 = $1,600,000
* Low quality (20% chance): $0 × 0.20 = $0
* Total expected value = $1,600,000

2. Cost of product: $1,000,000

3. Expected profit = Expected Value - Cost
= $1,600,000 - $1,000,000 = $600,000

Since the expected profit is positive ($600,000) and Alice recommends buying the product, this seems like a good investment opportunity.

3. Additional information:
   * Alice's previous sale was a high-quality product
   * Alice is recommending this product
   * The expected value ($1,600,000) is significantly higher than the price ($1,000,000)

Given that the expected value is higher than the price, Alice's track record shows honesty (1/1 high quality), and she's recommending the purchase, this appears to be a good deal.
