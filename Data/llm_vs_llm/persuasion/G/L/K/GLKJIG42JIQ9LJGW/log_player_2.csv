Alice's message: This product is guaranteed to be high-quality.  I'm offering it for $1000000. Given the 80% prior probability of a high-quality product, this is an excellent deal if a high-quality product is worth significantly more than $1250000 to you (since 0.8 * $1250000 = $1000000). Consider purchasing!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Value calculation:
- High quality (80% chance): $4,000,000
- Low quality (20% chance): $0
- Expected value = (0.8 × $4,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $3,200,000

2. Cost:
- Fixed price: $1,000,000

3. Expected profit:
- Expected profit = Expected value - Cost
- $3,200,000 - $1,000,000 = $2,200,000

Since the expected profit is positive and significant ($2,200,000), it's rational to make the purchase.

Alice's message: I've sold one product so far, and it was high-quality. This current product is also guaranteed to be high-quality. I'm asking $1000000.  Given my perfect track record so far, this offers strong evidence that purchasing from me is a good investment if a high-quality product is worth substantially more than $1000000 to you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected Value calculation:
- High quality (80% chance): 0.8 × $4,000,000 = $3,200,000
- Low quality (20% chance): 0.2 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $3,200,000

2. Cost = $1,000,000

3. Additional information:
- Alice has sold 1 product so far, which was high quality
- Alice claims current product is ""guaranteed"" high quality
- While positive, one successful sale is a small sample size

4. Decision factors:
- Expected value ($3,200,000) significantly exceeds cost ($1,000,000)
- Base probability of high quality (80%) is favorable
- Previous track record is positive, though limited
- Risk is manageable as potential gain ($3M) outweighs potential loss ($1M)

Given the favorable expected value and positive indicators, buying is rational.

For $1000000, you have the opportunity to acquire a product with a proven track record of excellence. This is a strong signal of quality; consider the value of a high-quality product to you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Past performance:
- 2 buyers so far, both bought
- Both products were high quality
- Success rate: 100%

2. Current situation:
- Alice guarantees this product is high quality
- If high quality, value to me: $4,000,000
- Cost: $1,000,000
- Potential profit if high quality: $3,000,000
- Loss if low quality: $1,000,000

3. Credibility:
- Alice's track record shows honesty (2/2 high quality)
- Direct guarantee about current product quality

Given:
- The strong track record
- Alice's explicit guarantee
- The favorable expected value ($4M value vs $1M cost)
- Zero low-quality products sold so far

The risk-reward ratio appears favorable, and Alice's credibility is backed by data.

Alice's message: While my previous three products were all high-quality, remember the overall likelihood of a high-quality product is 80%.  I am still asking $1000000 for this product.  Even if this one is not high-quality, my strong track record suggests future purchases will likely be high-quality.  Consider the potential long-term value if you intend to purchase multiple times.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected Value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($4,000,000) = $3,200,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $3,200,000

2. Cost of product = $1,000,000

3. Additional considerations:
- All 3 previous sales were high quality
- Alice's message appears to be hedging, suggesting this one might not be high quality
- The message seems to be shifting focus to future purchases rather than the current one

4. Decision point:
- Despite the expected value being positive ($3,200,000 > $1,000,000)
- Alice's cryptic message raises some red flags
- The perfect track record combined with a cautionary message suggests this might be a low-quality product

Alice's message: Three out of the four products I've sold have been high-quality. I'm asking $1000000 for this product. While the previous buyer chose not to purchase, the overall high quality rate still suggests good odds of obtaining a valuable product.  Consider the potential upside if this product is high-quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected Value Calculation:
* 80% chance of high quality: 0.8 × $4,000,000 = $3,200,000
* 20% chance of low quality: 0.2 × $0 = $0

3. Net Expected Value:
* $3,200,000 - $1,000,000 = $2,200,000

4. Additional Considerations:
* The track record shows 3 high-quality products sold
* The 80% probability matches the actual observed success rate
* The price is significantly lower than the potential value of a high-quality product

Since the expected value ($3,200,000) is more than three times the cost ($1,000,000), and the seller's track record supports the stated probabilities, this is a positive expected value decision.

1. Historical data:
- 7 buyers purchased products
