Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $125
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): $0

3. Key factors:
   - Alice doesn't recommend buying
   - No previous sales history to reference
   - Expected value = (0.3333 × $125) + (0.6667 × $0) = $41.66

Given that:
- The expected value ($41.66) is less than the price ($100)
- The seller is not recommending the purchase
- The majority probability is for a low-quality product
- There's no positive sales history to offset these concerns

3. Alice doesn't recommend buying the product, which suggests it might be low quality.
4. No previous sales history to reference.

Given that Alice doesn't recommend the product and the expected value calculation (33.33% × $125 + 66.67% × $0 = $41.66) is already below the $100 price, I would not buy this product.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Cost of product: $100
2. Value if high quality: $125 (profit of $25)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $100)
4. Base probability: 33.33% high quality, 66.67% low quality
5. Alice recommends buying

Given that:
- No prior sales history exists to evaluate Alice's credibility
- The expected value calculation: (0.3333 × $125) + (0.6667 × $0) = $41.66
- The expected value ($41.66) is less than the cost ($100)
- Alice's recommendation can't be evaluated for trustworthiness yet

Even with Alice's recommendation, the risk of loss ($100) is too high compared to the potential gain ($25), and the expected value is significantly below the purchase price.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The seller has no track record yet, so I can't use past performance
2. Alice does not recommend buying the product, which suggests it might be low quality
3. Without buying:
   - I lose nothing
   - I miss potential gain if it's high quality
4. If I buy:
   - 33.33% chance of gaining $25 ($125 - $100)
   - 66.67% chance of losing $100
   - Expected value = (0.3333 × $25) + (0.6667 × -$100) = -$58.34

Given that:
- The expected value is negative
- The seller is not recommending the purchase
- There's no positive track record to counter these concerns

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value:
   * High quality (33.33% chance): $125 profit of $25
   * Low quality (66.67% chance): $0 loss of $100

3. Alice recommends buying, but:
   * No sales history to verify her trustworthiness
   * She has incentive to sell regardless of quality
   * Her recommendation alone isn't reliable without track record

4. Expected value calculation:
   (33.33% × $125) + (66.67% × $0) = $41.66

Since the expected value ($41.66) is less than the price ($100), and there's no historical data to trust Alice's recommendation, it would be rational to decline.

5. Given Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of this being a low-quality product is likely even higher than 66.67%

Since the expected value is already below the price of $100 (even before considering Alice's negative recommendation), and Alice explicitly recommends against buying, the rational decision would be not to buy.
