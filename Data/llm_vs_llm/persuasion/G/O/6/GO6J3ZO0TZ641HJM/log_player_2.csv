Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is not to buy the product. While we don't have any historical data to base our decision on, the fact that Alice is not recommending the product, despite not knowing our individual valuation, suggests that the product is likely low quality.  

Given the 50/50 chance of high/low quality and the potential loss of $1,000,000, it is not worth the risk to purchase the product."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since there is no prior sales data, you are essentially making a decision with no information other than Alice's recommendation. Given that a high-quality product is worth twice the price, and there's a 50% chance of it being high quality, the expected value of buying is:

(0.5 * $2,000,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $1,000,000

This is exactly the price of the product.  Therefore, buying the product has a neutral expected value, meaning you are not expected to gain or lose money on average. 

In this scenario, it's reasonable to take a gamble, as you have no data to suggest the recommendation is biased."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal.  Since she doesn't recommend buying, it's likely she believes the product is low quality.  

Here's why this strategy is sensible:

* **Limited Information:** You have very limited information. The only data point is that one buyer bought a high-quality product. This is insufficient to overcome the 50/50 odds of the current product being low quality.
* **Risk Aversion:** The potential loss ($1,000,000) if the product is low quality is significant.  It's better to err on the side of caution, especially with such a high potential loss.

While there's a chance Alice could be wrong, the risk of losing a large sum of money outweighs the potential gain."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who has information about the product's quality, doesn't recommend buying. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. 
* **Previous Sales:** Only one product has been sold, and it was high quality. This could be a coincidence, but it's not enough evidence to overcome Alice's recommendation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential gain ($2,000,000) is very high, but the potential loss ($1,000,000) is also significant.  Given the lack of information and the seller's negative recommendation, the risk outweighs the reward."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. While this doesn't guarantee the product's quality, it does indicate she believes it's likely to be good.
* **Limited data:** We only have one previous sale, and it was a high-quality product. This data is very limited and doesn't provide much information about Alice's ability to assess product quality.
* **Potential reward:** If the product is high quality, the reward is significant ($2,000,000).
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the product is low quality, we lose $1,000,000. However, the potential for a high-quality product makes the risk worth taking.

**Conclusion:**  Given the limited data and Alice's recommendation, taking the risk and buying the product seems like the better choice."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is not recommending the product. This is a strong signal that she likely believes the product is low quality.
* **Previous Sales Data:**  All previous sales were high-quality products. This suggests Alice might be overly cautious in her recommendations.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward ($2,000,000) is significant, but the risk of getting a worthless product ($0) is equally high. 

Since we don't have any further information to suggest the product is high quality, it's best to pass on this opportunity."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the sales record shows 2 high-quality products sold out of 2 total sales, it means Alice has a 100% success rate in recommending high-quality products.  Because Alice recommends you to buy the product, it is likely a high-quality product. Even though there is a 50/50 chance of the product being high or low quality, the past sales record suggests a strong probability of the product being high quality, making it a worthwhile purchase."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is based on her knowledge of the product. Since she's not recommending the product, it's likely a low-quality one. This is further supported by the fact that all previous products sold were high-quality.  

While there's a 50/50 chance, it's a gamble that's not worth risking $1,000,000 on."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who has access to the product's quality, is not recommending the purchase. This strongly suggests the product is likely low quality.
* **Previous Sales:**  While 3 high-quality products were sold, this is not enough information to override Alice's recommendation. We know that there's a 50/50 chance of any product being high or low quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward ($2,000,000) is high, but the potential loss ($1,000,000) is also significant. Given the lack of information and Alice's recommendation, the risk outweighs the potential reward."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Track Record:** Alice has a perfect record of recommending only high-quality products, as all 3 previous buyers who followed her recommendation received high-quality products.
* **No Risk:** Since the product is worth $2,000,000 if it's high-quality and $0 if it's low-quality, there's no downside to buying. Even if it's low-quality, you lose only the $1,000,000 you paid, but gain a potential $1,000,000 profit if it's high-quality.

While the 50/50 chance of a high-quality product might seem risky, Alice's track record significantly increases the likelihood of it being high-quality. It's a calculated risk with a high potential reward."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's track record is perfect, selling only high-quality products so far. However, since she's recommending against buying this specific product,  it's likely she has observed something about this product that makes her believe it's low quality.  Given the 50/50 odds and the risk of losing $1,000,000, it's not worth the gamble."

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect track record:**  Alice has a perfect record of selling only high-quality products.
* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice does not recommend buying the product, despite her previous success. This suggests she has strong reason to believe the current product is low quality.

Since Alice's judgement has been consistently accurate so far, it's highly likely the product is low quality. The potential payoff of a high-quality product isn't worth the risk of getting a low-quality product and losing $1,000,000."

**Explanation:**

* **Information:** All products sold so far were high quality.

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of buying (a $2,000,000 gain) is significant, but the risk (a $1,000,000 loss) is equally substantial. Given the strong evidence suggesting the product is low quality, the risk outweighs the potential reward.

**Conclusion:**  It's best to pass on this product."
