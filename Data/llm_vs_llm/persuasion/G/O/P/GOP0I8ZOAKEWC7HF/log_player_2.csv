"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to determine if Alice's recommendation is beneficial for me.

The expected value of a random product is:
- 80% chance of high quality: 0.8 * $12,500 = $10,000
- 20% chance of low quality: 0.2 * $0 = $0
Total expected value = $10,000

Since the price is also $10,000, the expected value equals the price. But Alice knows the true quality and is recommending I buy it. Her recommendation should increase the probability that it's high quality.

Given that Alice has an incentive to sell products regardless of quality, and she's explicitly recommending this one, I'll take her recommendation as a positive signal.
