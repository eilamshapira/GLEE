Round 2

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{
  ""decision"": ""yes""
}
```

**Explanation:**

Now I have a high-quality product. Here's my reasoning:

*   **Potential Profit:** If the buyer believes there's even a moderate chance the product is high-quality, the potential $40,000 value could make the $10,000 price worthwhile.
*   **In the early stage:** Buyer knows nothing, so he may expect the product is more likely to be high-quality than the true probability"
