"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given that Alice does not recommend buying the product, I need to consider what this means. Since Alice is a seller trying to make money, her recommendation not to buy suggests the product might be low quality. In this case, her interests and mine are aligned - she's being honest about a product that would likely give me negative expected value.

If the product is low quality (worth $0 to me), I'd lose $1,000,000 by buying it.
If the product is high quality (worth $3,000,000 to me), I'd gain $2,000,000 by buying it.

Since Alice is choosing not to recommend it despite having an incentive to sell, I should trust her recommendation.
