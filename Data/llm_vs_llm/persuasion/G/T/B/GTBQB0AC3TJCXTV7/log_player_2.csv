Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. The price is $10,000
2. If it's high quality (50% chance), I get $12,500 value (+$2,500 profit)
3. If it's low quality (50% chance), I get $0 value (-$10,000 loss)
4. Expected value = (0.5 × $2,500) + (0.5 × -$10,000) = -$3,750
5. Alice knows the true value and does NOT recommend buying
6. Given Alice's knowledge and negative recommendation, the probability of low quality is likely higher than 50%

Since Alice knows the true value and is not recommending the purchase, combined with the negative expected value even with 50-50 odds, I should not buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50%): $12,500
   - Low quality (50%): $0
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $12,500) + (0.5 × $0) = $6,250

Even though Alice recommends buying the product, I have no historical data to assess her trustworthiness. The expected value ($6,250) is less than the price ($10,000), making this a risky purchase with negative expected returns.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $10,000
2. Value if high quality: $12,500 (profit of $2,500)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $10,000)
4. Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
5. Alice recommends buying

Given Alice knows the true value and recommends buying, this could be a positive signal. However:
- There's no track record to validate Alice's trustworthiness
- Expected value without additional information:
  (50% × $12,500) + (50% × $0) = $6,250
  This is less than the $10,000 price

Even with Alice's recommendation, without any track record to establish trust, the potential loss ($10,000) outweighs the potential gain ($2,500) given the probabilities.

3. Expected value = (0.5 × $12,500) + (0.5 × $0) = $6,250

Since I'm the first buyer, I have no historical data to base my decision on. Alice's recommendation to buy is encouraging, but without any track record to establish trust, I need to focus on the pure economics.

The expected value ($6,250) is less than the price ($10,000), making this a negative expected value proposition.

4. Alice's recommendation: Buy
   - However, Alice's incentive is to sell regardless of quality
   - No historical data to assess Alice's honesty

5. Risk assessment:
   - Expected value ($6,250) is less than price ($10,000)
   - 50% chance of losing entire investment
   - No track record to build trust

Given that the expected value is lower than the price, and there's no historical data to trust Alice's recommendation, it would be financially unwise to buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The product costs $10,000
2. If it's high quality, I gain $12,500 (profit of $2,500)
3. If it's low quality, I gain $0 (loss of $10,000)
4. Alice knows the true value and doesn't recommend buying
5. Alice has no established track record yet

Given that Alice has knowledge of the true quality and is actively recommending against the purchase, this suggests the product is likely low quality. While Alice's incentives aren't completely clear without a track record, it's safer to trust the negative recommendation in this case.

The expected value ($6,250) is less than the price ($10,000), which would make this a bad deal on average. However, Alice knows the true quality and is recommending to buy.

If Alice is being honest, this suggests the product is high quality ($12,500 value), making it profitable to buy. But since there's no track record yet to establish Alice's credibility, this is risky.

Given the lack of historical data and the significant potential loss ($10,000) if the product is low quality, the prudent choice is to decline.

The expected value without considering Alice's recommendation:
- 50% chance of $12,500 + 50% chance of $0 = $6,250
This is less than the $10,000 cost.

However, Alice knows the true quality and is recommending to buy. If she's being honest, this suggests it's high quality. But since there's no track record to evaluate her trustworthiness, it's risky to rely solely on her recommendation.

Given the significant potential loss ($10,000) compared to the potential gain ($2,500), and no historical data to trust Alice's recommendation, it's too risky.
