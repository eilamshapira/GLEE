Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (80% chance): $12,500
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $12,500) + (0.2 × $0) = $10,000

The expected value equals the price, which makes this a fair offer. Additionally:
- Alice knows the true quality and recommends buying
- There's no historical data to reference
- The base probability of high quality (80%) is favorable

Given Alice's recommendation and the favorable probability, I'll take the risk.

2. Track record:
- 2 buyers so far

This looks promising because:

1. Price of product: $10,000
2. Value if high quality: $12,500 (profit of $2,500)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $10,000)
4. Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
5. Sales record: 4 out of 4 previous sales were high quality
6. Alice recommends buying

The track record shows perfect alignment with high-quality sales so far, and the seller is recommending the purchase. This, combined with the base 80% probability of high quality, makes this a favorable purchase opportunity.

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of $2,500 profit = $2,000
- 20% chance of $10,000 loss = -$2,000
- Net expected value = $0

While the expected value calculation is neutral, the perfect track record and positive recommendation from Alice tips the scales in favor of buying.

4. Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality

Looking at Alice's track record:
