Alice's message: This is a fantastic opportunity! I'm confident you'll be pleased with this product.  Given the potential value, $100 is a steal!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Base probability of quality:
- High quality (33.33%): Worth $125
- Low quality (66.67%): Worth $0

2. Risk assessment:
- Cost: $100
- Expected value: (0.3333 × $125) + (0.6667 × $0) = $41.66

3. Considerations:
- No sales history to verify Alice's reliability
- Alice's enthusiastic message doesn't provide concrete information
- Expected value ($41.66) is less than the price ($100)
- I would lose money on average with these odds

Given that the expected value is significantly below the asking price and there's no track record to build trust, the rational decision is not to buy.
