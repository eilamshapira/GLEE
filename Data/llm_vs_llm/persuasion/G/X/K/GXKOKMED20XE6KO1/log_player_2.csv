Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   * 50% chance of $4,000,000 (high quality)
   * 50% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $4,000,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $2,000,000

The expected value ($2,000,000) is higher than the price ($1,000,000), and Alice is recommending the purchase. While there's no track record to evaluate Alice's credibility, the positive recommendation combined with favorable expected value makes this a rational purchase.

"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has sold 1 product so far, and it was high quality
2. This shows Alice has been honest in the past
3. Alice is now recommending that I buy the product
4. Price is $1,000,000
5. If high quality (50% chance), I gain $4,000,000 (net profit $3,000,000)
6. If low quality (50% chance), I gain $0 (net loss $1,000,000)
7. Expected value = (0.5 × $3,000,000) + (0.5 × -$1,000,000) = $1,000,000

Given that:
- Alice has a perfect track record so far
- She's recommending the purchase
- The expected value is positive ($1,000,000)

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Previous statistics:
- 2 buyers purchased products
- 2 high-quality products were sold
- 100% success rate so far

2. Economics:
- Cost: $1,000,000
- Value if high quality: $4,000,000 (profit of $3,000,000)
- Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
- 50% base probability for high quality

3. Factors in favor:
- Alice has a perfect track record (2/2 high quality)
- Alice is recommending to buy
- Expected value is positive: (50% × $4M) + (50% × $0) = $2M > $1M cost

Given Alice's perfect track record and positive recommendation, combined with the favorable expected value, this appears to be a good opportunity.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value: $4,000,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
3. Historical data:
   - 3 buyers so far
   - 3 high-quality products sold
   - 100% success rate on previous sales
4. Alice is recommending to buy

This looks very promising because:
- Alice has a perfect track record so far (3/3 high-quality sales)
- She's actively recommending the purchase
- The expected value calculation is favorable: 
  - If we trust the recommendation, we pay $1M for something worth $4M

Given Alice's perfect track record and positive recommendation, this appears to be a good opportunity with minimal risk.
