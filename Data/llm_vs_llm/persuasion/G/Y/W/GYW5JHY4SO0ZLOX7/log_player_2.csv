Alice's message: Welcome! This is my first product for sale. I'm offering it to you for $100. I don't have any previous sales history, but I assure you that the product is being sold as is. If you're interested, please buy it, and you'll discover its quality after purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Without any previous sales history or information about the quality of the current product, I need to evaluate this based on the expected value.

For this product:
- 50% chance it's high quality (worth $300)
- 50% chance it's low quality (worth $0)
- Cost is $100

Expected value = (0.5 × $300) + (0.5 × $0) = $150

Since the expected value ($150) is greater than the cost ($100), it makes statistical sense to buy the product.

Alice's message: Welcome! I've sold one product so far, and I'm offering this new one to you for $100. I want to be transparent that my previous product's quality was not disclosed, but I can tell you that this new product is of a different quality than the previous one. Consider this information when making your decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Alice has sold one product so far, but the quality of that product hasn't been disclosed. She does tell me that this new product is of a different quality than the previous one.

If the previous product was high quality, then this one must be low quality (worth $0 to me).
If the previous product was low quality, then this one must be high quality (worth $300 to me).

Given that there's a 50% chance for each quality type initially, and I don't know the quality of the previous sold product, I still have a 50% chance of this product being high quality. If it's high quality, my expected value would be $300 - $100 = $200. If it's low quality, I'd lose $100.

My expected value is: 0.5 × $200 + 0.5 × (-$100) = $100 + (-$50) = $50

Since the expected value is positive, it's rational to purchase.

Alice's message: Welcome! I've sold two products so far. I can confirm that one of them was of high quality, and the other was not. This new product I'm offering to you for $100 has a quality that might interest you, but I won't disclose it yet. Keep in mind that my high-quality product was sold in the previous round, and consider that when making your decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, I need to assess whether buying the product for $100 is a good decision.

I know that:
- Each product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $300) or low quality (worth $0)
- Alice has sold 2 products, with 1 being high quality
- Alice mentions her high-quality product was sold in the previous round
- The expected value of a random product is: (0.5 × $300) + (0.5 × $0) = $150

Since the expected value ($150) exceeds the cost ($100), and there's no clear indication that this specific product is low quality, it seems like a rational decision to purchase.

Alice's message: Welcome! I've sold three products so far, with one of them being high-quality and the other two not. I'm offering this new product to you for $100. Given my previous sales history, you might want to consider the odds of this product's quality before making a decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze if buying this product is a good decision.

Facts:
- Product costs $100
- High-quality product is worth $300 to me
- Low-quality product is worth $0 to me
- Products have a 50% chance of being high or low quality
- Alice has sold 3 products, with only 1 being high-quality (33.3%)

Expected value calculation:
If I assume the 50% base probability:
EV = (0.5 × $300) + (0.5 × $0) - $100 = $150 - $100 = $50

However, Alice's track record shows only 1/3 of products sold were high quality. This suggests the probability might be lower than 50%, which would make the expected value potentially negative.

Given the limited information and Alice's poor track record so far, I'll decline this offer.

My last two buyers chose not to purchase, but I'm offering this new product to you for $100. I want to highlight that my last two unsold products might have changed the odds of what you can expect from me. Consider the possibility that I might be due for a sale of a high-quality product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to carefully evaluate if this purchase is worth it.

The product costs $100. If it's high quality, it's worth $300 to me (profit of $200). If it's low quality, it's worth $0 (loss of $100).

From the sales record:
- 3 buyers purchased products
- Only 1 high-quality product was sold
- This means 2 low-quality products were sold

Given the 50/50 chance of high vs low quality, and the fact that previous sales have included more low quality products, there's no clear statistical advantage here. Alice's message attempts to suggest I'm ""due"" for a high-quality product, but that's the gambler's fallacy - each product's quality is independent.

The expected value is: 0.5 × ($300-$100) + 0.5 × ($0-$100) = $50, which is positive but not compelling given the record.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this carefully:

- If high quality, I gain $300 - $100 = $200
- If low quality, I lose $100
- Expected value: 0.5 × $200 + 0.5 × (-$100) = $50, which is positive

Alice's record shows she's sold 3 products, with only 1 being high quality (33%). However, past outcomes don't influence the quality of my current product, which remains at 50% probability of being high quality.

Alice's message contains potentially misleading information - claiming ""three consecutive high-quality products that didn't sell,"" but this contradicts her sales record. The probability of the current product being high quality is still 50%.

Alice has sold 4 products, with 2 being high-quality (worth $300) and 2 being low-quality (worth $0).

While Alice mentions her last unsold product was likely lower quality, she doesn't explicitly state the quality of the current product being offered to me. With no specific information about the current product's quality, I should rely on the base probability (50% high-quality, 50% low-quality).

If I buy, my expected value is: 0.5 × $300 + 0.5 × $0 = $150
The cost is $100, so the expected profit is $150 - $100 = $50.

Since the expected value exceeds the cost, it's rational to purchase.

Alice claims she has sold 5 products with 2 being high-quality. However, the statistics show ""5 of the buyers purchased the products"" and ""2 high-quality product have been sold."" This suggests all 5 purchased products were sold, with 2 being high-quality and 3 being low-quality.

Alice also mentions ""my last high-quality offering didn't sell"" and ""two consecutive high-quality products that didn't sell,"" which is inconsistent with the information that all recommended products were purchased.

Given these inconsistencies and that there's still only a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product (worth $300) or a low-quality product (worth $0), the expected value is:
0.5 × $300 + 0.5 × $0 = $150

Alice states she has sold 6 products, with 3 high-quality ones. She claims the last few offerings were high quality (including one that sold and two that didn't sell). However, I should focus on the objective information - the overall sales record shows a 50% rate of high-quality products sold, which aligns with the stated 50% probability in the game rules.

With a 50% chance of high quality:
Expected value = 0.5 × $300 + 0.5 × $0 - $100 = $150 - $100 = $50

- 4 high-quality products have been sold

Alice's message suggests this product might be of lower quality. She mentions her streak of high-quality products might be ending, which sounds like a warning.

The expected value calculation:
- If probability of high quality is 0.5: ($300 × 0.5) + ($0 × 0.5) - $100 = $50
- This would make buying profitable on average

The expected value calculation is:
- 50% chance of high quality: 0.5 × $300 = $150
