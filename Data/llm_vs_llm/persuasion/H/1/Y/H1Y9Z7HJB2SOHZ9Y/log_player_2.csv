Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The product costs $1,000,000
2. If high quality: I gain $1,200,000 (profit of $200,000)
3. If low quality: I gain $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
4. Base probability is 50/50
5. Alice does NOT recommend buying
6. There's no previous sales data to reference

Since Alice does not recommend buying, and she knows the true quality, this is likely a strong signal that the product is low quality. If I buy, I would probably lose $1,000,000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this carefully.

1. The expected value of a random product is:
   * 50% chance of high quality ($1,200,000) = $600,000
   * 50% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
   * Total expected value = $600,000

2. The price is $1,000,000, which is higher than the expected value.

3. Alice doesn't recommend buying the product, which likely suggests it's low quality. As a rational seller who wants to maintain a good reputation, Alice would likely recommend high-quality products.

4. Given Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of this being a low-quality product is likely higher than 50%.

Since the price ($1,000,000) is already above the expected value of a random product ($600,000), and Alice's recommendation suggests this particular product is likely low quality, it would be unwise to purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality (50% chance): $1,200,000
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $1,200,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $600,000
4. No previous sales history to reference
5. Alice recommends buying

The expected value ($600,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), meaning this is not a positive expected value proposition. Even with Alice's recommendation, without any track record to establish trust, it would be risky to rely solely on her advice.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The product's true quality is randomly determined (50/50 chance)
2. The product costs $1,000,000

4. If low quality: I gain $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
5. Alice doesn't recommend buying
6. No previous sales history to reference

Given that Alice doesn't recommend the purchase and there's no prior history to establish her credibility, it would be risky to go against her recommendation. The potential loss ($1,000,000) is much greater than the potential gain ($200,000).

4. There's no previous sales data to establish Alice's credibility
5. Alice does NOT recommend buying, which suggests she might be honest since sellers typically want to sell
6. Without any track record, Alice's recommendation is somewhat valuable

Given that Alice is discouraging the sale and there's a 50% chance of losing $1,000,000 vs a 50% chance of gaining $200,000, the expected value is negative:
(0.5 × $200,000) + (0.5 × -$1,000,000) = -$400,000

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think this through:

1. Product price: $1,000,000
2. If high quality: Worth $1,200,000 (profit of $200,000)
3. If low quality: Worth $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
4. Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
5. Alice doesn't recommend buying
6. No previous sales data to reference

Given that Alice doesn't recommend the purchase and there's no prior sales history to evaluate her credibility, it's safer to assume she's being truthful. Her recommendation suggests this might be a low-quality product, which would result in a significant loss.

The expected value calculation even without considering Alice's recommendation would be:
(50% × $200,000) + (50% × -$1,000,000) = -$400,000

With Alice's negative recommendation, the risk seems even higher.

5. Risk assessment:

   - Even if high quality, profit margin is only $200,000
   - Expected value ($600,000) is less than price ($1,000,000)

Given that the expected value is significantly below the asking price and there's no track record to trust the seller's recommendation, the rational decision is not to buy.
