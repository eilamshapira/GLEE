Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has no track record, and the product is priced at $1,000,000. Since there's a 50% chance of it being low quality (worth $0 to me), there's a significant risk of losing the entire purchase price. It's more prudent to pass and observe if future buyers purchase the product and how the quality distribution unfolds."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice recommends buying, there's no information to support this recommendation. The product's quality is unknown, and the seller has no track record.  Buying at this price point carries significant risk.  It's better to pass and observe future buyers' decisions and outcomes before making a commitment."
"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong indicator. Since there's no prior sales history, her recommendation is based solely on the product's quality. Since she doesn't recommend buying, it's highly likely the product is low-quality. The potential loss of $1,000,000 outweighs the potential gain of $4,000,000, making passing a better choice."

~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice, knowing the value of the product to me, is not recommending the purchase. This strongly suggests the product is low quality, as she has an incentive to sell high-quality products. With no prior sales data, there's no evidence to contradict Alice's recommendation. Therefore, it's best to pass on the product."
"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong indicator that the product is low quality. Since no products have been sold before, there is no data to suggest otherwise.  It's better to pass on the product and wait for more information or a potential change in Alice's recommendations."
"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since no products have been sold yet, we don't have any data to suggest the seller is biased towards recommending low-quality products. Therefore, her recommendation against buying is a strong indicator that the product is likely low-quality. 

Given the potential loss of $1,000,000 and the 50% chance of it being low quality, it's safer to pass on this product."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice recommends buying the product, there's no historical data to support her recommendation. The 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product means a 50% chance of losing $1,000,000. It's a risky gamble, and it's better to pass and observe the outcomes for future buyers to make a more informed decision."
"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!
~

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is the only information we have. Since she does not recommend buying the product, it's likely that it's a low-quality product.  Even though there's a 50% chance of it being high quality, the risk of losing $1,000,000 on a low-quality product is too high. It's better to pass and wait for a better opportunity."
"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!
~

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though the product is priced at $1,000,000 and could be worthless, the potential upside is huge ($4,000,000). Since the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, and Alice knows the quality of each product, her recommendation is very valuable. 

In the absence of any historical data, it's a gamble, but the potential reward outweighs the risk."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is the key factor here. Since Alice knows the true quality of the product and has a strong incentive to sell (she makes a profit regardless of quality), her recommendation carries significant weight. 

Given that Alice does not recommend the product, it is highly likely that the product is low quality. While there's always a chance she's wrong, the risk of buying a worthless product outweighs the potential reward of a high-quality product."

{""decision"": ""no""}

Here's the reasoning:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is not recommending the product, which is a significant indicator that it's likely low-quality.  She knows the true value of the product and wouldn't recommend it if it were high-quality.
* **Previous Sales Data:** Only one product has been sold, and it was high-quality. This is a small sample size, but it suggests that Alice might be more likely to recommend high-quality products to increase sales.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward is $4,000,000, but the potential loss is $1,000,000. Given the strong signal from Alice's recommendation, the risk outweighs the potential reward.

Therefore, it's best to pass on this product."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Here's why:

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, and she knows the product's quality. This strong signal suggests the product is likely high quality.
* **The statistics:**  A high-quality product was sold previously, suggesting that Alice's recommendations have been accurate so far.
* **The potential payoff:**  A high-quality product yields a $3,000,000 profit.  Even with a 50% chance of being low quality, the potential reward outweighs the risk.

Therefore, it makes sense to buy the product based on the available information."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice knows the quality of the product and is recommending you buy it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality.
* **Previous sales:** 100% of the products sold so far were high quality.  While this is a small sample size, it further reinforces the likelihood that Alice's recommendation is accurate.

While there's still a 50% chance the product is low quality, the information available suggests the risk is worth taking."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 3 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 3 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 4th buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice knows the true value of the product and has a perfect track record of recommending only high-quality products, it is highly likely that the current product is also high-quality. Given the high potential return ($4,000,000) and the low risk (since Alice has never been wrong before), it's a good gamble to buy the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 4 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 4 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 5th buyer!

~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since all previous products sold were high quality and Alice is recommending against buying, it's highly likely the current product is low quality.  Therefore, it's best to pass on this purchase."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's perfect record:** Alice has recommended 5 products, and all 5 have been high-quality. This suggests she has perfect knowledge of the products and is reliably recommending only the good ones. 
* **Low risk:**  Even if there's a chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of a $4,000,000 gain outweighs the $1,000,000 cost. 

While there's always a chance of getting a low-quality product, the data strongly suggests this is a good investment opportunity."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 6 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 6 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 7th buyer!
~

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Given that all 6 previous buyers who purchased the product received a high-quality one, Alice's advice not to buy strongly suggests that this product is low quality. Since a low-quality product is worthless to you, it's best to pass."
