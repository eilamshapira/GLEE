"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a high-stakes game, Bob! I'm offering you a product for $1000000.  I can assure you, with absolute honesty, that *this particular product* is of exceptional quality. This isn't just sales talk; it truly is a top-tier item.  Consider the potential upside here.  Are you willing to take the chance and potentially reap the rewards?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: Bob, another chance for you!  This product is up for grabs for $1000000. This is a bit of a gamble, I'll be honest. I can't vouch for this one being top-of-the-line like the last one. It *could* be amazing, or it *might* not live up to the previous one. Feeling lucky?  High risk, high reward!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes""}"

Round 3
Alice's message: Bob, round three! This product is available for $1000000.  I'm going to be straight with you - this one isn't one of my best. It's a bit of a wildcard. If you're feeling adventurous and have a high tolerance for risk, go for it.  But if you're looking for a sure thing, you might want to sit this one out.

Round 4
Alice's message: Bob, product number four is here for $1000000!  This one is...well, it's a product.  Let's just say I'm being completely transparent when I tell you  I'd probably pass on this one if I were you, unless you're feeling exceptionally lucky today.  Think of it as a lottery ticket, only with a much higher buy-in.

If you skipped the last one, you'll probably want to skip this one too.  Unless, of course, you've developed a sudden fondness for...well, let's just say less-than-stellar products.
