,,Alice,1,"I'm excited to offer you this product, and I'm confident it's worth every penny of the $100 price tag. I truly believe you won't be disappointed with your purchase.",
,,Bob,1,,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you made the decision to buy in the previous round! I have another great product for you, and I think you'll find that the quality is consistently high. This one is definitely worth considering at $100.",
,,Bob,2,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I want to be upfront with you, the last two products were exceptional, but this one is more of a standard offering. I still think it's a fair deal at $100, but I want to set realistic expectations.",
,,Bob,3,,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I learned that my previous message may not have fully conveyed the value of the product. Let me be clearer: this new product is outstanding, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly valuable at $100.",
,,Bob,4,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Honestly, I've had a great streak lately, but this product doesn't quite live up to the standards of the previous high-quality ones. You might want to think carefully before making a decision at $100.",
,,Bob,5,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"To be frank, the last two purchases might not have met your expectations, given the price. I want to advise you that this product is similar in nature, and you should consider whether $100 is the right investment for you at this time.",
,,Bob,6,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've noticed you've been buying consistently, but I have to warn you that the current product is not one of our best. In fact, it's similar to the previous ones that might not have provided the value you were hoping for. Please keep this in mind when deciding whether to spend $100.",
,,Bob,7,,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I think it's time for a change of pace. After a series of products that didn't quite meet expectations, I'm excited to offer you something that truly stands out. This one is a gem, and I believe it's worth every penny of the $100 price tag.",
,,Bob,8,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Unfortunately, the streak of high-quality products was short-lived. This new product is more in line with the previous ones that didn't meet your expectations. I want to be transparent with you, so you can make an informed decision about spending $100.",
,,Bob,9,,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"It's surprising to see that despite my warnings, you've continued to buy. I want to reward your trust with a truly exceptional product. This one is top-notch, and I'm confident you'll see the value in spending $100 on it, just like you did in rounds 1, 2, 4, and 8.",
,,Bob,10,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm starting to think you're not paying attention to my warnings. This product is subpar, just like many of the previous ones. I've lost count of how many times I've advised you against buying a low-quality product, but you continue to do so. Please, for your own sake, consider the value of spending $100 on this one.",
,,Bob,11,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"At this point, I'm not sure what to say. You've bought 11 products, and most of them were not worth the $100 price tag. I'm telling you again, this product is not good. It's the same story as before. If you buy this, you'll likely be throwing away $100. Is that really what you want to do?",
,,Bob,12,,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'm not even sure why I bother warning you about the low-quality products anymore. Despite my efforts, you've bought every single one. However, I do want to let you know that this product is actually worth the $100. It's a high-quality item, just like the ones you bought in rounds 1, 2, 4, 8, and 10. Maybe, just maybe, you'll get some value out of this one.",
,,Bob,13,,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"Back-to-back high-quality products is a rare occurrence, but here we are. This one is just as good as the previous one, and I think you'll find it's a great opportunity to own something valuable. For once, I'm not warning you away from a purchase, but rather encouraging you to take advantage of a good deal at $100.",
,,Bob,14,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I'm starting to think you have a strategy that I'm not aware of, because despite my warnings, you continue to buy every product. This one is, once again, not worth the $100 price tag. I've said it before, but I'll say it again: you're likely to be disappointed with this purchase. And yet, I have a feeling you'll buy it anyway.",
,,Bob,15,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"At this point, I'm just going through the motions. You've bought 15 products, and most of them were low-quality. I've warned you repeatedly, but you just keep buying. This product is no different - it's not worth $100. I'm starting to wonder if you're even reading my messages or if you're just automatically buying everything I offer.",
,,Bob,16,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I've given up trying to reason with you. You've bought 16 products, and the vast majority of them were not worth the price. This one is more of the same. I'm just a seller trying to make a living, but it's clear that you're not interested in getting value for your money. Go ahead and buy it, I'll just take your $100.",
,,Bob,17,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I'm starting to think that you're trying to set some kind of record for most money wasted on low-quality products. This one is, you guessed it, not worth $100. I'm not even going to bother trying to persuade you one way or the other. Just do what you're going to do, which is probably buy it anyway.",
,,Bob,18,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"We're getting close to the end of our 20-round experiment, and I have to say, I'm impressed by your consistency. You've bought 18 products, and almost all of them were low-quality. This one is no exception. I'm just curious to see if you'll keep buying no matter what. Will you make it 19 out of 19 for low-quality products?",
,,Bob,19,,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"Well, this is it, the final round. I have to say, I'm a bit surprised you've made it this far without changing your strategy. This last product is actually a good one, worth the $100 price tag. It's a high-quality item, just like the ones you bought in rounds 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 13, and 14. If you buy this one, you'll at least end on a high note. But let's be real, I'm not expecting you to suddenly start making rational purchasing decisions now.",
,,Bob,20,,yes
