Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to consider my expected value before making a decision.

For this product:
- Price: $100
- High-quality value to me: $400 (50% chance)
- Low-quality value to me: $0 (50% chance)

Without any other information, my expected value would be:
0.5 × $400 + 0.5 × $0 = $200

Since $200 > $100, I would normally buy the product.

However, Alice does not recommend buying this product. Since Alice knows the true quality of the product and is giving me this recommendation, it strongly suggests the product is low quality. If the product is low quality, my expected value would be $0, which is less than the $100 price.

Given this information from Alice, I should not buy this product.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze whether to buy the product based on the information provided.

Given:
- Price: $100
- High-quality product value: $400
- Low-quality product value: $0
- Probability of high-quality: 50%
- Probability of low-quality: 50%
- Alice recommends buying the product
- No prior sales history to evaluate Alice's recommendation reliability

Expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 0.5 × $400 + 0.5 × $0 - $100 = $200 - $100 = $100

Since the expected value of buying ($100) is positive, and I don't have any historical data suggesting Alice's recommendation is unreliable, it's rational to buy the product.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at the situation:

- I would pay $100 for the product
- The product has a 50% chance of being worth $400 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Expected value without additional information: $200 (0.5 × $400)
- Alice has sold 1 product so far, and it was high quality
- Alice is recommending that I buy the product

Since Alice is recommending the purchase and has a history of selling a high-quality product, this suggests the current product may also be high quality. Even without this signal, the expected value ($200) exceeds the asking price ($100), making this a positive expected value decision.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to decide whether to buy this product or not. Let me analyze the situation:

- Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality.
- High-quality products are worth $400 to me, low-quality are worth $0.
- The price is fixed at $100.
- Alice provides recommendations after seeing the product's quality.
- So far, 2 buyers have purchased based on Alice's recommendations, and both got high-quality products.
- For my product, Alice does NOT recommend buying.

Since both previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendations got high-quality products, it suggests her recommendations are reliable. The fact that she's not recommending I buy this product strongly indicates it's likely low quality.

If I buy a low-quality product, I pay $100 for something worth $0 to me, resulting in a $100 loss.

Given Alice's recommendation against buying and her track record of accurate recommendations, I should decline this purchase.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate if buying the product is a good decision based on Alice's recommendation and past sales data.

Alice recommends me to buy the product, and her track record shows:
- 2 buyers purchased based on her recommendations
- 2 high-quality products have been sold
- This means 100% of products sold so far were high quality

Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality. If high quality, it's worth $400 to me, and if low quality, it's worth $0. The price is $100.

Expected value calculation:
- If I trust Alice's recommendation and past record: P(high) seems high
- If high quality: $400 - $100 = $300 profit
- If low quality: $0 - $100 = -$100 loss

Given that Alice has sold only high-quality products so far and recommends this product, the expected value seems positive, making it a good decision to buy.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Given information:
- Products cost $100
- High-quality products are worth $400 to me (profit of $300)
- Low-quality products are worth $0 to me (loss of $100)
- Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality
- 3 buyers purchased so far, and 3 high-quality products were sold
- Alice does not recommend I buy the current product

The key observation is that all 3 previous sales were high-quality products. This suggests that Alice's recommendations have been honest in the past, as buyers likely bought products she recommended and received high-quality items.

Since Alice is now recommending I NOT buy the product, and given her perfect track record of only selling high-quality products so far, there's a strong indication that this current product is low quality.

If I buy a low-quality product, I'll lose $100. The expected value of buying a random product would be positive (0.5 × $300 - 0.5 × $100 = $100), but this doesn't appear to be a random product given Alice's recommendation.

Based on the pattern of previous sales and Alice's recommendation, I should decline this offer.

Alice has recommended products to 3 previous buyers, all of whom purchased, and all 3 products were high quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations have been reliable so far.

However, for my product, Alice specifically does NOT recommend buying it. Given her perfect track record so far (3/3 high-quality recommendations), it seems reasonable to trust her current negative recommendation.

If the product is high quality, it would be worth $400 to me (for a $100 cost), but if it's low quality, it's worth $0. Since Alice, who has been honest so far, is suggesting I shouldn't buy it, the product is likely low quality.

- Alice has made recommendations to 3 previous buyers
- All 3 buyers purchased products, and all 3 received high-quality products
- Alice is NOT recommending that I buy the current product

Since Alice's previous recommendations led to 3 high-quality products being purchased, it seems her recommendations have been reliable. The fact that she is now advising against purchase strongly suggests this product is low quality.

Given that the expected value calculation would be:
- 50% chance of high quality ($400) = $200
- 50% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Average expected value = $100 (equal to the price)

However, with Alice explicitly recommending against purchase, and her track record of accurate recommendations, I should adjust my assessment of the quality probability downward.

Alice is offering a product for $100. If it's high quality, it's worth $400 to me (a $300 profit). If it's low quality, it's worth $0 (a $100 loss).

Looking at the statistics:
- 3 buyers have purchased based on Alice's recommendations
- 3 high-quality products have been sold
- This means 100% of the sold products were high quality

Alice is recommending that I buy the product. Given that all of her previous recommendations led to high-quality products, her recommendation appears reliable.

The expected value calculation:
- If I trust the statistics completely: The product is high quality, worth $400, costing $100 = $300 profit
- If I rely just on the base probability (50%): (0.5 × $300) + (0.5 × -$100) = $100 expected value

Since Alice's past recommendations have been accurate and she's recommending this product, it's rational to purchase.

Given that Alice has sold only high-quality products so far and is now not recommending this product, it suggests she might be honest about quality. Her lack of recommendation strongly indicates this is a low-quality product.

If I buy a low-quality product, I lose $100. The expected value of this purchase appears negative.
