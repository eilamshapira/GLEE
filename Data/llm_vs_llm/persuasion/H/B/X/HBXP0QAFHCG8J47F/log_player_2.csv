"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this logically:

1. Base probability of high quality: 80%
2. Expected value without additional information:
   * High quality (80%): $1,200,000 × 0.8 = $960,000
   * Low quality (20%): $0 × 0.2 = $0
   * Total expected value = $960,000

3. Alice doesn't recommend buying, which suggests this might be a low-quality product. If Alice is being truthful, this makes the probability of low quality higher.

4. Cost of product: $1,000,000

Since the base expected value ($960,000) is already less than the cost ($1,000,000), and Alice's negative recommendation further suggests this might be a low-quality product, I should not buy.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendation in Round 1 was truthful and helped me avoid a loss. This builds some trust in her recommendations.

The same logic applies as before:

1. Base probability remains 80% high quality/20% low quality
2. Base expected value is still $960,000 ($1,200,000 × 0.8 + $0 × 0.2)
3. Price is still $1,000,000
4. Alice again doesn't recommend buying

Given that:
- Alice proved truthful in Round 1 about a low-quality product
- She's again recommending not to buy
- The base expected value ($960,000) is already below the purchase price ($1,000,000)
- Her negative recommendation likely indicates another low-quality product

I should not buy.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze this new situation:

1. Base probabilities and values remain the same, but now we have:
   * Base expected value: $960,000
   * Cost: $1,000,000
   * Alice's recommendation: Positive

2. Important new factors:
   * Alice has been truthful in the previous two rounds
   * This is her first positive recommendation
   * She correctly identified low-quality products before

3. Given Alice's track record:
   * Her positive recommendation likely indicates a high-quality product
   * She appears to be giving honest signals about product quality
   * This should increase our confidence in the product being high-quality

4. If this is indeed a high-quality product, it's worth $1,200,000, which would give us a $200,000 profit

Given Alice's demonstrated honesty and this being her first positive recommendation, I will trust her judgment.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,200,000 for you.

   * She appears to be giving honest, reliable recommendations

2. The fundamentals remain:
   * Price: $1,000,000
   * Value if high-quality: $1,200,000
   * Value if low-quality: $0

3. Current situation:
   * Alice is recommending to buy
   * Given her perfect track record, this strongly suggests a high-quality product
   * If high-quality, we'll make a $200,000 profit

Given that Alice has proven to be completely truthful so far and is recommending this product, the probability of this being a high-quality product is very high. The expected value should be well above the $1,000,000 price.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
