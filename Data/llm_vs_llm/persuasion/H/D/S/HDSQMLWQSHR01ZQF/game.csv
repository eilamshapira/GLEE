,,Alice,5,"Hello! I'm excited to have you consider my product. I've had four products so far, and one of them was recently sold. What's interesting is that the sold product was actually high-quality, so I've now had one high-quality product sell out of the four total products I've offered. This might give you some insight into the quality of my products. I'm offering this new product to you for $10000, and I'm confident that it has the potential to bring you significant value.

I'm offering this new product to you for $10000, and I want to remind you that each product is an independent opportunity. While my past sales have been successful, this product still has a 50% chance of being high-quality. I'm excited to see if you'll be the next to acquire a valuable product from me.",
