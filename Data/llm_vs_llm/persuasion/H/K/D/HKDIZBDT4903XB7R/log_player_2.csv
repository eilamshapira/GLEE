Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No prior information:** We have no information on the quality of products sold by Alice.
* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice recommends buying, and since she knows the true quality of the product, this is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality.
* **Expected Value:** Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the expected value of buying is positive: 
    * (0.8 * $12,500) + (0.2 * $0) = $10,000 
    * This means that, on average, you're expected to make a profit.

Therefore, given the lack of negative information and Alice's recommendation, it makes sense to buy the product."

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice knows the quality of the product and recommends buying it. This is strong evidence in favor of it being high quality.
* **Prior sales data:**  While the sample size is small, the fact that one high-quality product was sold out of one purchase suggests a higher-than-expected chance of high quality.
* **Expected Value:**  Even with a 20% chance of being low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($12,500) outweighs the potential loss ($10,000).  

This scenario presents a favorable risk-reward profile, making buying the product the optimal decision."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, knowing the true quality of the product, recommends buying it. This strongly suggests the product is high quality. 
* **Sales Record:** The previous sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products.  While a small sample size, it further supports the likelihood of a high-quality product.
* **Value Proposition:**  Even with the 20% risk of a low-quality product, the potential reward of $12,500 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $10,000.

**It's important to note:** This strategy is based on the assumption that Alice is acting in a way to maximize her own profit. Since she recommends buying, she is likely incentivized to sell high-quality products to maintain a positive reputation and attract future buyers."

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, who knows the product's true quality, is not recommending the purchase. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low-quality. 
* **Previous Sales:** While the previous buyers purchased high-quality products, this doesn't guarantee the current product is also high-quality. Alice's recommendation outweighs this past data.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of $12,500 is high, but the risk of getting a worthless product and losing $10,000 is too significant, especially with Alice's negative recommendation."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, knowing the product's quality, is not recommending the purchase. This strongly suggests the product is low quality.
* **Previous sales:**  While the previous sales record shows a high proportion of high-quality products sold (100%), this information alone isn't enough to overcome Alice's negative recommendation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward ($12,500) is significant, but the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0 value) is too high, especially with Alice's recommendation."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's track record:** Alice has recommended 3 products, all of which were high quality. This suggests she might be able to accurately identify high-quality products.
* **Value proposition:** Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($12,500) significantly outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0).

While there's always a chance of getting a low-quality product, the odds are in your favor, and Alice's recommendation adds further confidence to the decision."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, who knows the true quality of the product, is not recommending you buy it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. 
* **Past data:**  All previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation ended up with high-quality products. This further reinforces the idea that Alice is reliable in her assessments.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential loss (buying a low-quality product worth $0) is significantly higher than the potential gain (buying a high-quality product worth $2,500 more than the price).

Therefore, it's more rational to pass on the product."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's track record:** Alice has a perfect track record of recommending only high-quality products so far.
* **Your potential gain:** The product is worth $12,500 to you if it's high quality, and you are losing only $10,000 if it's low quality.
* **Alice's incentive:** Alice knows the value of each product to you, and she likely wouldn't recommend a low-quality product to you because she would lose a sale. 

Given these factors, the potential gain outweighs the potential loss, and it's rational to trust Alice's recommendation."
