I will continue to buy the product as long as Alice recommends it, as her recommendations have been accurate so far. The expected value of buying the product based on the given probabilities is:

(0.8 * $2,000,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $1,600,000

Since this expected value is greater than the cost of the product ($1,000,000), it makes sense to continue buying when recommended."
