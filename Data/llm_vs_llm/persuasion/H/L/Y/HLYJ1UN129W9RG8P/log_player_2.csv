Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The base probability is 80% high quality (worth $20,000) and 20% low quality (worth $0)
2. The price is $10,000
3. Alice doesn't recommend buying
4. There's no prior sales history

Even though Alice doesn't recommend buying, let's consider the expected value:
- 80% chance of $20,000 = $16,000
- 20% chance of $0 = $0
- Expected value = $16,000
- Cost = $10,000
- Net expected value = $6,000

Since there's no sales history to provide additional context, I should mainly rely on the base probabilities. Even with Alice's negative recommendation, the expected value is still positive and significant.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1) Expected value calculation:
* 80% chance of high quality: 0.8 × $20,000 = $16,000
* 20% chance of low quality: 0.2 × $0 = $0
* Total expected value = $16,000

2) The price is $10,000, which is less than the expected value.

3) Looking at the statistics:
* One previous buyer purchased
* 0 high-quality products have been sold
* This suggests the previous sale might have been a low-quality product

4) However, Alice is recommending to buy the product.

Despite the concerning previous sale statistics, the fundamental probability (80% high quality) and Alice's recommendation make this a positive expected value opportunity. The expected value ($16,000) is significantly higher than the price ($10,000).

1. Expected value calculation:
* 80% chance of high quality ($20,000) = $16,000
* 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
* Total expected value = $16,000
* Price = $10,000
* Expected profit = $6,000

2. Seller's track record:
* 2 buyers so far
* 1 high-quality product sold out of 2 (50%)
* This is lower than the stated 80% probability
* However, small sample size

3. Alice's recommendation:
* Alice knows the true value
* Alice is recommending to buy
* She has a mixed track record (1/2 high quality)

Despite the somewhat concerning track record, the fundamentals are still favorable:
- Expected value is significantly higher than the price
- Alice is recommending the purchase
- The sample size is too small to override the base 80% probability

Given this analysis, I will take the risk.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Prior probability:
- 80% chance of high quality
- 20% chance of low quality

2. Past sales data:
- 3 buyers purchased
- 2 high-quality products sold (66.67% of sales)
- This performance is below the expected 80% rate

3. Expected value calculation:
- High quality (80%): $20,000 * 0.8 = $16,000
- Low quality (20%): $0 * 0.2 = $0
- Total expected value: $16,000

4. Cost: $10,000

Since the expected value ($16,000) is higher than the cost ($10,000), and Alice is recommending the purchase, it's rational to buy despite the slightly lower-than-expected performance in past sales.

1. Product base probabilities:
- 80% chance of high quality ($20,000 value)
- 20% chance of low quality ($0 value)

2. Sales history:
- 4 previous buyers
- 3 high-quality products sold
- This matches closely with the expected 80% high-quality rate
- Alice's recommendations seem reliable

3. Expected value calculation:
- If high quality (80%): $20,000
- If low quality (20%): $0
- Expected value = (0.8 × $20,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $16,000

4. Cost of product: $10,000

Since the expected value ($16,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($10,000), and Alice's track record appears trustworthy with a 75% success rate (3/4) that's close to the stated 80% probability, this appears to be a good investment.

5. Past performance:

The expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of $20,000 = $16,000

- Low quality (20%): $0 × 0.2 = $0

Since:
- The expected value ($16,000) is higher than the cost ($10,000)

- Alice is recommending the purchase
- The prior probability favors high quality (80%)

5. Sales history:

   - This means 85.7% of sold products were high quality
6. Alice recommends buying

The historical data (85.7% high quality) aligns well with the base probability (80%), and Alice's recommendation adds credibility. 

Expected value calculation:
- If 80% chance of high quality: (0.8 × $20,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $16,000
- Cost is $10,000
- Expected profit = $16,000 - $10,000 = $6,000

Looking at Alice's track record:
