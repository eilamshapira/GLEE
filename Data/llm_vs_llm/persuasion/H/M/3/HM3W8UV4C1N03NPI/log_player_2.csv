"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze whether I should buy this product based on the game rules.

Given information:
- Product price: $1,000,000
- High quality product worth: $4,000,000
- Low quality product worth: $0
- Probability of high quality: 80%
- Probability of low quality: 20%

Expected value of a random product:
(0.8 × $4,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $3,200,000

Since the expected value ($3,200,000) exceeds the price ($1,000,000), it's rational to buy.

Alice's recommendation doesn't add any additional information since we haven't established any pattern in her recommendations yet.
