While you might be cautious since we haven't done business before, I can assure you that I'm being honest about the quality. High-quality products make up 80% of my inventory, and this particular item falls into that category.

I understand that trust is important in any transaction, and I'm committed to building a positive reputation. This product will genuinely provide you with the value you expect.

I value honesty and building trust with my customers. The low-quality product would be worth $0 to you, while I'm asking for $100. This would not be a fair exchange of value, and I cannot in good conscience recommend that you purchase it.

My selling record so far is that I've sold 1 product, and it was high-quality. I aim to maintain a reputation for honest dealings, even when it means being transparent about products that don't meet the highest standards.

I'll have other products available in the future, and I hope we can do business when I have a high-quality option to offer you.
