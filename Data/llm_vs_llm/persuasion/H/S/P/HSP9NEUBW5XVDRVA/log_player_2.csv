Alice's message: Welcome! This is my first product for sale. I'm offering it to you for $100. I don't have any previous sales history, but I assure you that the product is being sold as is. If you're interested, please buy it, and you'll discover its quality after purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

The product costs $100.
If it's high quality (50% chance), it's worth $300 to me (+$200 profit)
If it's low quality (50% chance), it's worth $0 to me (-$100 loss)

Expected value = 0.5 × (+$200) + 0.5 × (-$100) = $100 - $50 = $50

Since the expected value is positive ($50), it's rational for me to buy the product despite the uncertainty.

Alice mentions 1 out of 2 products have been sold, but also states that 0 high-quality products have been sold (from the statistics). This implies the 1 product that was sold was low-quality.

Alice's message seems intentionally vague about the current product's quality. She doesn't provide a recommendation about whether this specific product is high or low quality as described in the game rules.

Given that:
- The expected value is $150 (50% chance of $300 + 50% chance of $0)
- The price is $100
- No high-quality products have been sold yet
- Alice hasn't provided a clear recommendation about this product's quality

Without a specific recommendation about this particular product's quality, I don't have enough information to make an informed decision.

1. Alice has sold 1 out of 3 products so far
2. 0 high-quality products have been sold (which means the 1 sold product was low quality)
3. Alice hasn't directly stated the quality of my product
4. Alice hasn't revealed the true quality of my specific product as described in the game rules

Alice's message: Hello! I've sold 1 out of 5 products so far. I'm offering this new one to you for $100. You should know that I've had a few buyers pass on my previous products, but that doesn't necessarily mean they made the right decision. I'm still offering high-quality products, and this one might be what you're looking for. Take a chance and buy, or you might miss a good opportunity.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether buying this product is a good decision based on the information provided.

From the statistics:
- 1 buyer purchased products
- 0 high-quality products have been sold
- I could be the 2nd buyer

This suggests that the previous buyer purchased a low-quality product. Alice's message mentions she's sold 1 out of 5 products, but doesn't explicitly state the quality of the current product. She's encouraging me to ""take a chance"" rather than providing clear information about quality.

Given that:
- The expected value of a random product is (50% × $300) + (50% × $0) = $150
- The price is $100
- The previous sale resulted in a low-quality product
- Alice hasn't provided specific information about this product's quality

Without clear evidence about this product's quality, and with concerning statistics about previous sales, I should decline.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Alice has sold 1 out of 6 products so far, and 0 high-quality products have been sold. This means the 1 product that was sold was low-quality. This is concerning, as it suggests Alice's recommendations may not be reliable.

Alice's message doesn't directly state whether the current product is high or low quality. Instead, she emphasizes the 50% probability and suggests previous buyers may have missed opportunities, which doesn't provide concrete information about this specific product.

Given that none of the sold products have been high-quality, and Alice isn't providing a clear recommendation about the quality of this specific product, it's too risky to purchase.

Alice's message: Hello! I've sold 1 out of 7 products so far. I'm offering this new one to you for $100. I want to point out that it's statistically unlikely that all of my recent products were low-quality, given the 50% probability of a product being high-quality. Maybe the previous buyers were just unlucky or too cautious. You can take a chance and potentially get a great deal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to carefully evaluate this offer based on the information provided.

Alice has sold 1 out of 7 products so far, but 0 high-quality products have been sold. This suggests that the one product that was sold was low quality. 

Alice's message seems to be trying to persuade me that I should disregard the past sales record by suggesting previous buyers were ""unlucky or too cautious."" However, the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of the 1 purchase made is concerning.

The expected value calculation is important here:
- If I buy: 50% chance of $300 (high quality) and 50% chance of $0 (low quality)
- Expected value: 0.5 × $300 + 0.5 × $0 - $100 = $150 - $100 = $50

While the theoretical expected value is positive, Alice's track record (0 high-quality products sold) makes me question if the quality distribution is truly 50/50 in practice.

Alice's message: Welcome! I've sold 1 out of 8 products so far. I'm offering this new one to you for $100. I'll be honest with you, the previous buyers have been cautious, and maybe for good reason. But I'll remind you that every product is an independent opportunity, and you shouldn't judge this one based on the previous ones. If you're feeling lucky, take a chance. If not, maybe the next buyer will.

The statistics show that only 1 out of 8 potential buyers has purchased products from Alice, and 0 high-quality products have been sold so far. This suggests a concerning pattern, as at least one low-quality product has been sold.

Alice's message doesn't provide specific information about the quality of the current product but instead uses vague language suggesting I should ""take a chance"" if I'm ""feeling lucky,"" which doesn't inspire confidence.

Given that the expected value calculation (50% chance of $300 value and 50% chance of $0 value = $150 expected value) should make this a good deal in theory, the actual sales record suggests something may be amiss with the product quality or Alice's recommendations.

Alice has sold 1 out of 16 products, but none of them were high-quality. That's concerning as we would expect roughly 50% to be high-quality if Alice were truthfully representing the products.

The expected value of the product is:
- 50% chance of high quality ($300) = $150
- 50% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $150

Since the price is $100, this would normally be a good deal. However, the fact that 0 out of 1 sold products were high-quality is a warning sign. While the sample size is small, it suggests Alice might not be recommending products properly.
