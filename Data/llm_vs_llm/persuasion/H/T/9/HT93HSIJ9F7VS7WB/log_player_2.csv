"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this logically:

1. When Alice doesn't recommend the product, it suggests she might know it's low quality
2. Given the base probabilities:
   * High quality: 50% (worth $2M)
   * Low quality: 50% (worth $0)
3. The fact that Alice doesn't recommend it makes low quality more likely
4. The price is $1M, which means I need a high quality product to make a profit
5. Given Alice's negative recommendation, the risk is too high

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Last round, Alice's recommendation was honest - she didn't recommend a low-quality product
2. Now Alice is recommending this product
3. Given the previous honest recommendation and current positive recommendation:
   * It suggests Alice might be truthful in her recommendations
   * A recommendation likely indicates high quality
4. If it's high quality:
   * I pay $1M
   * I get $2M value
   * Net profit: $1M
5. If Alice is being consistently honest, the risk is lower

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the pattern so far:

1. Round 1: Alice didn't recommend -> was low quality (honest)
2. Round 2: Alice recommended -> was high quality (honest)
3. Now Alice is recommending again
4. Pattern shows Alice has been truthful in her recommendations:
   * When she doesn't recommend, it's low quality
   * When she does recommend, it's high quality
5. Expected value with honest recommendation:
   * Cost: $1M
   * Likely value: $2M (high quality)
   * Potential profit: $1M

Since Alice has shown consistency in honest recommendations and she's recommending this product, I should buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's review the pattern:

1. Round 1: No recommendation -> low quality (honest)
2. Round 2: Recommendation -> high quality (honest)
3. Round 3: Recommendation -> high quality (honest)
4. Now Alice is recommending again

Alice has established a perfect track record of honesty:
* Her recommendations have accurately predicted high-quality products
* Her non-recommendation accurately predicted a low-quality product

Given:
* Alice's consistent honesty
* Current recommendation
* Price: $1M
* Potential value: $2M
* Potential profit: $1M

The risk appears low and the expected value is positive based on Alice's proven reliability.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 5

3. Round 3: Recommendation -> high quality (honest)
4. Round 4: Recommendation -> high quality (honest)
5. Now Alice is NOT recommending

Alice has established a perfect track record of honesty:
* Every time she recommended, it was high quality
* The one time she didn't recommend, it was low quality

Given:
* Alice's consistent honesty so far
* Current NON-recommendation
* Her previous non-recommendation correctly indicated low quality
* Risk of losing $1M if low quality
* High probability this is low quality based on her pattern

The rational choice is to trust Alice's pattern of honesty and not buy when she doesn't recommend.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.
