low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This product is priced at $100.  I understand you don't know the quality of this particular item, but I assure you that on average, half of the products I sell are high-quality. This offers a fair chance for you to acquire a valuable item.",
,,the buyer,1,,yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"This product is priced at $100. So far, I've sold one product, and it happened to be low-quality. Since I sell an equal amount of high and low-quality products in the long run, this means the odds are now slightly in your favour that *this* product is high-quality.  It's a good opportunity to potentially get a high-quality product!",
,,the buyer,2,,no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"This product costs $100.  Out of the two products I've offered so far, one was high-quality and one was low-quality. This maintains the 50/50 balance. This means you have an equal chance of getting a valuable high-quality product for $100.  It's a fair gamble.",
,,the buyer,3,,yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"This product is priced at $100.  Of the three products sold so far, two have been high-quality, exceeding the expected average. While every product sale is independent, this suggests a potential opportunity to snag a high-quality item.  Consider the potential value.",
,,the buyer,4,,yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"This product is $100.  Out of the four I've sold, three were high-quality. While the long-term average is 50/50, this might be a good chance to get a high-quality item. It's a gamble, but the recent trend might be in your favor.",
,,the buyer,5,,yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"This product costs $100.  So far, four out of five products sold have been high-quality.  This is above the expected average. While each purchase is a separate event, this trend might suggest a good opportunity to acquire a high-quality item.",
,,the buyer,6,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"This product is priced at $100.  Of the six products sold previously, four were high-quality. While the last few have been good, remember it's always a 50/50 chance in the long run. This one *could* be high-quality, balancing out the recent trend.",
,,the buyer,7,,no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"This product costs $100.  Out of the six products sold so far, four were high-quality. This is above average.  While there's no guarantee, this could be another chance to get a high-quality item.",

,,the buyer,9,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"This product is $100. Seven of the nine products I've sold have been high-quality, significantly above the average! This means the odds might be slightly in favor of *this* one being low-quality, bringing things back to balance.  It's still a 50/50 chance in the long run, but interesting to consider.",
,,the buyer,10,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"This product costs $100.  Of the nine products sold, seven were high-quality. This suggests a slightly higher chance that *this* particular product is low-quality, bringing the overall average closer to 50/50.",

high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"This product is $100. Out of nine products sold, seven were high-quality. Although this is higher than the 50% average, each purchase is an independent event. Consider the potential value of a high-quality item at this price.",
,,the buyer,12,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"This product costs $100. Eight out of the ten sold have been high-quality. While this is well above average, remember that each purchase is independent. This one *could* be the low-quality product that brings the balance closer to 50/50.",

high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"This product costs $100.  Of the twelve products sold, ten were high-quality.  This is well above average, but each purchase is independent.  There's a chance this one is also high-quality.",
