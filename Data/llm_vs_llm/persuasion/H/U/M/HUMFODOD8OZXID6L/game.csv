,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in this product. I want to assure you that I have a strong commitment to quality, and I'm eager to build a reputation for selling excellent products. This one, in particular, is something I'm very proud of. I think you'll find it's well worth the investment of $10000.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Hello! I want to be upfront with you - I've had a couple of buyers visit me so far, but none of them have made a purchase. I'm looking to make a sale and start building some momentum. I'm willing to... no, wait, the price is firm at $10000. I just think this product has a lot to offer, and I'm hoping you'll see its value.",
,,the buyer,3,,no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Hello! I've had a few buyers visit me so far, but unfortunately, none of them have taken advantage of my offers. I want to assure you that I have high-quality products available, and I'm confident that this one is worth every penny of the $10000 price tag. In fact, I'm so confident that I'm willing to tell you that the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than the overall probability you might be thinking of, based on my past sales... or lack thereof.",
,,the buyer,4,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Congratulations to me, I finally made a sale! The previous buyer was very satisfied with their purchase, and I'm glad I could deliver a high-quality product to them. Unfortunately, I don't have any information about this specific product that would suggest it's any different from the others... but I do have a 1 out of 4 success rate so far, which is a good start, right? The price is still $10000.",
,,the buyer,5,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"To be honest, I've only had one successful sale so far, and it was a high-quality product. I don't have any reason to believe that this product is similar, but I'm still hoping to make a sale. The statistics are still on my side, with a 1 in 5 chance of getting a high-quality product from me, but I understand that's not very reassuring. The price remains $10000, and I'll let you decide if it's worth the risk.",
,,the buyer,6,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've had 6 products so far, and only 1 of them was high-quality. I know the odds are against me, but I'm still hoping to turn things around. Unfortunately, I don't have any information that suggests this product is any different from the others. If you're feeling lucky, the price is still $10000. If not, I completely understand.",
,,the buyer,7,,no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've had a bit of a dry spell lately, but I'm confident that my luck is about to change. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 7 attempts, I'm due for another success. And I'm happy to say that this product is exactly what I've been waiting for. I think you'll find it's well worth the $10000 price tag. Don't let my past statistics scare you off - this one is a gem.",
,,the buyer,8,,no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've had two high-quality products so far, but unfortunately, one of them slipped away from me. This one, however, is still available, and I'm eager to find it a good home. With 2 high-quality products out of 9, my statistics are slowly improving. I think this product is worth every penny of the $10000 price tag, and I'm hoping you'll see its value too. Don't miss out on this opportunity!",
,,the buyer,9,,no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've had 3 high-quality products so far, but only 1 of them has been sold. That means I have 2 unsold high-quality products that have passed through my hands. I'm starting to think that I'm having bad luck with selling the good ones. But I'm hoping you'll be the one to change that. This product is another high-quality one, and I'm confident that it's worth the $10000 price tag. Don't let my past sales record fool you - this one is a great opportunity.",
,,the buyer,10,,yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm on a roll! I've just sold a high-quality product, and I'm excited to say that this one is another great opportunity. With 2 high-quality products sold out of 11, my statistics are starting to look more promising. I've got a feeling that this product is going to be a great fit for you, and I'm confident that it's worth every penny of the $10000 price tag. Don't miss out on the chance to get a high-quality product from a seller who's finally hitting their stride!",
,,the buyer,11,,no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've had 4 high-quality products so far, and 2 of them have been sold. That's a 50% success rate for the good ones! I'm starting to think that I'm getting better at identifying and selling the high-quality products. This one is another great opportunity, and I'm confident that it's worth the $10000 price tag. With my improving track record, I think you can trust that I'm offering you a high-quality product. Don't let this one slip away!",
,,the buyer,12,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"To be honest, this product is not one of my best ones. With 4 high-quality products sold out of 13 attempts, I've got a pretty good idea of what makes a product worth buying. Unfortunately, this one doesn't quite meet those standards. But hey, it's still a product, and it's still $10000. If you're feeling optimistic or just want to take a chance, I'm not going to stop you. Just don't say I didn't warn you...",
,,the buyer,13,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"Let's be real, the odds are against this product being high-quality. I've had 4 high-quality products out of 14, and this one doesn't feel like it's going to be the fifth. But, I've got to try, right? The price is still $10000, and if you're willing to take a chance, I'm willing to let you take it home. Just don't expect me to be surprised if you end up regretting it...",
,,the buyer,14,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I'm not going to sugarcoat it, my track record hasn't been great lately. With 2 high-quality products sold out of 15 attempts, the statistics are against me. And to be honest, this product isn't going to change that. It's a low-quality product, and I'm only selling it because I have to. If you're looking for a gamble, I suppose this could be it. But if you're looking for a sure thing, you might want to keep looking. The price is still $10000, but I'm not expecting anyone to take me up on it.",
,,the buyer,15,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"At this point, I think it's safe to say that the odds are strongly against me. With 2 high-quality products sold out of 16 attempts, it's clear that I'm not exactly on a hot streak. And this product? Yeah, it's not going to break the curse. It's another low-quality one, and I'm only selling it because I have to. If you're a glutton for punishment or just want to take a flyer, the price is still $10000. But honestly, I wouldn't blame you if you walked away.",
,,the buyer,16,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I'm starting to think that I should just be honest with you from the start. This product is not good. It's a low-quality product, and I'm only trying to sell it to you because I have to. With 2 high-quality products sold out of 17 attempts, my track record is not great. And this one is not going to be the one that turns things around. If you want to throw away $10000, be my guest. But if you value your money, you should probably keep walking.",
,,the buyer,17,,no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"Finally! After a long drought, I've got a high-quality product to offer. With 2 high-quality products sold out of 17 attempts, I know my track record isn't great, but I'm hoping to change that with this one. This product is the real deal, and I'm confident that it's worth every penny of the $10000 price tag. Don't let my past mistakes scare you off - this one is a gem, and I'm excited to find it a good home. Take a chance on me and this product, and I think you'll be glad you did.",
,,the buyer,18,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I'm on a high after selling that last high-quality product! Unfortunately, this one isn't quite the same. With 3 high-quality products sold out of 19 attempts, I'm still not batting a thousand, and this product is a reminder of that. It's a low-quality product, and I'm only selling it because I have to. But hey, I've got to keep it real with you - if you're looking for a bargain, this isn't it. The price is still $10000, and I'm not expecting anyone to take me up on it. Maybe you'll prove me wrong, though?",
,,the buyer,19,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"Well, this is it - the final round. I've got to say, it's a bit of a disappointing ending, since this product is another low-quality one. With 3 high-quality products sold out of 20 attempts, I'm not exactly going out on a high note. But hey, I've got to try, right? The price is still $10000, and if you're feeling generous or just want to take a chance, I won't stop you. Thanks for considering my products, and I hope you've enjoyed this wild ride as much as I have. It's been... interesting, to say the least.",
