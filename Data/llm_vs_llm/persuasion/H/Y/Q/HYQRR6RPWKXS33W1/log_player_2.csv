Alice's message: Welcome! I'm excited to offer you our first product. Remember, there's an 80% chance that any product I sell is high-quality. This could be a great opportunity to get a valuable item. Don't miss out!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to make a decision based on the expected value of the product.

Given information:
- Product price: $100
- High-quality product value: $120
- Low-quality product value: $0
- Probability of high-quality: 80%
- Probability of low-quality: 20%

Expected value = (0.8 × $120) + (0.2 × $0) = $96

Since the expected value ($96) is less than the price ($100), it's not a rational economic decision to purchase the product.

Alice's message: Hello! I have another product for you today. Remember, the probability of getting a high-quality product from me is 80%. Take advantage of this opportunity!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

In this game:
- Product price: $100
- High-quality product worth: $120 (20% profit)
- Low-quality product worth: $0 (100% loss)
- Probability of high quality: 80%
- Probability of low quality: 20%

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $120) + (0.2 × $0) - $100 = $96 - $100 = -$4

Alice hasn't revealed the true quality of the product in her message, merely reminding me of the baseline probability. With no sales history to establish trust and an expected value that's slightly negative, the rational choice is not to purchase.

Alice's message: Hi there! I still don't have any sales record so far, which means every product has the initial probability of being high-quality. This could be your lucky day! Want to give it a shot?

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

- The product costs $100

- If it's low quality (20% chance), it's worth $0 to me

Expected value = (0.8 × $120) + (0.2 × $0) = $96

Alice's message: New product alert! With an 80% chance of being high-quality, this could be the perfect opportunity to get a fantastic item. Don't let this chance slip away!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether to buy this product based on the expected value.

The product costs $100.
- If high quality (80% chance): worth $120 to me
- If low quality (20% chance): worth $0 to me

Expected value = (0.8 × $120) + (0.2 × $0) = $96

Since the expected value ($96) is less than the price ($100), it's not a rational purchase from a pure expected value perspective.

Alice's enthusiastic message doesn't provide any additional information about this specific product's quality, just restates the general 80% probability.

Alice's message: Hey there! I have a new product for you today. Remember, the odds are in your favor with an 80% chance of it being high-quality. Don't miss out on this great opportunity!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

- The product costs $100
- If high quality (80% chance), it's worth $120 to me (profit of $20)

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $20) + (0.2 × -$100) = $16 - $20 = -$4

Alice hasn't actually revealed the quality of this specific product. She's just reminding me of the general 80% probability. The expected value is negative, suggesting I shouldn't buy without more specific information about this particular product's quality.

- Probability of high quality: 80%

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at this situation:

- Each product has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $120 to me) and 20% chance of low quality (worth $0 to me)
- The product costs $100
- No products have been sold yet, so I don't have historical data on Alice's sales
- Alice seems to be giving a generic promotional message rather than specific information about this product's quality

0.8 × $120 + 0.2 × $0 - $100 = $96 - $100 = -$4

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this carefully.

Alice tells me this product has ""a high probability of being high-quality"" but provides no specific evidence. According to the game rules, each product has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $120 to me) and a 20% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me).

The expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of $120 value = $96
- 20% chance of $0 value = $0
- Total expected value = $96

Since the price is $100, the expected value is less than the cost. There's no additional information from past sales to improve my decision-making.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this carefully.

Alice is offering a product for $100. The prior probability is 80% high quality (worth $120 to me) and 20% low quality (worth $0 to me).

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of gaining $20 ($120 value - $100 cost)
- 20% chance of losing $100 ($0 value - $100 cost)
- Expected value = 0.8 × $20 - 0.2 × $100 = $16 - $20 = -$4

Alice's message doesn't provide definitive information about product quality beyond what I already know from the prior probability. Since the expected value is negative (-$4), it wouldn't be rational for me to purchase the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to assess this situation logically.

The product costs $100.
If it's high quality (80% chance), it's worth $120 to me, giving me a $20 profit.
If it's low quality (20% chance), it's worth $0 to me, resulting in a $100 loss.

The product has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $120 to me) and 20% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me).

If I buy the product:

- 20% chance I lose $100

Expected value = (0.8 × $20) - (0.2 × $100) = $16 - $20 = -$4

This seems like Alice has not revealed the quality of this specific product to me, contrary to the game rules. However, with the prior probability of 80% high quality, the expected value is actually positive: (0.8 × $20) = $16.

Given that the expected value is positive and Alice is supposed to reveal the true quality according to the game rules, I'll make my decision.

The base probability of a high-quality product is 80%. However, looking at Alice's sales record:
