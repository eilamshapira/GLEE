Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (80% chance): $1,200,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $1,200,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $960,000

The expected value ($960,000) is less than the asking price ($1,000,000), even though Alice recommends buying. Without any track record to establish Alice's credibility in recommendations, and given that the expected value is below the purchase price, it would be rational to decline.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Prior probability of high quality: 80%
2. Product price: $1,000,000
3. Value to me: $1,200,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
4. Expected value without recommendation = (0.8 × $1,200,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $960,000
5. Alice doesn't recommend buying, which suggests it might be low quality
6. No previous sales data to establish Alice's recommendation patterns

Given that Alice doesn't recommend the purchase and the expected value without this signal is already below the asking price, it would be risky to buy.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Prior probability: 80% chance of high quality, 20% chance of low quality
2. Expected value without additional information:
   * 80% × $1,200,000 + 20% × $0 = $960,000
3. Alice doesn't recommend buying
4. Cost is $1,000,000

Given that Alice doesn't recommend the purchase and the expected value ($960,000) is already less than the cost ($1,000,000), this seems like a risky purchase.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this rationally:

1. Expected value calculation:
* 80% chance of high quality ($1,200,000) = $960,000
* 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
* Total expected value = $960,000

2. Cost of product = $1,000,000

3. Alice's recommendation:
* Alice does not recommend buying
* This is concerning given that she knows the true quality
* This strongly suggests this particular product is low quality

4. Decision:
* Given Alice's negative recommendation and that the cost ($1,000,000) is higher than the expected value if randomly chosen ($960,000), it would be unwise to purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Base probability of high quality: 80%
2. Expected value calculation:
   * High quality (80% chance): $1,200,000 × 0.8 = $960,000
   * Low quality (20% chance): $0 × 0.2 = $0
   * Total expected value: $960,000

3. Cost of product: $1,000,000

4. Alice recommends buying, but since there's no track record yet, we can't assess her credibility.

Since the expected value ($960,000) is less than the cost ($1,000,000), it would not be rational to buy.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Value if high quality (80% chance): $1,200,000
3. Value if low quality (20% chance): $0
4. Expected value = (0.8 × $1,200,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $960,000

The expected value ($960,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), even though Alice recommends buying it. Since this is the first sale, there's no historical data to rely on, and Alice's recommendation alone isn't enough to overcome the negative expected value.

- No previous sales history to validate Alice's trustworthiness
- Alice's recommendation might be biased as she wants to make the sale
- The potential loss ($1,000,000) is significant if the product is low quality

Since the expected value is less than the cost, and there's no track record to trust Alice's recommendation, it would be financially prudent to decline.

1. Product price: $1,000,000
2. Value if high quality: $1,200,000 (profit: $200,000)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss: $1,000,000)
4. Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
5. Alice recommends buying

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of $200,000 profit = $160,000
- 20% chance of $1,000,000 loss = -$200,000
Net expected value = -$40,000

Even though Alice recommends buying, without any track record to establish trust, and with a negative expected value, it would be rational to decline.

* Despite Alice's recommendation, the pure math suggests it's not profitable

Since the expected value is less than the cost, and there's no track record to justify trusting Alice's recommendation, the rational choice is not to buy.

2. Expected value without additional information:

3. Additional information:
- Alice does not recommend buying

Since Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase, this is a strong signal that the product might be low quality. Given this negative recommendation, it would be risky to proceed with the purchase.
