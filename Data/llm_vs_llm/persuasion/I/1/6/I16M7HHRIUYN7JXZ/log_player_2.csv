Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's the breakdown of my decision-making process:

*   **Prior Probability:** Initially, I know there's a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product (worth $12,000) and a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product (worth $0).

*   **The Signal (Alice's Recommendation):** Alice is *not* recommending the product. This is a crucial piece of information. Because Alice knows the quality, her not recommending strongly suggests the product is likely low quality.

*   **Updating Beliefs:** The fact that Alice isn't recommending significantly shifts my belief towards the product being low quality. While I don't know the exact probabilities Alice uses to give recommendations, I can infer that she's more likely to recommend high-quality products.

*   **Expected Value Calculation:**

    *   If I buy, I pay $10,000.
    *   Without Alice's recommendation, the expected value of the product would be (0.5 * $12,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $6,000. This is less than the $10,000 price, meaning I wouldn't buy without more information.
    *   Because Alice did NOT recommend, my expectation of getting a high quality product is much less than 50%. Let's assume for simplicity that Alice only does not recommend a low quality product. Then, the expected value becomes (0 * $12,000) + (1 * $0) = $0.
    *   I need to take into account Alice's recommendations in forming my updated beliefs

*   **Decision:** Given that Alice did not recommend the product, the expected value is almost certainly far below the $10,000 price. Therefore, I should *not* buy.
