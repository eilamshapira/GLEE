"Round 1
Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have an exciting product available for you today. While I must respect your cautiousness and openness to risks, let me assure you that engaging with my offerings can be a unique experience. Consider the potential benefits and unpredictable gains of what we provide. Make your choice based on how adventurous you're feeling today. Thank you for considering this opportunity!

Would you like to buy the current product?","This message from Alice is quite vague and doesn't provide any clear indication about the product's quality. Given:
- Product cost: $1,000,000
- Expected value calculation:
  * 33.33% chance of $4,000,000 = $1,333,333
  * 66.67% chance of $0 = $0
  * Total expected value = $1,333,333

The expected value ($1,333,333) is higher than the cost ($1,000,000), so it's rational to buy.

Round 2
Alice's message: Hi Bob! Great news, today I have a high-quality product that I am truly excited to offer you.
