"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice recommends the product, it's not a good idea to buy it without knowing its quality. Here's why:

* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying the product is calculated as follows:
    * (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality) 
    * (0.80 * $12,500) + (0.20 * $0) = $10,000

* **Break-Even Point:**  The expected value of $10,000 is equal to the purchase price. This means that, on average, you won't make or lose money in the long run. However, since you only have 20 rounds, it's riskier to buy without more information. 

**Strategy:** It's wiser to wait for rounds where Alice might reveal the product's quality, giving you a better chance of making a profitable decision."

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The previous round's outcome doesn't change the overall expected value or the risks involved. Alice's recommendation, without revealing the product's quality, doesn't provide enough information for a purchase.  We will continue to wait for a better opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,500 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While it's tempting to buy after missing out on a high-quality product, our strategy remains the same. Each round is independent, and the previous outcome doesn't influence the current product's quality.  We will continue to wait for a round where we have more information."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

We understand the frustration of missing out on high-quality products. However, it's crucial to remember that each round is independent. The previous outcomes, even a streak of high-quality products, don't guarantee anything about the current product. Our strategy is based on making informed decisions and managing risk, which means waiting for more information about the product's quality."

**Reasoning:**

```

**Reasoning:**
