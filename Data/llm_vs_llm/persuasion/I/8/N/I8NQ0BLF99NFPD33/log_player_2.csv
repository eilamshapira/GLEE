Alice's message: Hello! I have a fantastic product for sale today. Given the known 50/50 split of high-quality vs. low-quality items, and this being my first sale, consider the value and the known chance. Would you like to make a purchase for $100?

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

- The product costs $100
- A high-quality product is worth $120 to me (profit of $20)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $100)
- There's a 50% chance of each quality
- Expected value = 0.5 × $120 + 0.5 × $0 = $60
- This is less than the $100 price

Since the expected value ($60) is less than the asking price ($100), it would not be rational for me to purchase.

Alice's message: Good day! I've got a product available for $100. While I can't guarantee the quality, based on general market statistics, you have a reasonable chance of receiving a valuable item. It is up to you to decide!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information provided, I need to make a decision about whether to buy the product for $100.

The key points:
- The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $120 to me)
- The product has a 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me)
- The expected value is: 0.5 × $120 + 0.5 × $0 = $60
- The price is $100

Since the expected value ($60) is less than the asking price ($100), it's not a rational economic decision to purchase the product.

Alice's message: Hello! Another product is available for $100. Given my sales history, it's important to recognize that I'm at 0/0 high-quality products sold. Consider whether the possibility of receiving a valuable item, plus the price is worth it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","In this situation, there's no sales history to guide my decision yet, and Alice hasn't actually revealed the quality of my specific product as described in the game rules. All I know is that there's a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $120 (which would give me a $20 profit) and a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product worth $0 (which would give me a $100 loss).

The expected value calculation is: 0.5 × ($120 - $100) + 0.5 × ($0 - $100) = $10 - $50 = -$40

Since the expected value is negative, it's not rational to purchase.

Alice's message: Greetings! I have a product available for $100. I'm starting to build a sales record, so while I have a current record of 0/0 high-quality products sold, the potential is there. It is up to you to decide! 

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the limited information available, let me analyze this decision:

- The product costs $100
- If high quality (50% chance), it's worth $120 (gain of $20)
- If low quality (50% chance), it's worth $0 (loss of $100)
- Expected value: 0.5 × $20 + 0.5 × (-$100) = $10 - $50 = -$40

Since the expected value is negative, and Alice hasn't provided any specific information about the quality of this particular product, the rational choice is to decline.

Alice's message: Good day! I have a product available for $100. My sales record remains at 0/0 high-quality products sold, making this an uncertain purchase. It's a gamble, but one that could potentially pay off. Consider the known statistics and decide!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to carefully think through this decision. 

Alice is offering a product for $100. The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $120 to me) and a 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me).

The expected value of buying is: 0.5 × $120 + 0.5 × $0 = $60

Since the expected value ($60) is less than the price ($100), it wouldn't be rational for me to buy the product without additional information that might change the probability estimates.

Alice hasn't provided any information about the quality of this specific product, and there's no sales history to go by. I'd be taking an unfavorable gamble.

Alice's message: Hello there! Another product is available for $100. My sales record is still at 0/0 high-quality products sold. While the past is no guarantee of the future, I am selling the product at a fair price. It is up to you to decide!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at this situation:

1) Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality
2) High quality is worth $120 to me, low quality is worth $0
3) The product costs $100
4) There's no sales history yet
5) Alice hasn't provided any information about the specific product's quality

The expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of $120 value (high quality) = $60
- 50% chance of $0 value (low quality) = $0
Total expected value = $60

Since the expected value ($60) is less than the cost ($100), it's not rational to purchase without additional information.

The product costs $100.
A high-quality product is worth $120 to me (profit of $20).

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate if buying the product makes sense based on the information provided.

The product costs $100. If it's high quality, it's worth $120 to me (profit of $20). If it's low quality, it's worth $0 (loss of $100).

Alice's message: Good day! I have a product available for $100. Even with my 0/0 record, there's a 50% chance it's a high-quality product. The price is set. What will you do?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at this situation:

- The product costs $100
- If it's high quality (50% chance), it's worth $120 to me (potential $20 gain)

- Expected value: 0.5 × $120 + 0.5 × $0 = $60

- 50% chance of gaining $20 ($120 value - $100 cost)
