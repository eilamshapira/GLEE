"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Price: $100
2. Possible values:
   - High quality (80% chance): Worth $200
   - Low quality (20% chance): Worth $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $200) + (0.2 × $0) = $160

Since the expected value ($160) is greater than the price ($100), and Alice has recommended buying it, it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's previous recommendation was honest and led to a profitable outcome (+$100 profit), which gives some credibility to her recommendations.

The fundamental economics remain the same:
1. Price: $100
2. Possible values:
   - High quality (80% chance): Worth $200
   - Low quality (20% chance): Worth $0

Expected value is still $160 = (0.8 × $200) + (0.2 × $0)

With both the positive expected value and Alice's recommendation (which proved trustworthy in the previous round), it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has been honest with her recommendations for two rounds now, both resulting in profitable purchases (+$100 profit each time).

The base economics remain unchanged:
1. Price: $100
2. Possible values:
   - High quality (80% chance): Worth $200
   - Low quality (20% chance): Worth $0

Expected value is still $160 = (0.8 × $200) + (0.2 × $0)

Given:
- Positive expected value ($160 > $100)
- Alice's consistent track record of honest recommendations
- Alice's continued recommendation to buy

It remains rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Interesting development. Alice's last recommendation led to a loss (-$100), showing she might not always recommend in my best interest.

However, the base economics still hold:
1. Price: $100
2. Possible values:
   - High quality (80% chance): Worth $200
   - Low quality (20% chance): Worth $0

Expected value remains $160 = (0.8 × $200) + (0.2 × $0)

Despite the recent loss:
- Overall record is still positive (2 wins, 1 loss)
- The expected value remains above the purchase price
- The 80% chance of high quality means losses will occasionally happen
- One bad outcome doesn't change the underlying probability

It's still mathematically rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Round 1: High quality (profit +$100)
Round 2: High quality (profit +$100)
Round 3: Low quality (loss -$100)
Round 4: High quality (profit +$100)

The base economics remain:
1. Price: $100
2. Possible values:
   - High quality (80% chance): Worth $200
   - Low quality (20% chance): Worth $0

Expected value is still $160 = (0.8 × $200) + (0.2 × $0)

Our actual results (3 high quality, 1 low quality) are tracking fairly close to the expected 80/20 probability split. With:
- Continued positive expected value
- Overall positive track record
- Results matching theoretical probability

It remains rational to buy.
