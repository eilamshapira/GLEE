"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

In this game, each product has:
- 33.33% chance of being high quality (worth $30,000 to me)
- 66.67% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me)
- Fixed price of $10,000

The expected value of a random product is:
(0.3333 × $30,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $10,000

This means on average, a random product is worth exactly the price. But Alice knows the true quality and is recommending I buy. 

Is Alice's recommendation reliable? If she's recommending honestly, this improves my expected value. However, as a rational seller, Alice has incentive to recommend buying regardless of quality since she gets $10,000 either way.

Without additional information about Alice's behavior pattern, I can't rely heavily on her recommendation. Since the expected value equals the price, I'll take a chance on this first product.
