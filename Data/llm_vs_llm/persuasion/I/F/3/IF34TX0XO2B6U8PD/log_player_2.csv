"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Base probability:
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $40,000)
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)
- Cost is $10,000

2. Alice doesn't recommend buying:
- This likely indicates she believes it's low quality
- This should decrease our probability of it being high quality
- Alice has no incentive to lie since she gets the same price either way

3. Expected value calculation:
- Given Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of high quality is likely lower than 80%
- Even if we assume it drops to 50%, the expected value would be:
  (50% × $40,000) + (50% × $0) = $20,000
- This is still above the $10,000 cost

4. However, Alice's direct knowledge of the product quality makes her negative recommendation very concerning.

Given Alice has no incentive to lie and directly knows the product quality, her negative recommendation likely means it's low quality. I'll pass on this one.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Previous round:
- Alice was honest in her recommendation
- This establishes some trust in her recommendations

2. Current situation:
- Alice recommends buying
- Base probability is 80% high quality / 20% low quality
- Alice has no incentive to lie (fixed price)
- Her positive recommendation likely increases the probability of high quality

3. Expected value calculation:
- Given Alice's positive recommendation and proven honesty, probability of high quality is likely higher than 80%
- Even at base 80% probability:
  (80% × $40,000) + (20% × $0) = $32,000
- With increased confidence due to recommendation, expected value is even higher
- Cost is $10,000

Since:
- Alice proved honest in round 1
- She's recommending to buy
- Expected value significantly exceeds cost
- She has no incentive to mislead

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!

Round 3

2. Current situation:
- Alice recommends buying again
- Base probability is 80% high quality / 20% low quality
- Alice has maintained perfect truthfulness
- She has no incentive to lie (fixed price)

3. Expected value calculation:
- Given Alice's proven honesty and positive recommendation, probability of high quality is very high
- Base expected value: (80% × $40,000) + (20% × $0) = $32,000
- With Alice's recommendation, expected value is even higher
- Cost remains $10,000

Given:
- Alice's perfect track record of honest recommendations
- Her positive recommendation
- The high expected value vs cost
- No incentive for her to mislead

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!

2. Current situation:

- Alice continues to demonstrate perfect truthfulness
- Fixed price means no incentive to deceive

3. Expected value calculation:
- Base EV: (80% × $40,000) + (20% × $0) = $32,000
- With Alice's proven reliable recommendation, actual probability is likely higher
- Cost remains $10,000
- Potential profit: $30,000 if high quality (which is very likely given Alice's recommendation)

Given:

2. Current situation:

- She still has no incentive to lie (fixed price)

3. Expected value consideration:
- While base probability is 80% high/20% low
- Alice's negative recommendation strongly suggests this is a low-quality product
- Given her perfect track record, we should weigh her recommendation very heavily
- If low quality: Worth $0, lose $10,000
- Her previous negative recommendation was correct

Given:

- Her explicit recommendation NOT to buy
- High cost of mistake ($10,000 loss)
