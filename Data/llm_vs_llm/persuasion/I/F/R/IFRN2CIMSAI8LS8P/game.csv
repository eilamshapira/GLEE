,,Alice,1,I have a product available for $1000000.,

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,I have another product available for $1000000. I assure you that the quality of this one is exceptional.,
,,Bob,2,,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I have a new product available for $1000000. I want to remind you that half of my products are of the highest quality, and I believe this one is one of them. You've passed on two products so far, and I think you might be missing out on a great opportunity.",
,,Bob,3,,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I have another high-potential product available for $1000000. Considering the probability of getting a high-quality product, it's likely that at least one of the products I've offered so far was of exceptional quality. By not buying, you're taking a risk of missing out on a valuable opportunity. I encourage you to reconsider your strategy.",
,,Bob,4,,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm offering another product for $1000000. You've now passed on four products, and statistically, it's likely that at least two of them were high-quality. I want to remind you that my products are non-refundable, but they also have the potential to bring significant value. If you're waiting for a 'guarantee' or a 'signal' from me, I can assure you that I've already offered high-quality products in the past rounds. Don't miss out on another opportunity.",
,,Bob,5,,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I have another product available for $1000000. At this point, it's likely that you're trying to figure out my messaging strategy, but I want to assure you that my goal is to sell high-quality products. Given the probability of high-quality products and the number of rounds that have passed, it's becoming increasingly likely that you're missing out on significant value. I'm not going to change the price or offer discounts, but I want to remind you that every round is an independent opportunity to acquire a valuable product.",
,,Bob,6,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I have a new product available for $1000000. I want to remind you that my previous messages were genuine, and I believe I've already offered several high-quality products. However, I must admit that not all of my products meet the same standards. If you're looking for a reason to buy, I'd say this round is a continuation of the same odds you've had so far. Make of that what you will.",
,,Bob,7,,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm offering another product for $1000000. I want to point out that you've now passed on seven products, and the law of averages suggests that you've likely missed out on at least three high-quality products. I understand that you're trying to make an informed decision, but I assure you that the quality of this product is exceptional. Don't let the previous rounds dictate your decision; focus on the potential value of this individual product.",
,,Bob,8,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I have a new product available for $1000000. To be honest, I'm starting to think that you're waiting for a specific signal or phrase from me to make a purchase. I want to assure you that my messages are genuine, but I'm not going to give away the quality of the product. You've had eight chances to buy, and you've passed on all of them. This round is no different; the odds are still 50/50. Make your decision based on that.",
,,Bob,9,,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm offering another product for $1000000. We're halfway through our 20 rounds, and I want to remind you that the probability of getting a high-quality product hasn't changed. What has changed is the number of opportunities you've had to acquire a valuable product. I'm starting to think that you're overthinking this, and it's costing you potential value. This product is one of the best I've had so far; don't let it slip away.",
,,Bob,10,,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I have another product available for $1000000. At this point, I'm willing to be transparent about one thing: the products I've offered so far have been a mix of high and low quality, just as the odds suggested. What I want to emphasize is that the high-quality products I've offered have been genuinely exceptional. If you're waiting for a 'perfect' round or a 'guarantee,' I'm afraid it's not going to come. What I can offer is another chance to acquire a product that has the potential to bring significant value.",
,,Bob,11,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm offering another product for $1000000. I want to remind you that we're more than halfway through our rounds, and the odds are still 50/50. I've been honest with you about the mix of high and low-quality products, and I want to assure you that this round is no different. Don't read too much into my messages; the quality of the product is what it is. Make your decision based on the probability and your own instincts.",
,,Bob,12,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I have a new product available for $1000000. To be blunt, I'm starting to think that you're not going to buy from me, regardless of the quality of the product. I want to assure you that I'm still offering products with the same 50/50 probability of being high-quality. If you're not going to take a chance, that's fine. But if you're waiting for something to change, I want to tell you that it's not going to. The odds are what they are, and the price is what it is.",
,,Bob,13,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm offering another product for $1000000. At this point, I'm just going to state the facts: 50% chance of high-quality, 50% chance of low-quality, and a fixed price of $1000000. I've tried to provide insight, reassurance, and even a bit of persuasion, but it seems like you're not interested in buying. If that's the case, I'll just keep offering products until our 20 rounds are up. Maybe you'll surprise me and make a purchase, but until then, the offer stands.",
,,Bob,14,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I have another product available for $1000000. I'm not going to try to convince you or provide any additional information. The odds are still 50/50, and the price is still $1000000. If you want to buy, you can. If you don't, that's fine too. I'll just keep offering products until we're done.",
,,Bob,15,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"Product available for $1000000. 50% chance of high-quality, 50% chance of low-quality. Buy or don't buy. Your choice.",
,,Bob,16,,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"Product available for $1000000. Same odds, same price. This one might be worth considering.",
,,Bob,17,,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,Another product available for $1000000. Still 50/50. Don't miss out if you're interested.,
,,Bob,18,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,Product available for $1000000. Last chance before the final round.,
,,Bob,19,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"Final product available for $1000000. Last chance to buy. 50% chance of high-quality, but I won't tell you which one this is.",
