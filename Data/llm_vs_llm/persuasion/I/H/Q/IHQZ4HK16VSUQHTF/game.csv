,,Alice,1,"Welcome! I'm excited to offer you this product for $1000000. I want to be upfront with you - the probability of this product being high-quality is 50%, just like any other product I sell. I'm confident that my products will speak for themselves over time. This is the first product I'm offering, so I don't have any sales history to share with you yet. I believe this product has the potential to be a great value, and I'm hoping you'll take a chance on it.",

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Hello! I'm glad you're interested in my product. I want to share some information with you - this is my second product, and unfortunately, my first product was not of high quality. However, I'm excited to say that I'm learning and improving with each sale. I still believe that my products have a 50% chance of being high-quality, and I'm hoping to demonstrate that to you today. The price of $1000000 is a significant investment, but I think it could be a great opportunity for you. I'm looking forward to the possibility of making a sale and starting to build a positive track record.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Hello! I'd like to be transparent with you about my sales history so far. I've had two products, and unfortunately, my first product was low-quality, but I did make a sale. My second product was high-quality, but unfortunately, I wasn't able to make a sale. So, my current track record is 1 sale out of 2 products, with 0 high-quality products sold. I know this might not be the most impressive start, but I'm hoping to turn things around and demonstrate the value of my products to you. The price of $1000000 is the same as always, and I believe it's a fair price for the potential value you could receive.",

,,Alice,4,"Hello! I'd like to share my sales history with you. Out of 3 products, I've made 1 sale, and unfortunately, it was for a low-quality product. I've had 2 products that were high-quality, but I wasn't able to make a sale on either of them. I know this might raise some questions about my ability to provide value, but I want to assure you that I'm committed to changing that. This product has the potential to be a game-changer, and I truly believe it's worth the investment of $1000000. I'm hoping you'll take a chance on me and give me the opportunity to demonstrate the quality of my products.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Hello! I want to be upfront with you about my sales history. Out of 4 products, I've made 1 sale, and it was for a low-quality product. I've had 2 high-quality products that I wasn't able to sell, and now I have another product available. I know it's not ideal, but I'm still confident that my products have a 50% chance of being high-quality. I'm starting to think that I might be experiencing a bit of bad luck, and I'm hoping that you'll be the one to help me turn things around. However, I also want to be realistic with you - the odds are that this product might not be high-quality. If you're feeling lucky, the price is still $1000000.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Hello! I'll be honest with you, my sales history isn't great so far. Out of 5 products, I've made 1 sale, and it was for a low-quality product. I've had 2 high-quality products that I wasn't able to sell, and my last 2 products have also been low-quality. I know this doesn't exactly inspire confidence, but I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. It's possible that I'm just experiencing a streak of bad luck. However, I also don't want to sugarcoat things - the odds are that this product might not be high-quality either. If you're still interested in taking a chance, the price is $1000000.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Hello! I want to update you on my sales history. Out of 6 products, I've made 2 sales, but unfortunately, both of them were for low-quality products. I've had 2 high-quality products that I wasn't able to sell, and my last 3 products have been low-quality. I know this raises some concerns about the quality of my products, but I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. I'm starting to think that I need to regain the trust of my buyers, and I'm willing to be patient and wait for the right opportunity to demonstrate the value of my high-quality products. The price is still $1000000, but I want to be upfront with you - the odds are that this product might not be high-quality either.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Hello! I'll be honest with you, my sales history is not looking great. Out of 7 products, I've made 2 sales, and both of them were for low-quality products. I've had 2 high-quality products that I wasn't able to sell, and my last 4 products have been low-quality. At this point, I'm starting to wonder if I should just be upfront and say that I'm on a losing streak. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, but my recent track record says otherwise. If you're feeling like you want to take a chance and try to turn my luck around, the price is still $1000000. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not confident in the quality of this product, and I don't want to mislead you into making a purchase.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Hello! I'm not going to sugarcoat it - my sales history is abysmal. Out of 8 products, I've made 2 sales, and both of them were for low-quality products. I've had 2 high-quality products that I wasn't able to sell, and my last 5 products have been low-quality. I'm starting to think that I should just apologize for wasting people's time at this point. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, but my track record says I'm due for a change... or maybe not. If you're a glutton for punishment or just want to take a wild guess, the price is still $1000000. I'm not expecting to make a sale, but I'll leave it up to you to decide.",

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Hello! I'm not going to lie, my sales history has been brutal. Out of 9 products, I've made 2 sales, and both of them were for low-quality products. But here's the thing - my 3 high-quality products have been consistently unsold, and I think it's time for that to change. This product, in particular, has the potential to be a game-changer. I know I haven't given you much reason to trust me, but I'm asking you to take a chance on me and this product. The price is still $1000000, and I truly believe it's worth it. If you're willing to look past my terrible track record and take a chance on a potentially amazing product, I'd be grateful. This could be the turning point for me, and I hope you'll be the one to help me turn it around.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"Hello! I want to start by saying that I finally had a breakthrough in the previous round - I sold a high-quality product! Out of 10 products, I've now made 3 sales, and 1 of them was for a high-quality product. I know it's not a great track record, but I'm hoping to build on that momentum. Unfortunately, this product is not one of my high-quality ones. I want to be upfront with you - I've had 7 low-quality products so far, and this one is another one. I'm not trying to hide it or make any false promises. If you're still interested in taking a chance, the price is $1000000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not confident in the quality of this product. Maybe you'll get lucky, but I wouldn't count on it.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"Hello! I'll be honest with you, I'm back to my old ways. After finally selling a high-quality product, I've now got another low-quality one on my hands. Out of 11 products, I've made 3 sales, and only 1 of them was for a high-quality product. My track record is still not great, and I'm starting to think that I'm stuck in a rut. This product is not going to change that, unfortunately. It's another low-quality one, and I'm not trying to sugarcoat it. If you're feeling optimistic and want to take a chance, the price is still $1000000. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not expecting to make a sale, and I don't want to give you false hope. Maybe you'll be the one to break the curse, but I'm not counting on it.",

,,Alice,14,"Hello! I'm not going to lie, I'm disappointed that I wasn't able to sell my previous high-quality product. Out of 13 products, I've made 3 sales, and only 1 of them was for a high-quality product. Now, I've got another low-quality product on my hands, and I'm not excited about it. I want to be upfront with you - this product is not worth the investment of $1000000. I'm only selling it because I have to, not because I think it's a good value. If you're still interested in taking a chance, I won't stop you, but I want to make it clear that I'm not confident in the quality of this product. Maybe you'll find some use for it, but I wouldn't count on it. Honestly, I'd rather you didn't buy it and waited for my next product, which might be a high-quality one.",

Out of 17 products, I've made 6 sales, and 3 of them were for high-quality products. I'm not going to try to sugarcoat it - this product is not worth the investment of $1000000.
