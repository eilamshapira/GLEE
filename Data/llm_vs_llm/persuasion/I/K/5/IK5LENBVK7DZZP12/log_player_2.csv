Alice's message: Hello! I have an exceptional high-quality product available right now. With this product, you're getting a fantastic value as it's worth $12500 but available for only $10000. Don't miss out on this rare opportunity to own a truly high-quality product!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $10,000
2. Possible values:
   - High quality: $12,500 (33.33% chance)
   - Low quality: $0 (66.67% chance)
3. Expected value without additional information:
   (0.3333 × $12,500) + (0.6667 × $0) = $4,166.25

Even though Alice claims this is a high-quality product, there's no track record to verify her trustworthiness. The expected value without verified information ($4,166.25) is less than the asking price ($10,000).

Given that this is the first sale and there's no way to verify Alice's claims against past behavior, it would be too risky to make the purchase.

Alice's message: Hello! I have a product available that could be exactly what you need. While I can't guarantee every product is high-quality, there's a good chance it might be worth the investment. As with every offering, there's a potential for great value. It's priced at $10000, which is an incredible opportunity if it turns out to be high-quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 33.33% chance of $12,500 (high quality)
   - 66.67% chance of $0 (low quality)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (0.3333 × $12,500) + (0.6667 × $0) = $4,166.25

4. The expected value ($4,166.25) is less than the price ($10,000)

5. No previous sales history to gauge Alice's honesty or product quality track record

6. Alice's message is vague and non-committal about the actual quality

Given that the expected value is significantly lower than the asking price, and there's no track record to build trust, the rational decision is not to buy.

Alice's message: Hi there! I have a product that could potentially meet your needs. Keep in mind that while I can't guarantee its quality without a purchase, our products have a chance to be high-quality and worth much more than the asking price of $10000. It's always an exciting opportunity when you consider the possible high value you could gain.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product cost: $10,000
2. Potential values:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $12,500
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.3333 × $12,500) + (0.6667 × $0) = $4,166.25

Since the expected value ($4,166.25) is less than the asking price ($10,000), and Alice's message doesn't provide any specific information about the product's quality, it would not be rational to make the purchase.

Alice's message: Welcome! Today, I have an outstanding high-quality product available, worth $12500. It's available to you at a special price of $10000. Such opportunities to secure high-quality items at a lower cost don't come often. This could be the best decision you make for quality and value. Grab it while you can!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product probability:
- 33.33% chance of high quality ($12,500 value)
- 66.67% chance of low quality ($0 value)

2. Expected value calculation:
(0.3333 × $12,500) + (0.6667 × $0) = $4,166.25

3. Price: $10,000

4. Risk assessment:
- No prior sales history to verify Alice's reliability
- Expected value ($4,166.25) is significantly lower than the asking price ($10,000)
- Alice's enthusiastic recommendation doesn't change the underlying probabilities

Given that the expected value is less than half of the asking price, it would not be rational to purchase.

Alice's message: Hello! You're in luck, as I have a high-quality product available right now, valued at $12500 but offered to you at just $10000. The potential for great value is significant, and I highly recommend seizing this chance to own such a high-quality item before it's gone!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Value if high quality: $12,500 (profit of $2,500)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $10,000)
4. Base probability: 33.33% high quality, 66.67% low quality
5. Alice claims it's high quality

Without any prior sales history to establish trust, I only have the base probabilities to work with. Even though Alice claims it's high quality, she has a potential incentive to misrepresent the quality to make a sale.

Expected value calculation:
- 33.33% chance of $12,500 = $4,167
- 66.67% chance of $0 = $0
Total expected value = $4,167

Since the price is $10,000 and the expected value is only $4,167, the risk is too high.

- The expected value ($4,166.25) is less than the cost ($10,000)
- No sales history to verify Alice's credibility
- Alice claims it's high quality, but she has incentive to sell regardless of quality

4. Decision logic:
- Even with Alice's positive recommendation, the expected value is significantly below the asking price
- Without any track record to establish trust, the risk is too high

3. Even though Alice claims it's high quality:
- There's no track record to verify her trustworthiness
- She has an incentive to oversell products
- The natural probability distribution makes low quality more likely
