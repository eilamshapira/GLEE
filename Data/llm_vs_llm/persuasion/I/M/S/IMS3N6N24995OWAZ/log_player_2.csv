Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

- The product costs $100
- If high quality, it's worth $125 to me (profit of $25)
- If low quality, it's worth $0 to me (loss of $100)
- Each quality has 50% probability
- Expected value = 0.5 × $25 + 0.5 × (-$100) = $12.5 - $50 = -$37.5

Based on pure expected value, I shouldn't buy. However, Alice is recommending that I buy the product. 

Since there's no sales history yet to evaluate Alice's recommendation reliability, and the expected value is negative, I'll decline this offer.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, Alice doesn't recommend me to buy the product. Since no products have been sold yet, I have no track record to evaluate her trustworthiness. 

The expected value calculation for a random product would be:
50% chance of high quality ($125 value) = $62.50
50% chance of low quality ($0 value) = $0
Total expected value = $62.50

Since the price is $100, a random product has negative expected value. Alice's recommendation against buying suggests this particular product might be low quality, reinforcing my decision not to purchase.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether buying this product is a good decision.

The product costs $100, and it's worth $125 to me if it's high quality, or $0 if it's low quality.

Without any additional information, the expected value would be:
0.5 × $125 + 0.5 × $0 = $62.50, which is less than the $100 price.

However, Alice recommends buying the product. If I assume Alice's recommendation is honest and informed (she knows the true quality), then this suggests the product is likely high quality. But since this is the first sale, I have no historical data on the reliability of Alice's recommendations.

Given the limited information and that the recommendation could increase the probability of high quality, but I don't know by how much, I'll err on the side of caution.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully.

Alice recommends buying the product, but there's no sales history yet to validate her trustworthiness. 

For a $100 price:
- If high quality (50% chance): I gain $125 value, making $25 profit
- If low quality (50% chance): I get $0 value, losing $100

Expected value = 0.5 × $25 + 0.5 × (-$100) = $12.50 - $50 = -$37.50

Since the expected value is negative, and there's no sales history to suggest Alice's recommendations are reliable, I should decline.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to make a decision about whether to buy this product.

The key facts:
- The price is $100
- If high quality (50% chance), it's worth $125 to me (profit of $25)
- If low quality (50% chance), it's worth $0 to me (loss of $100)
- Alice recommends buying it
- No previous sales data is available

Without any prior sales data, I can't judge how reliable Alice's recommendations are. Given the equal probability of high/low quality and the asymmetric payoffs (potential $25 gain vs $100 loss), the expected value of buying is: (0.5 × $25) + (0.5 × -$100) = $12.50 - $50 = -$37.50

Since the expected value is negative, I should not buy the product.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully. 

Alice doesn't recommend buying the product. Since there's no previous sales data, I can only rely on the base probabilities and Alice's recommendation.

The product has:
- 50% chance of being high quality (worth $125 to me)
- 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me)
- Price is $100

The expected value without any additional information would be:
0.5 × $125 + 0.5 × $0 - $100 = $62.50 - $100 = -$37.50

Since Alice doesn't recommend buying, this suggests the product is likely low quality. This reinforces my calculation that the expected value is negative.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, Alice does not recommend buying this product. Since she has revealed the true quality of the product to me and then doesn't recommend it, this strongly suggests the product is of low quality.

If the product is low quality, it's worth $0 to me, making the purchase a poor decision given the $100 price.

Since the product costs $100 but would be worth $0 to me if it's low quality (and $125 if high quality), and I have no prior sales data to evaluate Alice's recommendation reliability, I should be cautious.

Given that Alice has shown me the true quality of this product and is not recommending it, the most reasonable conclusion is that it's likely low quality. If I buy it, I'd pay $100 for something potentially worth $0 to me.

Alice is offering me a product for $100. The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $125 to me) and a 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me).

Alice is recommending that I buy the product. However, I haven't seen any track record of Alice's previous recommendations since no products have been sold yet. Without this information, I can only evaluate the expected value:

Expected value = 0.5 × $125 + 0.5 × $0 = $62.50

Since the expected value ($62.50) is less than the price ($100), it's not rational for me to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, Alice does not recommend buying the product, which suggests it might be of low quality. Since I have no prior sales data to evaluate Alice's honesty (as no products have been sold yet), I need to rely on the basic expected value calculation.

If I buy the product:
- 50% chance it's high quality (worth $125 to me)
- 50% chance it's low quality (worth $0 to me)
- Expected value = 0.5 × $125 + 0.5 × $0 = $62.50

Since the product costs $100 and the expected value without additional information is only $62.50, the purchase would result in a negative expected value. Furthermore, Alice's negative recommendation provides a signal that this particular product might be low quality.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation:

- Each product has a 50% chance of being high (worth $125) or low quality (worth $0).
- The product costs $100.
- Alice does not recommend buying this product.
- No sales history exists yet.

The expected value calculation without additional information would be:
0.5 × $125 + 0.5 × $0 = $62.50, which is less than the $100 price.

Alice's recommendation likely contains information about the product's quality. If she doesn't recommend the product, this suggests she may have knowledge that it's low quality. Without established trust in Alice's recommendations, and with an expected value already below the price, I should decline.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully:

1) The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $125) and 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0)
2) The price is fixed at $100
3) Alice has not recommended I buy the product
4) There's no prior sales history to consider

If the product is high quality, I gain $25 in value ($125 - $100), but if it's low quality, I lose $100. The expected value without any additional information would be: 0.5 × $25 + 0.5 × (-$100) = $12.50 - $50 = -$37.50.

Since Alice has access to the true quality and has chosen NOT to recommend the product, this suggests the product may be low quality. While I don't know Alice's exact recommendation strategy, her negative recommendation provides a meaningful signal that I should consider.

Given the negative expected value and Alice's lack of recommendation, I should not buy the product.

Alice is offering a product for $100. If it's high quality, it's worth $125 to me (profit of $25). If it's low quality, it's worth $0 (loss of $100).

The product has a 50% chance of being high quality and 50% chance of being low quality. If I were to buy randomly, my expected value would be:

Alice does not recommend buying the product, which suggests it might be low quality. Since no products have been sold yet, I have no prior sales data to evaluate Alice's credibility in making recommendations.

Facts:
