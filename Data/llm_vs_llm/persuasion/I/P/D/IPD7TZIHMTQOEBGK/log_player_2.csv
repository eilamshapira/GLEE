Alice's message: Hello! I'm offering a fantastic product today. Based on my track record, there's a 50% chance this product is of the highest quality, guaranteeing a great return on your investment. Considering the potential for significant value, I believe this is an excellent opportunity. Are you interested in purchasing it for $100?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Cost of product: $100
2. Potential outcomes:
   - High quality (50% chance): Worth $300 (profit of $200)
   - Low quality (50% chance): Worth $0 (loss of $100)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (50% × $300) + (50% × $0) - $100 = $150 - $100 = $50

The expected value is positive ($50), which means this is mathematically a good investment. There's no previous sales history to consider, but the basic probability makes this a favorable bet.

Alice's message: Good day! I'm excited to present another product today. My previous sale went well, which further strengthens my confidence in this new offering. While the quality is not guaranteed, the potential value is substantial. Considering my history, it's definitely worth considering. Would you like to buy it for $100?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Past record:
- 1 previous buyer
- 1 high-quality product sold (100% success rate so far)

2. Economics:
- Cost: $100
- Potential value: $300 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- 50/50 chance of each quality level
- Expected value = (50% × $300) + (50% × $0) = $150

3. Seller's behavior:
- Alice has maintained a perfect record so far
- Her message seems confident but also honest about the uncertainty
- She references her successful track record

The expected value ($150) is higher than the cost ($100), and Alice's perfect track record, though limited, is encouraging. The risk seems worth taking.

2. The math:
- Cost: $100
