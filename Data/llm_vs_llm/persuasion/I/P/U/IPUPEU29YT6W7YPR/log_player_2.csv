Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the given statistics, Alice has sold only 1 product, and it was not a high-quality product. Alice is recommending that I buy the product, but the previous recommendation resulted in a low-quality product. The product has a 50% chance of being high quality, which means there's also a 50% risk of it being low quality and worth $0. Given that the only sale so far was low quality, and considering the risk of losing $1,000,000 if the product is low quality, it may not be a good decision to buy the product despite Alice's recommendation.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the statistics given:

- 1 product was recommended and purchased previously.
- 0 of them turned out to be high quality, meaning the previous purchased product was low quality.

Given that Alice recommends you buy this product, but the past recommendation to another buyer led to purchasing a low-quality product, there's a risk in trusting the recommendation.

Here's the logical reasoning:
1. Alice recommended previously, and it resulted in a low-quality product.
2. There's no historical instance of a recommended product being high quality from the available data.
3. You value high-quality products significantly more than low-quality ones.

However, without more data, it is challenging to ascertain Aliceâ€™s ability to predict product quality accurately. For this specific decision, given the available data so far, the risk appears quite significant.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the provided statistics, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold despite one purchase suggests that the product the previous buyer purchased was low quality. While Alice recommends buying, the current data indicates a lack of high-quality products among those sold. 

Given the potential value of a high-quality product and the associated risk based on the previous outcome, I will choose cautiously:
