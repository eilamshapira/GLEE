Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The product costs $1,000,000
2. It's worth $1,200,000 if high quality (33.33% chance) or $0 if low quality (66.67% chance)
3. Expected value = (0.3333 × $1,200,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $400,000
4. Alice does not recommend buying
5. Since Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend it, this suggests it's likely low quality
6. The expected value ($400,000) is already less than the price ($1,000,000), and with Alice's negative recommendation, it's even less favorable

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Price = $1,000,000
2. Value if high quality = $1,200,000 (33.33% chance)
3. Value if low quality = $0 (66.67% chance)

Expected value = (0.3333 × $1,200,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $400,000

Since the expected value ($400,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), even with Alice's recommendation, it's not a rational decision to buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Price is $1,000,000
2. If high quality (33.33% chance): worth $1,200,000 (profit of $200,000)
3. If low quality (66.67% chance): worth $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
4. Alice doesn't recommend buying
5. No prior sales history to reference

Expected value calculation:
- 33.33% × $200,000 = $66,660 (potential gain)
- 66.67% × (-$1,000,000) = -$666,700 (potential loss)
Total expected value: -$600,040

1. The expected value is negative
2. Alice doesn't recommend buying
3. No prior history to validate Alice's trustworthiness
