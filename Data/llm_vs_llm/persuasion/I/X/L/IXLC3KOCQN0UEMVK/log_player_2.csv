Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Expected value calculation:
   * 80% chance of high quality ($1,250,000) = $1,000,000
   * 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
   * Total expected value = $1,000,000

3. Seller's recommendation: Positive
4. No prior sales history to reference

The expected value ($1,000,000) equals the asking price ($1,000,000), and Alice's recommendation is positive. While there's still risk, the high probability of getting a high-quality product (80%) makes this a reasonable investment.

2. Expected value calculation:

   * 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
   * Total expected value = $1,000,000

3. Additional information:
   * Alice has made 1 previous sale
   * That sale was a high-quality product
   * Alice is recommending this product

The fact that the previous sale was successful and high-quality, combined with Alice's recommendation and the probability matching the price point, makes this a reasonable purchase.

1. Prior probability of high quality: 80%
2. Value calculation:
   * Expected value = (80% × $1,250,000) + (20% × $0) = $1,000,000
   * Cost = $1,000,000

3. Track record:
   * 2 buyers so far
   * 2 high-quality products sold
   * 100% success rate with recommendations

4. Alice's recommendation is positive

Given that:
- The expected value equals the cost
- Alice has a perfect track record so far
- Alice is recommending the purchase
- The base probability of high quality is good (80%)

The combination of Alice's perfect track record and positive recommendation makes this a favorable opportunity.

1. Prior probability of high quality: 80%
2. Price: $1,000,000
3. Value if high quality: $1,250,000 (profit of $250,000)
4. Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
5. Previous sales data:
   - 3 sales, all high quality (100% success rate)
   - Alice's recommendation has proven reliable

Expected value calculation:
- With 80% chance of high quality and positive track record:
- 0.8 × $250,000 (profit if high quality) + 0.2 × (-$1,000,000) (loss if low quality)
- = $200,000 - $200,000

While the expected value calculation is neutral, Alice's perfect track record and recommendation provide additional confidence. Given these factors, I'll accept the offer.

1. Historical data:
- 4 buyers purchased products
- 4 high-quality products were sold (100% success rate)
- This suggests Alice has been honest in her recommendations

2. Current situation:
- Alice is NOT recommending this product
- Given her perfect track record, this is a strong signal that the product is low quality
- If the product is low quality, it's worth $0 to me
- The price is $1,000,000

3. Risk assessment:
- Even though the base probability is 80% for high quality, Alice's negative recommendation strongly suggests this is a low-quality product
- The potential loss ($1,000,000) is significant compared to the potential gain ($250,000)
- Alice's previous honest recommendations increase the credibility of her current warning

Given Alice's negative recommendation and her trustworthy track record, it would be too risky to purchase this product.

3. Alice's recommendation:
- Alice doesn't recommend buying
- Given she has been honest in previous sales (100% high quality), her negative recommendation should be taken seriously

4. Expected value without recommendation:
- 80% chance of $1,250,000 = $1,000,000
- 20% chance of $0 = $0
- Total = $1,000,000 (same as price)

5. With Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of high quality likely drops significantly below 80%, making the expected value less than the $1,000,000 price.

The historical track record shows perfect accuracy (100% high quality), which aligns with Alice's current positive recommendation. This strengthens my confidence in the product being high quality.

Expected value calculation:
