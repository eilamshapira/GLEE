Alice's message: I want to be upfront with you, Bob. While I don't have any specific information to share about this product, I do want to remind you that not every product can meet the high standards we've seen so far. The 80% probability of a product being high-quality also means there's a 20% chance it might not be.

Round 6
Alice's message: Bob, I want to be honest with you - we've had a good run of high-quality products, but I'm starting to think that you might be getting a little too confident in my offerings. The 80% probability of a product being high-quality is just that - a probability. I'm not making any promises about this particular product, and I want to caution you that it might not live up to your expectations. The price is still $10000, but I want to make sure you're making an informed decision.

Round 7
Alice's message: Bob, I have to say that I'm a bit surprised you've been buying every product I've offered so far, despite my hints about the quality of some of them. I'm starting to think that you might be overpaying for some of these products. That being said, this new product I'm offering is actually a high-quality one, and I think it's worth the $10000 price tag. If you're willing to continue taking the risk, I'm happy to keep offering you products, but I want to make sure you're aware that not every product will be as good as this one.

Round 9
Alice's message: Bob, I think we've established a pattern here. You're buying every product I offer, and I'm happy to keep selling to you. This product is another high-quality one, but to be honest, I don't think that's really a factor in your decision-making process at this point.
