Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my reasoning:

* **Base Probability:** Without any information, there's a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $12,000 and a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product worth $0. The expected value of a random product is (0.3333 * $12,000) + (0.6667 * $0) = $4,000. Since the price is $10,000, I wouldn't buy a product with unknown quality.

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice *doesn't* recommend buying the product. This is strong negative information. It suggests she knows the product is likely low quality.

* **Alice's Sales Record:** The fact that 7 high-quality products have been sold doesn't really influence my decision here. The key is that Alice is *not* recommending this particular product. The earlier sales are independent events.

* **Conclusion:** Given that Alice, who knows the quality, is advising *against* the purchase, and my initial expected value calculation would lead me to not buy, I should decline.
