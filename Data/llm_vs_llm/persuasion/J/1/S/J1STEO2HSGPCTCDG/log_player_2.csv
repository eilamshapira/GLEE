Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my reasoning:

*   **Prior Probability:** Initially, the probability of a high-quality product is 80%.

*   **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending that I buy the product. This is a positive signal, but we need to figure out how informative it is.

*   **Observed Sales Data:** 15 buyers have been offered products, and 12 high-quality products have been sold. This means 3 low-quality products were also sold.

*   **Inference:** Assume Alice only recommends high-quality products. Given that 3 low-quality products were sold, it means that buyers chose to buy against her suggestions three times (or Alice is sometimes wrong.)

Now, let's consider the expected value of buying the product, given Alice's recommendation.

Since Alice recommended the product, let's first assume that she recommends a high-quality product with probability close to 1, and let us further assume that she does so with probability of x and a low-quality product with probability (1-x).

If Alice recommends a product, what is the probability that it is high quality?
We know that a fraction of the 15 products sold were high-quality (12/15). If the recommendation is close to being a true indicator of quality, with some errors, there is high chance that the product is high quality.

However, even with a probability somewhat lower than 1, given a purchase price of $1,000,000, and a value of $4,000,000 if high quality, it is worth it to take the chance. We want to find the threshold probability for the product to be high quality, p, that justifies buying it:

p * $4,000,000 + (1-p) * $0 >= $1,000,000
p >= 1/4 = 0.25.

Thus, as long as the probability is greater than 25%, it is worthwhile. The probability should be significantly greater than 0.25, which is why I will buy it.

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my analysis and decision:

*   **Prior Belief:** Initially, I know there's an 80% chance of a product being high quality.

*   **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product. This is valuable information, but I need to consider her incentives. She wants to sell the product regardless of its quality.

*   **Sales Record:** 16 buyers, 13 high-quality products sold. This means 3 low-quality products were sold. This is an important information.

*   **Bayesian Update (Informal):** Since Alice recommends the purchase, it increases the probability that the product is high quality. The fact that 3 low-quality products have been sold tempers my enthusiasm slightly.

*   **Expected Value Calculation:**

    *   If I buy:
        *   Probability of High Quality (Given Recommendation): This is tricky to calculate precisely without more information about Alice's recommendation strategy. However, given the sales record and her recommendation, I will assume this is slightly more than 80%. For the sake of calculation, I will use 85% as the probability for a high quality product.
        *   Expected Value = (0.85 * $4,000,000) + (0.15 * $0) - $1,000,000 = $3,400,000 - $1,000,000 = $2,400,000

    *   If I don't buy: Expected Value = $0

*   **Decision:** Since the expected value of buying is positive and significant, I will buy the product.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my reasoning:

*   **Prior Probability:** The base chance of a high-quality product is 80%.
*   **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending I buy the product. This is a crucial piece of information. Since Alice knows the quality, her recommendation likely indicates the product is high quality.
*   **Sales Record:** 15 out of 18 products sold were high quality. This information should be considered.
*   **Decision:** Given Alice's recommendation and the sales record, the probability of this particular product being high quality is significantly higher than the base rate. The expected value of buying is likely higher than $1,000,000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my reasoning:

*   **Prior Probability:** Before any information, there's an 80% chance of a high-quality product.
*   **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying. This is crucial information. It suggests that Alice has revealed a high-quality product.
*   **Previous Sales Record:** 15 high-quality products sold out of 19 total sales implies that Alice is more likely to recommend a buy when she has a high-quality product.

Given that Alice is recommending a purchase, the probability of getting a high-quality product is significantly higher than 80%. Therefore, I will proceed with the purchase.
