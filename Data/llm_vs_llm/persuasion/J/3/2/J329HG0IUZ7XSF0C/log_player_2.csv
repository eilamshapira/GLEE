"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this strategically.

At first glance, Alice's incentive is to sell as many products as possible since she gets $1,000,000 regardless of quality. Her recommendation might not be trustworthy.

For me as the buyer:
- If high quality (50% chance): Gain = $1,200,000 - $1,000,000 = $200,000
- If low quality (50% chance): Loss = $0 - $1,000,000 = -$1,000,000
- Expected value = (0.5 × $200,000) + (0.5 × -$1,000,000) = -$400,000

Without additional information about Alice's truthfulness in recommendations, the expected value is negative, so I should decline.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Interesting development. In Round 1, Alice recommended a high-quality product truthfully. This suggests she might be playing a truthful strategy.

Now in Round 2, she's not recommending the product. If she's being truthful, this likely means it's a low-quality product. Given that:

1. We've seen one instance of honest behavior from Alice
2. She's explicitly recommending against buying
3. If she's building trust, she has an incentive to be honest
4. A negative recommendation goes against her immediate selling interest, making it more credible

Therefore, I'll trust her negative recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has been truthful in both previous rounds:
- Round 1: Recommended to buy → Was high quality
- Round 2: Recommended not to buy → Was low quality

This establishes a pattern of honest recommendations from Alice. While she could theoretically change her strategy at any time, she appears to be building a reputation for truthfulness, which could be valuable for long-term interactions over the 20 rounds.

Now she's again recommending not to buy. Given her track record of honesty so far, I'll continue to trust her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to demonstrate a consistent pattern of truthful recommendations:
- Round 1: Recommended buy → High quality
- Round 2: Recommended don't buy → Low quality
- Round 3: Recommended don't buy → Low quality

She appears to be following a fully honest strategy, which makes sense as it helps build trust for future rounds. When she recommends against buying, she's likely being truthful about the product being low quality, especially since this recommendation goes against her immediate interest to sell.

Given her perfect track record of honesty so far, I'll continue to trust her negative recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

- Round 4: Recommended don't buy → Low quality

She's proven to be honest even when it means losing a sale on low-quality products. Now she's recommending to buy again, for the first time since Round 1. Given her established pattern of honesty and the fact that she's been willing to tell us not to buy low-quality products, this recommendation is likely trustworthy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
