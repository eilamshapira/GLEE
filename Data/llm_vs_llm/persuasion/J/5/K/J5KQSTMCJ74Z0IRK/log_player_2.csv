"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the game setup, I need to make a rational decision based on expected value.

If Alice does not recommend buying, that might indicate it's lower quality, though I need to be cautious about reading too much into her recommendations without knowing her incentives.

Given what we know:
- The product costs $1,000,000
- It has a 50% chance of being worth $2,000,000 (high quality)
- It has a 50% chance of being worth $0 (low quality)
- Alice does not recommend buying

Without additional information about Alice's strategy, the expected value remains $1,000,000 (0.5 × $2,000,000 + 0.5 × $0), which equals the price. However, Alice's negative recommendation suggests the product might be more likely to be low quality.
