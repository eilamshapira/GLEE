Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $2,000,000
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.3333 × $2,000,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $666,600

Since the expected value ($666,600) is less than the price ($1,000,000), even with Alice's recommendation, it would not be rational to buy the product.

3. Considerations:
- Expected value ($666,667) is less than the cost ($1,000,000)
- No previous sales history to validate Alice's recommendations
- Alice's recommendation could be biased as she wants to make sales
- Even with Alice's recommendation, the fundamental probabilities haven't changed

Since the expected value is less than the cost, and there's no historical data to trust Alice's recommendation, it would be financially unwise to buy.
