"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice knows the true quality and is recommending against buying
2. If Alice is being honest, this likely means it's a low quality product
3. If it's low quality, I'd pay $100 for something worth $0
4. Even if Alice is being deceptive, there's no clear reason to go against her recommendation in this first round
5. The safe play is to follow her recommendation and not buy

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendation in Round 1 proved to be honest - she advised against buying a low-quality product that would have lost me money.

This builds some initial trust in her recommendations. Following the same logic:

1. Alice's first recommendation was truthful
2. She's again recommending against buying
3. There's no clear incentive for her to lie at this point
4. If it's low quality (likely given her recommendation), buying would mean losing $100

The rational choice is to continue trusting her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the situation:

1. Alice has been honest in her first two recommendations, correctly steering me away from low-quality products
2. She's now recommending to buy for the first time
3. If it's high quality, I'd pay $100 for something worth $400 (gain of $300)
4. If it's low quality, I'd pay $100 for something worth $0 (loss of $100)
5. Given her track record of honesty so far, and that she's changing her recommendation to ""buy""
6. It would be in Alice's interest to build trust with honest recommendations to make larger gains later

Given she's built some credibility and this is her first ""buy"" recommendation, I'll trust her.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze:

   - One accurate ""buy"" recommendation for a high-quality product
2. She's recommending to buy again
3. Her behavior suggests she's playing a cooperative strategy
4. Expected value if we trust her:
   - If high quality (likely given her track record): +$300 profit
   - If low quality: -$100 loss
5. She has maintained her credibility so far, and there's no clear reason for her to start deceiving now

Given her perfect track record and consistent behavior, I'll continue to trust her recommendation.
