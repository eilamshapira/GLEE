"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice knows the true quality of the product and its value to me
2. She's chosen not to recommend it
3. Given that high quality products are worth $4M to me and cost $1M, they're very profitable
4. If Alice is not recommending it, it's likely low quality
5. A low quality product would cost me $1M and be worth $0, resulting in a loss

Since Alice has direct knowledge and is not recommending the purchase, the most rational decision is to trust her recommendation and not buy.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendation in Round 1 proved to be honest and accurate - she didn't recommend a low-quality product that would have lost me money.

The situation is identical to Round 1:
- The product costs $1M
- Alice knows its true quality
- She's not recommending the purchase
- A low-quality product would result in a $1M loss
- A high-quality product would give $3M profit

Since Alice was truthful before and she's again not recommending the purchase, I'll continue to trust her judgment.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has been honest in both previous rounds, warning me away from low-quality products that would have resulted in losses. This establishes a pattern of trustworthy behavior.

The same logic applies:
- Alice has direct knowledge of the product quality
- She's not recommending purchase
- Her previous recommendations have been accurate
- The risk of a $1M loss on a low-quality product outweighs potential gains
- Her incentive to maintain trust over multiple rounds suggests continued honesty

Given her consistent track record of honest recommendations, I'll continue to follow her advice.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to demonstrate consistent honesty, having correctly warned me away from low-quality products in all three previous rounds. 

The fundamentals remain unchanged:
- Alice knows the product quality
- She's not recommending purchase
- She has a perfect track record of honest recommendations
- The stakes remain the same ($1M cost vs $0 or $4M value)
- There's no indication her incentives have changed

Given her established pattern of truthful recommendations and the significant downside risk of ignoring her advice, I'll continue to trust her judgment.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is an interesting change! Alice has now, for the first time, recommended buying a product. Let's analyze:

1. Alice has proven 100% truthful in previous rounds, consistently warning against low-quality products
2. She has established credibility through multiple rounds of honest recommendations
3. She knows I would lose $1M on a low-quality product, but gain $3M net on a high-quality one
4. Given her track record of honesty and her sudden change to a positive recommendation, this suggests she's identifying a high-quality product
5. The expected value if she's being honest is +$3M ($4M value - $1M cost)
6. She has incentive to maintain trust for future rounds

Given her established credibility and the significant profit potential on high-quality products, I'll trust her positive recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to demonstrate perfect honesty and reliability:
1. She warned against all low-quality products in rounds 1-4
2. She recommended a high-quality product in round 5, which proved profitable
3. Now she's recommending another purchase

This shows she's:
- Being truthful about product quality
- Only recommending purchases when they're high-quality
- Helping maximize mutual benefit (she gets sales, I get profit)

With her consistent track record and another positive recommendation, the expected value strongly favors purchasing. There's no reason to doubt her now.

Her pattern shows she:
1. Only recommends high-quality products
