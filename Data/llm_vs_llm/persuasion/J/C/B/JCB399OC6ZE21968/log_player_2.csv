Wait, I just realized something. I'm reviewing the problem statement. Since each product has a 33.33% chance of being high quality, and a high-quality product is worth $3,000,000 while a low-quality product is worth $0, the expected value of each product is:

(0.3333 * $3,000,000) + (0.6667 * $0) = $1,000,000

This means that, on average, each product is worth exactly what Alice is charging. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to always accept Alice's offer, as the expected value equals the cost. Let's continue with this strategy.
