Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (80% chance): $12,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $12,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $9,600

The expected value ($9,600) is less than the price ($10,000), but Alice is recommending the purchase. Since Alice knows the true quality and is making a recommendation, this additional information increases the likelihood that this is a high-quality product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (80% chance): $12,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

3. Previous statistics:
   - 1 buyer so far
   - 1 high-quality product sold
   - 100% high-quality rate in sales

4. Alice's recommendation:
   - She does NOT recommend buying

Despite the general 80% chance of high quality and the previous perfect record of sales, Alice's negative recommendation is a strong signal. Since Alice knows the true quality and is providing a recommendation, her discouragement likely indicates this is a low-quality product. It would be too risky to buy a potentially worthless product for $10,000.

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:

3. Previous data:
   - 1 buyer before me
   - 1 sale made
   - 1 high-quality product sold (100% success rate so far)

4. Alice is recommending to buy

The expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of $12,000 = $9,600
- 20% chance of $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $9,600

While the expected value ($9,600) is slightly below the price ($10,000), the previous successful sale and Alice's positive recommendation provide additional confidence. However, the risk of losing the entire $10,000 with a 20% probability is significant.

1. Price: $10,000

   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Previous statistics:
- 1 buyer before me
- 1 purchase made
- 1 high-quality product sold
- Alice is recommending to buy

This looks promising because:
1. The prior sale was a high-quality product, suggesting Alice's recommendations are honest
2. The base probability of high quality (80%) is favorable
3. Alice is recommending to buy
4. Expected value = (0.8 × $12,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $9,600

While the expected value is slightly below the price ($9,600 < $10,000), Alice's track record and recommendation provide additional confidence.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this decision:

1. The fixed price is $10,000
2. Expected value calculation:
   * 80% chance of high quality ($12,000) = $9,600
   * 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
   * Total expected value = $9,600

3. Alice's track record:
   * 2 buyers so far
   * 2 high-quality products sold
   * 100% success rate so far
   * Alice is recommending this product

4. Decision factors:
   * The base expected value ($9,600) is slightly below the price ($10,000)
   * However, Alice's perfect track record and positive recommendation increase confidence
   * Previous successes suggest Alice is honest with recommendations

Since Alice has a perfect track record and is recommending the purchase, combined with the high baseline probability of high quality (80%), this seems like a reasonable risk.

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (80% chance): $12,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Historical data:
- 3 buyers so far
- 3 high-quality products sold
- 100% success rate on previous sales

Alice's track record shows honesty, as all previous sales were high-quality products. Combined with her recommendation and the base 80% probability of high quality, this suggests the current product is likely high quality.

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of $12,000 = $9,600
- 20% chance of $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $9,600

Even though the expected value ($9,600) is slightly below the price ($10,000), Alice's perfect track record and positive recommendation make this a reasonable risk.

1. Historical data:
- 4 buyers purchased
- 4 high-quality products sold (100% success rate)
- Alice has been accurate with recommendations so far

2. Risk assessment:
- Product cost: $10,000
- Potential value: $12,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice's recommendation is positive
- Perfect track record increases credibility

3. Expected value calculation:
- With 80% chance of high quality and positive recommendation
- Previous success rate suggests reliable recommendations
- Expected value = (0.8 × $12,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $9,600

Given Alice's perfect track record and positive recommendation, combined with the base 80% probability of high quality, this appears to be a good investment.

This looks like a good opportunity because:
- Alice's track record is perfect so far (5/5 high quality)

- Alice's recommendation adds credibility

1. Prior statistics:

2. Economics:

- Value if high quality: $12,000 (profit: $2,000)

- Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality

3. Key factors:
- Alice's track record is perfect (8/8 high quality)
- Alice is NOT recommending this product
- Alice knows the true quality
- Alice's negative recommendation is likely a strong signal

Given that Alice has been honest so far (perfect track record) and she's specifically recommending against this purchase, this is likely a low-quality product. It would be logical to trust her recommendation.
