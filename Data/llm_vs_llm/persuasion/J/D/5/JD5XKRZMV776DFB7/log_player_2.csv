Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Before I make my decision, I want to reconsider my strategy. I understand that the expected value of each product is $100 (0.8 * $125 + 0.2 * $0), which makes it seem like buying every product is a reasonable strategy. However, given that Alice knows the true quality of the product and is making a recommendation based on that knowledge, I should factor in her recommendation.

If Alice recommends the product, it's more likely to be high-quality. If she does not recommend it, it's more likely to be low-quality. Therefore, I will adjust my strategy to only buy products that Alice recommends.

For this round, Alice recommends the product, so my decision is:
```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}

The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 13
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the patterns observed so far, it seems like Alice consistently recommends high-quality products. However, to ensure that my strategy is optimal, I should consider the possibility that Alice might change her strategy or that the pattern might not hold.

Given that the expected value of each product is $100 and Alice's recommendations have been reliable, I will continue to buy products that Alice recommends.

For this round, Alice recommends the product, so my decision is:
```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```
However, I want to reconsider my approach for the remaining rounds. If Alice stops recommending products, I might need to adjust my strategy again. For now, I will continue to follow her recommendations but will be cautious if the pattern changes."

12 * $125 - 13 * $100 - 0 = $300 - $1300 = $200
