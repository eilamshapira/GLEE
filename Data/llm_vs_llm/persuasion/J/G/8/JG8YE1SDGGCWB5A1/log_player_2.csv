"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

- The product costs $1,000,000
- If high quality (50% chance), it's worth $2,000,000 to me (profit of $1,000,000)
- If low quality (50% chance), it's worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000)
- Alice knows the product quality
- Alice has recommended that I buy it

The expected value calculation without considering Alice's recommendation would be:
0.5 × ($2,000,000 - $1,000,000) + 0.5 × ($0 - $1,000,000) = $0

However, Alice has specifically recommended I buy it. Since Alice knows the quality and is making a recommendation, this likely provides additional information. If I assume Alice is acting in good faith and recommending high-quality products, then her recommendation increases the probability that this is a high-quality product, making the purchase worthwhile.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

- The product costs $1,000,000
- If high quality (50% chance), it's worth $2,000,000 to me (profit of $1,000,000)
- If low quality (50% chance), it's worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000)
- Alice knows the product quality
- Alice has specifically recommended that I NOT buy it

In Round 1, Alice recommended buying and the product was indeed high-quality, suggesting her recommendations may be honest. Now she's recommending that I don't buy the product. Since she knows the quality, this strongly suggests this is a low-quality product.

If Alice is giving honest recommendations, then following her advice not to buy would save me from losing $1,000,000 on a low-quality product.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation again:

- The product costs $1,000,000
- If high quality (50% chance), it's worth $2,000,000 to me (profit of $1,000,000)
- If low quality (50% chance), it's worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000)
- Alice knows the product quality
- Alice has recommended that I NOT buy it

So far, Alice's recommendations have been honest:
- Round 1: She recommended buying → Product was high-quality
- Round 2: She recommended not buying → Product was low-quality

This established pattern suggests Alice is being truthful in her recommendations. Since she's recommending not to buy again, this is likely another low-quality product that would result in a $1,000,000 loss.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

- If low quality (50% chance), it's worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000)
- Alice knows the product quality
- Alice has recommended that I buy it

Alice's recommendations have been consistent with the actual product quality in all rounds so far:
- Round 1: She recommended buying → Product was high-quality
- Round 2: She recommended not buying → Product was low-quality
- Round 3: She recommended not buying → Product was low-quality

Given this pattern of honesty, and the fact that Alice is now recommending that I buy this product, it's likely a high-quality product worth $2,000,000, which would give me a $1,000,000 profit.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"

- Round 2: She recommended not buying → Product was low-quality
- Round 3: She recommended not buying → Product was low-quality
- Round 4: She recommended buying → Product was high-quality
