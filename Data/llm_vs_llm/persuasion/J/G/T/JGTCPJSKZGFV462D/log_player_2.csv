Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information provided, I need to evaluate whether to buy this product or not.

I know that:
- The product costs $1,000,000
- A high-quality product is worth $1,250,000 to me (profit of $250,000)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000)
- Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality
- Alice does not recommend that I buy this product

The key piece of information is Alice's recommendation. Since she knows the true quality of the product and is advising against purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If I were to buy it anyway, I would likely lose my $1,000,000 investment.

Without any prior sales history to evaluate Alice's recommendation patterns, I should take her advice at face value.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation:

1) Cost of product: $1,000,000
2) Value to me if high quality: $1,250,000 (profit of $250,000)
3) Value to me if low quality: $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
4) Probability of high quality: 50%
5) Probability of low quality: 50%
6) Alice doesn't recommend buying the product

The expected value calculation would be:
0.5 × $1,250,000 + 0.5 × $0 = $625,000

Since $625,000 < $1,000,000 (the cost), it's not profitable to buy based on prior probabilities alone.

Furthermore, Alice doesn't recommend buying, which suggests she knows it's low quality. Since she has no incentive to lie (she gets $1,000,000 either way), I should take her recommendation seriously.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information provided:

1. The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $1,250,000) and 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0).
2. The price is $1,000,000.
3. Alice does not recommend buying the product.
4. There's no sales history yet to evaluate Alice's trustworthiness.

Since Alice does not recommend the product, it suggests the product might be low quality. Without any prior sales data to assess Alice's honesty, and with the high stakes involved ($1,000,000), it's prudent to follow the seller's recommendation in this case.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze the situation. 

Alice is offering a product for $1,000,000:
- 50% chance it's high quality (worth $1,250,000 to me)
- 50% chance it's low quality (worth $0 to me)
- Expected value = 0.5 × $1,250,000 + 0.5 × $0 = $625,000

Alice has randomly selected a product, seen its quality, and does NOT recommend I buy it. This suggests the product is likely low quality. Since there's no prior sales data and Alice is advising against the purchase, it would be unwise to proceed.

The expected value is already below the asking price even with neutral information, and Alice's negative recommendation makes it even less favorable.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided:

1. The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $1,250,000) and 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0).
2. The expected value is: 0.5 × $1,250,000 + 0.5 × $0 = $625,000
3. The product costs $1,000,000, which is greater than the expected value.
4. Alice does not recommend buying the product, which could indicate it's likely low quality.

Given that Alice does not recommend the product and the expected value is less than the cost, I should decline.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the given information, I need to make a decision about whether to buy the product.

The product costs $1,000,000.
If high quality (50% chance), it's worth $1,250,000 to me.
If low quality (50% chance), it's worth $0 to me.
Alice does not recommend buying this product.

The expected value without any recommendation would be:
0.5 × $1,250,000 + 0.5 × $0 = $625,000

Since this is less than the asking price of $1,000,000, it would not be profitable to buy.

Additionally, Alice does not recommend the purchase, which suggests the product might be low quality. Since there's no past sales history to evaluate Alice's recommendation reliability, I should take her advice into consideration.

3. Products have a 50% chance of being high or low quality
4. Alice does not recommend that I buy the product
5. No sales history is available yet

Without knowing Alice's incentives or the reliability of her recommendation, I need to evaluate based on expected value. If Alice's recommendation is truthful, this suggests the product is likely low quality. The expected value calculation without additional information would be:
(0.5 × $1,250,000) + (0.5 × $0) - $1,000,000 = -$375,000

Since Alice specifically recommends against buying and there's no sales history to evaluate her recommendation patterns, it's prudent to decline.

- It has a 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me)
- Alice recommends buying it

If I make this decision purely on expected value:
- Expected value = 0.5 × $1,250,000 + 0.5 × $0 = $625,000
- This is less than the $1,000,000 price

Since I don't have any prior data on Alice's recommendation reliability, and the expected value calculation shows a negative expected return, I should not buy.

- High-quality product (50% chance) is worth $1,250,000 to me
- Low-quality product (50% chance) is worth $0 to me
- Alice recommends buying the product

The expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of $1,250,000 - $1,000,000 = $250,000 profit
- 50% chance of $0 - $1,000,000 = -$1,000,000 loss
- Expected value: 0.5 × $250,000 + 0.5 × (-$1,000,000) = -$375,000

Alice's recommendation could be strategic, but without any previous sales history to establish her trustworthiness, and with a negative expected value based on the base probabilities, I should decline.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","In this scenario, I need to consider:

1. The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $1,250,000) and 50% chance of low quality (worth $0)
2. The expected value of a random product is: 0.5 × $1,250,000 + 0.5 × $0 = $625,000
3. The price is $1,000,000
4. Alice does not recommend buying the product
5. There's no sales history to learn from

Alice's recommendation against buying suggests she knows the product is low quality. If Alice is being truthful, this would mean the product is worth $0, making it a bad purchase at $1,000,000.

Since the expected value ($625,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), and Alice is recommending against the purchase, I should not buy this product.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to determine if buying the product is a good decision based on the available information.

Given:
- Product price: $1,000,000
- High-quality product value to me: $1,250,000
- Low-quality product value to me: $0
- Probability of high-quality: 50%
- Probability of low-quality: 50%
- Alice recommends buying the product

Without purchase history, I can only rely on Alice's recommendation and the base probabilities. The expected value of a random product is:
(50% × $1,250,000) + (50% × $0) = $625,000

This is less than the $1,000,000 price, so a completely random purchase would be a bad deal.

However, Alice has recommended buying, which could indicate the product is high quality. But without knowing Alice's incentives or recommendation reliability, I don't have enough evidence to overcome the negative expected value.

- Expected value: 0.5 × $250,000 + 0.5 × (-$1,000,000) = -$375,000

Alice recommends buying, but since no products have been sold yet, I have no data on her recommendation reliability. The expected value calculation shows this is not a favorable bet from a purely mathematical standpoint.

3. Alice does not recommend me to buy the product.

Since Alice has revealed the true quality to herself and is not recommending the purchase, this suggests the product is likely low quality. If I buy, my expected value would be negative since the product likely has zero value to me but costs $1,000,000.
