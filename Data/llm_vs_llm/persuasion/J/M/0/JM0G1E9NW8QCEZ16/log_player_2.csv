Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given Alice's recommendation not to buy the product, I need to consider what this implies about the quality.

Since Alice knows the true quality of the product and she's not recommending it, it strongly suggests this is a low-quality product worth $0 to me. If I were to buy it for $100, I would lose money.

While there's no sales history to refer to, the explicit negative recommendation from the seller who knows the quality is a clear signal. Since I want to maximize my expected value, I should decline this purchase.

"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

- The product costs $100
- If high quality, it's worth $200 to me (profit of $100)
- If low quality, it's worth $0 to me (loss of $100)
- Quality is a 50/50 chance without other information
- Alice knows the true quality
- Alice does NOT recommend buying this product

Since Alice knows the true quality and is explicitly recommending against purchase, this suggests the product is likely low quality. If I were to ignore Alice's recommendation and assume a 50/50 chance, my expected value would be ($200 × 0.5) + ($0 × 0.5) - $100 = $0. But with Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of low quality is likely higher than 50%.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

1) The product costs $100
2) If high quality, it's worth $200 to me (profit of $100)
3) If low quality, it's worth $0 to me (loss of $100)
4) Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality
5) Alice knows the product quality
6) Alice recommends I buy the product

Without any sales history, I can't assess Alice's trustworthiness. Alice has an incentive to sell regardless of quality. Her recommendation could be honest or strategic.

The expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of +$100 profit
- 50% chance of -$100 loss
- Expected value: 0.5($100) + 0.5(-$100) = $0

Since the expected value is neutral and I don't have information about Alice's reliability, I'll decline this purchase until I have more data.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information provided, I need to make a decision about buying the product.

The key points:
- The product costs $100
- It's worth $200 if high quality, $0 if low quality
- The probability is 50% for either quality
- Alice knows the true quality
- Alice does not recommend buying this product

The expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of $200 value (high quality) = $100
- 50% chance of $0 value (low quality) = $0
- Total expected value = $100

Since Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying, this suggests the product is likely low quality. If I were to ignore Alice's recommendation, my expected value would equal the price. But with Alice's negative recommendation, the expected value drops below $100.

1) The product costs $100 
2) It has a 50% chance of being worth $200 (high quality) and 50% chance of being worth $0 (low quality)

4) Alice knows the true quality and does NOT recommend buying
5) There's no sales history to reference

Since Alice knows the true quality and is specifically not recommending purchase, this suggests the product is likely low quality. If I buy, I would risk paying $100 for something worth $0.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at this situation:

1. The product costs $100
2. If high quality, it's worth $200 to me (profit of $100)
3. If low quality, it's worth $0 to me (loss of $100)
4. The natural probability is 50% high quality, 50% low quality
5. Alice is recommending that I buy the product
6. There's no sales history yet to evaluate Alice's recommendation patterns

With a 50-50 split of quality and Alice knowing the true quality while recommending I buy, this suggests the product is more likely to be high quality. If I trust Alice's recommendation, my expected value would be positive.

Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 out of the past buyers purchased a product, and 1 high-quality product has been sold. This suggests that Alice has been honest with her recommendations so far, since the buyer who followed her recommendation got a high-quality product.

Since Alice recommends that I buy the current product, and her track record shows honesty in her past recommendation, I will follow her recommendation.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, Alice has sold 2 high-quality products to 2 buyers who followed her recommendations. This suggests that her recommendations have been reliable so far. 

Alice is now recommending that I buy the current product. Given her perfect track record of recommending only high-quality products, and the fact that she knows the true quality of the product, it seems reasonable to trust her recommendation.

If I buy a high-quality product for $100, it would be worth $200 to me, resulting in a net gain of $100. If I buy a low-quality product, it would be worth $0, resulting in a net loss of $100.

3. Alice recommends that I buy the current product
4. So far, 3 buyers have purchased based on Alice's recommendations, and all 3 received high-quality products
5. The expected value calculation: 
   - If I buy: (Probability of high quality × Value) - Price
   - With a perfect track record so far, Alice's recommendation seems reliable

Given that Alice has recommended high-quality products to all previous buyers (3 out of 3), and she's recommending this product to me as well, it appears she's being truthful in her recommendations. This suggests the product is likely high quality.

The expected value of buying would be positive, so:

3. Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality.
4. Alice knows the true quality of each product.

Given that Alice knows the quality and has a perfect record of selling only high-quality products, her recommendation not to buy strongly suggests this product is low quality.
