Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a crucial piece of information. Since she knows the true quality of the product and has a strong incentive to sell, her recommendation not to buy strongly suggests the product is low quality. There is no data to suggest otherwise, making it a high-risk purchase with a 50% chance of losing $100."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since there's no past data, Alice's recommendation is the only information we have.  Alice knows the quality of the product and would recommend buying it only if it's high quality.  While there's a 50/50 chance, the potential reward of $200 outweighs the risk of losing $100."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since she knows the true quality of the product, and she's not recommending it, it's highly likely that the product is low quality.  The fact that only one high-quality product was sold out of one buyer further strengthens the likelihood of a low-quality product."

Here's why:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, which implies she knows it's high quality. 
* **Previous Data:** The previous buyer bought a high-quality product. While this is a small sample size, it suggests Alice is likely to be honest in her recommendations.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the product is low quality (a 50% chance), the worst-case scenario is losing $100. The potential reward is gaining $100 (if it's high quality).  The potential reward outweighs the risk. 

Therefore, it's advantageous to buy the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice recommends buying the product. Since she knows the true quality, this is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality. 
* **Sales record:**  The sales record shows that all products sold so far were high quality.  
* **Expected value:**  While there's still a 50% chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($200) outweighs the risk of a low-quality product ($0). 

Therefore, it's in your best interest to buy the product, given the available information."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:** All previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendations received high-quality products.
* **Alice's Knowledge:** Alice knows the quality of the product and is recommending it. This suggests a high probability of the product being high quality.
* **Potential Gain:** Even if there's a 50% chance of it being low quality, the potential gain of $200 from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $100 on a low-quality one.

**While there's still a risk, the available information strongly suggests a positive outcome. It's a calculated risk worth taking.**"

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice knows the quality of the product and recommends buying it. This suggests the product is likely high quality.
* **Past Performance:** All previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation ended up with a high-quality product. This further strengthens the likelihood of the current product being high quality.
* **Expected Value:**  Given the 50% chance of high/low quality, and the fact Alice's recommendations have been perfect so far, the expected value of buying is:
    * (0.5 * $200) + (0.5 * $0) = $100
    * Since the price is $100, the expected value is neutral, meaning you are not expected to gain or lose money.  However, considering Alice's perfect record, the probability of a high-quality product is likely higher than 50%.

Therefore, based on the available information, buying the product seems like a good decision."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, who knows the true quality, is recommending against the product. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.
* **Past Performance:**  All 7 products sold were high quality. This suggests Alice might be more likely to recommend products when they are high quality. 
* **Risk:**  Since a low-quality product is worth $0 to you, the risk of buying is high. The potential reward of $200 if it's high quality is outweighed by the risk of losing $100 if it's low quality. 

It's best to pass on this product and wait for a better opportunity."
