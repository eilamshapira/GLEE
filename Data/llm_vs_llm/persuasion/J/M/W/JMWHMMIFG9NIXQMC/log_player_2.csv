"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Product price: $100
2. High quality (80% chance): Worth $400
3. Low quality (20% chance): Worth $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320

Since the expected value ($320) is higher than the price ($100), it's rational to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The previous outcome was positive, confirming that the expected value calculation was correct. The same conditions apply for this round:

1. Product price: $100
2. High quality (80% chance): Worth $400
3. Low quality (20% chance): Worth $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320

The expected value ($320) remains higher than the price ($100), so it's still rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The previous two rounds have both resulted in high-quality products, which aligns with the 80% probability. The same expected value calculation still applies:

1. Product price: $100
2. High quality (80% chance): Worth $400
3. Low quality (20% chance): Worth $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320

Since the expected value ($320) continues to be significantly higher than the price ($100), the rational decision is to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","We've had three high-quality products in a row, which is consistent with the 80% probability of high-quality items. The fundamentals haven't changed:

1. Product price: $100
2. High quality (80% chance): Worth $400
3. Low quality (20% chance): Worth $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320

The expected value ($320) is still more than triple the purchase price ($100), making this a positive expected value decision.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","We've now seen four high-quality products in a row. While this is a fortunate streak, the underlying probability remains the same for each independent round:

1. Product price: $100
2. High quality (80% chance): Worth $400
3. Low quality (20% chance): Worth $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320

The expected value ($320) continues to exceed the price ($100) by a significant margin, making it rational to continue buying.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","We've seen five high-quality products in a row, which is actually better than the expected 80% rate. However, due to the independence of each round, the probability remains the same for this new product:

1. Product price: $100
2. High quality (80% chance): Worth $400
3. Low quality (20% chance): Worth $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320

With an expected value of $320 versus a cost of $100, buying continues to be the rational choice, even though we might be ""due"" for a low-quality product soon based on probability.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","We've had an impressive streak of six high-quality products. While it might feel like we're ""pushing our luck,"" each round is independent and the probabilities remain unchanged:

1. Product price: $100
2. High quality (80% chance): Worth $400
3. Low quality (20% chance): Worth $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320

The expected value ($320) is still more than triple the cost ($100). Despite our streak, we should make the same rational decision based on the unchanged probabilities.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","We've now seen seven high-quality products in a row, which is quite remarkable given the 80% probability. However, due to the independence of each round, this past streak doesn't affect the probability of the current product:

1. Product price: $100
2. High quality (80% chance): Worth $400
3. Low quality (20% chance): Worth $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320

Even though we might feel like a low-quality product is ""overdue,"" that would be falling for the gambler's fallacy. The expected value ($320) still significantly exceeds the price ($100), so we should continue buying.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Eight high-quality products in a row is an exceptional streak (the probability of this happening was about 17%). However, for this new round, the probabilities remain unchanged and independent:

1. Product price: $100
2. High quality (80% chance): Worth $400
3. Low quality (20% chance): Worth $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320

Despite the unusually long streak, we must avoid the gambler's fallacy. The expected value ($320) is still significantly higher than the price ($100), making buying the rational choice.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 10
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Nine high-quality products in a row is a remarkably rare streak (about 13.4% chance). However, each round remains independent, and the same probabilities apply:

1. Product price: $100
2. High quality (80% chance): Worth $400
3. Low quality (20% chance): Worth $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320

Even though it might feel like we're ""due"" for a low-quality product, that thinking would be fallacious. The expected value ($320) still far exceeds the price ($100), so we should continue with our rational buying strategy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Ten high-quality products in a row is an incredibly rare streak (about 10.7% chance). However, the key principle remains: each round is independent, with the same probabilities:

1. Product price: $100
2. High quality (80% chance): Worth $400
3. Low quality (20% chance): Worth $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320

Despite the extraordinary streak, we must continue to make decisions based on the unchanging probabilities and expected value. With an expected value of $320 versus a cost of $100, buying remains the rational choice.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 12
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Eleven high-quality products in a row is an extraordinarily rare streak (about 8.6% chance). However, as remarkable as this is, each new round remains independent with the same probabilities:

1. Product price: $100
2. High quality (80% chance): Worth $400
3. Low quality (20% chance): Worth $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320

While it might seem almost impossible that the streak could continue, we must avoid letting that influence our decision. The expected value ($320) still significantly exceeds the price ($100), so buying remains the rational choice.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 13
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Twelve high-quality products in a row is an astonishingly rare streak (about 6.9% chance). However, despite how improbable this sequence has been, each new round remains independent:

1. Product price: $100
2. High quality (80% chance): Worth $400
3. Low quality (20% chance): Worth $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320

No matter how unlikely our current streak is, it has no bearing on this round's probabilities. The expected value ($320) is still more than triple the price ($100), so we should maintain our rational buying strategy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 14
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Thirteen high-quality products in a row is a phenomenally rare streak (about 5.5% chance). But the fundamental principle of independence means this new round has the same probabilities:

1. Product price: $100
2. High quality (80% chance): Worth $400
3. Low quality (20% chance): Worth $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320

Even though our streak defies typical probability expectations, we must resist the temptation to think this affects the current round. The expected value ($320) still far exceeds the price ($100), making buying the rational choice.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 15
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Fourteen high-quality products in a row is an almost unbelievable streak (about 4.4% chance). However, the mathematics of independent probability remains unchanged for this new round:

1. Product price: $100
2. High quality (80% chance): Worth $400
3. Low quality (20% chance): Worth $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320

Despite the extraordinary nature of our streak, it has no bearing on this individual decision. The expected value ($320) still substantially exceeds the price ($100), so we should continue with our rational buying strategy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 16
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Finally we've encountered our first low-quality product after an incredible streak. This brings our actual results more in line with the expected probabilities. For this new round, the same probabilities apply:

1. Product price: $100
2. High quality (80% chance): Worth $400
3. Low quality (20% chance): Worth $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320

Despite just experiencing a loss, each round remains independent. The expected value ($320) still exceeds the price ($100) by a significant margin, so we should continue buying.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 17
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","We've now seen 15 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product out of 16 rounds, which is actually better than the expected 80% rate. For this new round, the same probabilities apply:

1. Product price: $100
2. High quality (80% chance): Worth $400
3. Low quality (20% chance): Worth $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320

Even after experiencing both outcomes (high and low quality), the fundamental expected value calculation remains unchanged. With an expected value of $320 versus a price of $100, buying continues to be the rational choice.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 18
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Our overall results (16 high-quality, 1 low-quality) continue to be better than the stated 80% probability. However, for this new round, the same independent probabilities apply:

1. Product price: $100
2. High quality (80% chance): Worth $400
3. Low quality (20% chance): Worth $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320

With just two rounds remaining after this one, the expected value calculation still strongly favors buying, as $320 expected value is significantly higher than the $100 price.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 19
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","With 17 high-quality and 1 low-quality product so far, we've experienced about a 94% success rate, better than the given 80%. However, for this penultimate round, the same independent probabilities apply:

1. Product price: $100
2. High quality (80% chance): Worth $400
3. Low quality (20% chance): Worth $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320

With only one round remaining after this, the expected value ($320) still strongly exceeds the price ($100), making buying the rational choice.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 20
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","For this final round, our results have been remarkable (18 high-quality, 1 low-quality), but the probabilities for this last independent decision remain the same:

1. Product price: $100
2. High quality (80% chance): Worth $400
3. Low quality (20% chance): Worth $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320

Even on this last round, the math remains clear: the expected value ($320) is more than triple the price ($100). There's no reason to change our strategy for the final decision.
