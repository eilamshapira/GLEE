Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $1,000,000
2. If high quality (50% chance): Worth $1,250,000 (profit of $250,000)
3. If low quality (50% chance): Worth $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
4. No historical data to rely on
5. Alice recommends buying

Expected value calculation:
* 50% × $250,000 (profit if high quality)
* 50% × -$1,000,000 (loss if low quality)
* = $125,000 - $500,000 = -$375,000

Even with Alice's recommendation, the expected value is negative. Without any track record to establish trust in Alice's recommendations, it's too risky.

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50%): $1,250,000
   - Low quality (50%): $0
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $1,250,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $625,000
4. Alice recommends buying
5. No historical data to evaluate Alice's trustworthiness

Since the expected value ($625,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), and there's no historical data to trust Alice's recommendation, it would be financially unwise to buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50% chance): $1,250,000
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0
3. Expected value without additional information: $625,000
4. Alice doesn't recommend buying
5. Since Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying, this suggests the product is likely low quality

Given that Alice doesn't recommend buying and she knows the true quality, it's reasonable to conclude this is likely a low-quality product. If it is low quality, I would lose $1,000,000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. Expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of high quality ($1,250,000) = $625,000
- 50% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $625,000
- Price = $1,000,000

2. Considerations:
- The expected value ($625,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000)
- There's no historical data to judge Alice's honesty
- Although Alice recommends buying, without track record, we can't trust the recommendation
- The downside risk is significant (-$1,000,000 if low quality)

Given that the expected value is lower than the price, and there's no historical data to validate Alice's credibility, it would be too risky to buy.

The seller's recommendation is positive, but with no prior sales history, we can't verify their trustworthiness. The expected value ($625,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), making this a negative expected value proposition.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The product costs $1M
2. If high quality, it's worth $1.25M (profit of $250K)
3. If low quality, it's worth $0 (loss of $1M)
4. Alice knows the true value and doesn't recommend buying
5. No prior sales history to evaluate Alice's truthfulness

Given that Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If it were high quality, Alice would likely recommend it to make the sale.

Taking Alice's recommendation at face value, buying would likely result in a $1M loss.
