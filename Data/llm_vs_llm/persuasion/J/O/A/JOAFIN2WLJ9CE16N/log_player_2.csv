Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to carefully analyze this decision.

Alice is recommending that I buy the product, but I need to consider the expected value:
- If I buy, I pay $10,000
- There's a 33.33% chance the product is worth $12,000 (high quality)
- There's a 66.67% chance the product is worth $0 (low quality)

Expected value = (0.3333 × $12,000) + (0.6667 × $0) - $10,000
Expected value = $4,000 - $10,000 = -$6,000

Since the expected value is negative, and I have no additional information about Alice's credibility (as no products have been sold yet), the rational decision is not to buy.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

The product costs $10,000. If it's high quality, it's worth $12,000 to me (a $2,000 profit). If it's low quality, it's worth $0 (a $10,000 loss).

The base probability is 33.33% high quality and 66.67% low quality. Without any additional information, the expected value would be:
(0.3333 × $12,000) + (0.6667 × $0) - $10,000 = $4,000 - $10,000 = -$6,000

However, Alice is recommending I buy the product. If I assume her recommendation is honest, this would suggest the product is more likely to be high quality. But since there is no sales history yet to establish Alice's trustworthiness or recommendation patterns, I can't put much weight on this recommendation.

Given the negative expected value and the lack of information about Alice's recommendation reliability, I should decline.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully.

Alice recommends buying the product, but I have no previous sales data to assess her credibility since this would be the first sale.

The product costs $10,000. 
- If it's high quality (33.33% chance), it's worth $12,000 to me, giving me a $2,000 profit.
- If it's low quality (66.67% chance), it's worth $0 to me, resulting in a $10,000 loss.

Expected value calculation:
(0.3333 × $2,000) + (0.6667 × -$10,000) = $666.60 - $6,667 = -$6,000.40

Since the expected value is negative, it's not mathematically favorable to buy.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation carefully:

1) Product price: $10,000
2) If high quality (33.33% chance): worth $12,000 to me (profit of $2,000)
3) If low quality (66.67% chance): worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)

Expected value calculation:
0.3333 × $2,000 + 0.6667 × (-$10,000) = $666.60 - $6,667 = -$6,000.40

Based on the base probabilities alone, this would be a negative expected value purchase.

Alice has recommended I buy the product, which could suggest it's high quality. However, with no previous sales history to establish Alice's recommendation credibility, I don't have enough information to determine if her recommendation is reliable or if she always recommends buying regardless of quality.

Given the negative expected value and insufficient information about the reliability of Alice's recommendations, I'll decline this purchase.

- If it's high quality, it's worth $12,000 to me (profit of $2,000)

Expected value without Alice's recommendation:

However, Alice is recommending I buy it. This could mean it's more likely to be high quality, but I don't have any track record to judge Alice's recommendation reliability.

Without more information about Alice's incentives or past recommendation accuracy, I should rely on the prior probabilities, which suggest the expected value is negative.
