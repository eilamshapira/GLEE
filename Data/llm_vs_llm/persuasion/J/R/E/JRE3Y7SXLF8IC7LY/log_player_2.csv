"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this strategically.

Alice knows the true quality and knows my valuation. She makes more money if I buy ($100) than if I don't buy ($0), regardless of quality.

Therefore, Alice has an incentive to recommend buying even for low-quality products, so her recommendation isn't necessarily trustworthy.

The expected value calculation:
- 33.33% chance of high quality ($120) = $40
- 66.67% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
Total expected value = $40

Since the price is $100 and expected value is only $40, I shouldn't buy.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $120 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is interesting. In the last round, Alice recommended a high-quality product truthfully.

Now she's recommending against buying. Given that:
1. She makes money when I buy ($100) and nothing when I don't
2. She's actively recommending against her own financial interest
3. She knows the true quality

This strongly suggests she's being honest and the product is low quality. If it were high quality, she would have an incentive to recommend buying it.

Therefore, I'll trust her negative recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","So far, Alice has been honest in both rounds:
- Round 1: Recommended buying a high-quality product
- Round 2: Recommended against buying a low-quality product

She's showing a pattern of honesty, even when it goes against her immediate financial interest. When she recommends against buying (like now), it's particularly credible because:
1. She loses potential profit by discouraging a sale
2. She has demonstrated honesty in previous rounds
3. She's been accurate about both positive and negative recommendations

Given this track record and the fact that she's again recommending against buying, I'll trust her judgment.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to demonstrate a consistent pattern of honesty:
- Round 1: Truthful about high quality
- Round 2: Truthful about low quality
- Round 3: Truthful about low quality

She appears to be building a reputation for trustworthy recommendations, even when it means losing potential sales. This suggests she might be playing a long-term strategy where building trust is more valuable than making immediate sales.

Given that:
1. She has been honest in all three previous rounds
2. She's again recommending against buying
3. She continues to act against her immediate financial interest when the product is low quality

I will continue to trust her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has maintained perfect honesty through four rounds:
1. Truthful about high quality (Round 1)
2-4. Truthful about low quality (Rounds 2-4)

She's clearly demonstrating a commitment to honest recommendations, even though she could make $100 by recommending every product. This suggests she's prioritizing long-term credibility over short-term profits.

When she recommends against buying (like now):
1. She continues to act against her immediate financial interest
2. She has proven completely reliable in similar situations
3. There's no indication her strategy has changed

Given her perfect track record and consistent behavior, I'll continue to trust her negative recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has maintained perfect honesty through five rounds:
1. One truthful high-quality recommendation
2-5. Four truthful low-quality warnings

Her strategy appears to be building a reputation as a trustworthy seller by being completely honest about product quality, even when it means losing sales. This makes sense as a long-term strategy because:
1. It helps me avoid bad purchases (which builds trust)
2. When she does recommend buying, I'll be more likely to trust her
3. This could lead to more profitable transactions overall

Given that she's continuing to recommend against buying, and she has shown no reason to doubt her honesty, I'll continue to trust her judgment.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues her pattern of complete honesty through six rounds:
1. One truthful high-quality recommendation
2-6. Five truthful low-quality warnings

Her strategy is remarkably consistent. By warning against buying low-quality products:
1. She's repeatedly sacrificing immediate $100 profits
2. She's maintaining perfect credibility
3. She's protecting me from bad purchases
4. She's likely expecting this trust to be valuable when she does find high-quality products to recommend

Since she's again recommending against buying, and has given no reason to doubt her honesty through six consecutive rounds, I'll continue to trust her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's record of honesty continues through seven rounds:
1. One truthful high-quality recommendation
2-7. Six truthful low-quality warnings

The pattern remains remarkably consistent. She is clearly demonstrating that:
1. She values long-term trust over short-term profits
2. She's willing to be honest about low-quality products even though it costs her money
3. Her recommendations have been 100% reliable so far
4. She's protecting my interests by preventing me from making bad purchases

With another negative recommendation and no reason to doubt her established trustworthiness, I'll continue following her advice.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has maintained perfect honesty through eight rounds:
1. One truthful high-quality recommendation
2-8. Seven truthful low-quality warnings

This consistent pattern strongly suggests that:
1. She has committed to a long-term strategy of complete honesty
2. She's willing to forgo significant immediate profits ($700 so far from low-quality items)
3. She wants to maintain credibility for when she does find high-quality products
4. Her recommendations are proving to be completely reliable indicators of product quality

Given another negative recommendation and her perfect track record of honesty, there's no reason to deviate from trusting her judgment.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 10
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has now shown perfect honesty through nine rounds:
1. One truthful high-quality recommendation
2-9. Eight truthful low-quality warnings

The pattern is remarkably stable:
1. She continues to prioritize honesty over immediate profits
2. She's now foregone $800 in potential profits from low-quality items
3. Her recommendations have been 100% accurate
4. She's consistently protecting me from making value-losing purchases

While we're seeing an unusually long string of low-quality products, this is statistically possible given the 66.67% chance of low quality. Given her continued negative recommendation and unblemished record of honesty, I'll continue to trust her.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 11
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has maintained perfect honesty through ten rounds:
1. One truthful high-quality recommendation
2-10. Nine truthful low-quality warnings

Even though this is a surprisingly long streak of low-quality products, Alice's behavior remains completely consistent:
1. She continues to sacrifice immediate profits for honesty
2. She's now foregone $900 in potential profits from low-quality items
3. Her recommendations remain 100% accurate
4. She shows no signs of changing her trustworthy strategy

While we might expect to see more high-quality products given the 33.33% probability, random sequences can produce long streaks. Given Alice's continued perfect track record and negative recommendation, I'll continue to trust her.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 12
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Finally, Alice is recommending a purchase again! Let's analyze:

1. She has been perfectly honest for 11 straight rounds:
   - 1 truthful high-quality recommendation
   - 10 truthful low-quality warnings
2. She has consistently sacrificed immediate profits ($1000 total) to maintain credibility
3. She has never once misled me
4. We've had a long streak of low-quality products, so statistically we're ""due"" for a high-quality one
5. Most importantly, she has only recommended buying when the product was actually high-quality (Round 1)

Given her perfect track record of honesty and the fact that she's finally making a positive recommendation after many negative ones, I believe this is very likely to be a high-quality product.

"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $120 for you.

1. She only recommends buying when it's truly beneficial for me
2. She consistently warns against bad purchases
