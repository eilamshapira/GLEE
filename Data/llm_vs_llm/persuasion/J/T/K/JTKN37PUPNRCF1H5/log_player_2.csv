Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (80%): $12,000
   - Low quality (20%): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $12,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $9,600

Since the expected value ($9,600) is less than the price ($10,000), and there's no previous sales history to build trust, it would be risky to buy the product even with Alice's recommendation.

"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Value: $12,000 if high quality, $0 if low quality
3. Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
4. Alice doesn't recommend buying
5. No previous sales history to reference

Given that Alice knows the true value to me and doesn't recommend buying, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If it were high quality, Alice would likely recommend it since she knows it would benefit me.

The seller's negative recommendation outweighs the general 80% probability of high quality. If it's low quality, I would lose my entire $10,000 investment.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Prior probability of high quality: 80%
2. Price: $10,000
3. Expected value calculation:
   * High quality (80%): $12,000 × 0.8 = $9,600
   * Low quality (20%): $0 × 0.2 = $0
   * Total expected value: $9,600

4. Alice recommends buying, which could be a positive signal
5. No historical data to validate Alice's trustworthiness
6. Expected value ($9,600) is less than the price ($10,000)

Based on the expected value being less than the price, even with Alice's recommendation, it would be rational to decline.

Even with Alice's recommendation, the expected value ($9,600) is less than the price ($10,000), making this a mathematically unfavorable deal.

However, Alice's negative recommendation despite having an incentive to sell suggests this might be a low-quality product. Given she knows the true quality and is warning against purchase, it would be wise to trust her recommendation.

Given that Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying, this is a strong signal that the product might be low quality. Since a low-quality product would result in a $10,000 loss, and Alice has no incentive to lie (as her price is fixed), I should trust her recommendation.
