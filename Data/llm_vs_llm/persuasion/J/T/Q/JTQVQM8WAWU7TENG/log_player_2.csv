"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this rationally:

1. Price: $10,000
2. If high quality: Worth $12,000 (profit of $2,000)
3. If low quality: Worth $0 (loss of $10,000)
4. Base probability: 50% for each quality level
5. Expected value without considering Alice's recommendation:
   (50% × $12,000) + (50% × $0) - $10,000 = $6,000 - $10,000 = -$4,000

Even with Alice's recommendation, since this is the first round, I don't know if her recommendations are reliable. Given that the base expected value is negative, I should be cautious.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Interesting - in Round 1, Alice recommended a genuinely high-quality product. This provides one data point suggesting her recommendations might be honest.

However, let's still think carefully:
1. We've seen 1 honest recommendation out of 1 total recommendation
2. The risk/reward ratio is still significant:
   - Potential gain: $2,000 (if high quality)
   - Potential loss: $10,000 (if low quality)
3. One truthful recommendation isn't enough to fully trust the system
4. However, if Alice is being consistently honest, missing these opportunities is costly

Given that Alice's first recommendation was honest and she's recommending again, I'll take a calculated risk this time.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is getting interesting:
1. Alice has now given 2 honest recommendations out of 2
2. Both recommended products were high quality
3. Pattern so far suggests Alice might be truthfully recommending only high-quality products
4. If this pattern holds true, following her recommendations would be profitable:
   - Cost: $10,000
   - Value: $12,000
   - Profit per transaction: $2,000

Given that Alice has built up some credibility with two honest recommendations in a row, and seems to be selectively recommending high-quality products, I'll continue to trust her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is a crucial development:
1. Alice's previous recommendations:
   - Round 1: Recommended, was high quality (I declined)
   - Round 2: Recommended, was high quality (I profited)
   - Round 3: Recommended, was low quality (I lost)
2. Now she's NOT recommending the product
3. This is our first time seeing a non-recommendation
4. The pattern suggests she might be trying to regain trust by being honest about a low-quality product

Given that:
- She's explicitly NOT recommending this one
- We just got burned on a recommended product
- The base expected value is negative
- She might be trying to rebuild credibility

I'll trust her non-recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the pattern so far:
1. When Alice recommends:
   - 2 were high quality (profitable)
   - 1 was low quality (loss)
2. When Alice doesn't recommend:
   - 1 was low quality (good call not to buy)
3. Her one non-recommendation so far was honest
4. The base expected value without recommendation is still negative (-$4,000)
5. She seems to be somewhat truthful with non-recommendations

Since:
- She's again explicitly NOT recommending
- Her previous non-recommendation was honest about a low-quality product
- There's no upside to ignoring a negative recommendation given the baseline negative expected value

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the updated pattern:
1. When Alice recommends:
   - 2 were high quality (profitable)
   - 1 was low quality (loss)
   - Success rate: 67%
2. When Alice doesn't recommend:
   - 2 were low quality (both good calls)
   - Success rate: 100%

Her non-recommendations have been reliable (correctly identifying low-quality products). Her recommendations have been mostly but not completely reliable.

However:
- She seems to be building a pattern of honest non-recommendations
- This positive recommendation comes after two honest non-recommendations
- This might be an attempt to rebuild trust after the previous bad recommendation

Given that her non-recommendations have been consistently honest, and she's choosing to recommend this one, I'll take the risk.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

   - 1 was low quality (loss)
   - Success rate: 75%
2. When Alice doesn't recommend:
   - 2 were low quality (good calls)
   - Success rate: 100%

Her pattern is becoming clearer:
- Her non-recommendations have been consistently honest (2/2 correct)
- She seems to be genuinely warning us about low-quality products
- The last recommendation was honest (high quality)
- She's maintaining credibility with her non-recommendations

Given that:
- All her non-recommendations so far have correctly identified low-quality products
- The base expected value is negative without reliable information
- She's building a consistent pattern of honest non-recommendations

The pattern continues to be very clear:

- She seems to be genuinely warning us about low-quality products
- There's no instance yet where she didn't recommend a high-quality product
- Her non-recommendations are proving to be a very reliable signal

The pattern remains extremely consistent:
- Her non-recommendations continue to be perfectly reliable (4/4 correct)
- She has correctly identified every low-quality product so far
- This consistent pattern suggests a reliable strategy from Alice
- There's still no case where she failed to warn about a low-quality product

- We just saw 5 consecutive non-recommendations, all correctly identifying low-quality products
- Now she's switching to a recommendation
- Her recommendations have been mostly reliable (75% success)

The pattern is getting even stronger:
- Her last recommendation was honest (high quality)
- Her recommendation success rate has improved to 80%
- She maintains perfect accuracy on non-recommendations
- She seems to be very selective about when she recommends

Given:
- Her recommendations are proving increasingly reliable

  (80% × $12,000) + (20% × $0) - $10,000 = $9,600 - $10,000 = -$400
