Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The product costs $1M
2. If high quality, I gain $3M (profit of $2M)
3. If low quality, I gain $0 (loss of $1M)
4. Alice doesn't recommend buying
5. No prior sales history to evaluate Alice's truthfulness

Given that Alice has no incentive to lie (as a rational seller would want to sell), her negative recommendation likely means this is a low-quality product. If it was high quality, she would want to sell it.

Therefore, I'll trust her recommendation.

"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The base probability is 50% high quality, 50% low quality
2. Expected value without additional information would be: (50% × $3M) + (50% × $0) = $1.5M
3. Alice doesn't recommend buying
4. Price is $1M
5. Alice has no track record yet to establish credibility
6. Alice's recommendation against buying likely indicates it's low quality
7. Given Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of high quality is likely lower than 50%

Since Alice doesn't recommend buying and this would lower the expected value below $1.5M (likely below the $1M price), I should decline.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 50% chance of $3,000,000 (high quality)
   - 50% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $3,000,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $1,500,000
4. Alice recommends buying the product
5. No prior sales history to reference

The expected value ($1,500,000) is higher than the price ($1,000,000), and Alice recommends buying. While there's no sales history to validate Alice's trustworthiness, the pure mathematics suggest this is a positive expected value proposition.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The fixed price is $1,000,000
2. The potential value is either:
   - High quality: $3,000,000 (50% chance)
   - Low quality: $0 (50% chance)
3. Alice's track record:
   - 1 previous buyer
   - 1 sale made
   - 100% high-quality products sold so far
4. Alice does NOT recommend buying this product

Given that Alice has only sold high-quality products so far and is now explicitly not recommending this product, this strongly suggests the current product is low quality. If I buy a low-quality product, I would lose my entire $1,000,000 investment.

4. Alice's recommendation: Negative

Alice's negative recommendation and track record suggest:

- Her negative recommendation likely means this is a low-quality product
- Given her track record of honesty, it would be risky to go against her recommendation

Expected value calculation with negative recommendation:
The probability of getting a low-quality product is very high, making the expected value less than the $1,000,000 price.

- If high quality (unlikely based on recommendation): Gain = $2,000,000 ($3M - $1M)
- If low quality (more likely): Loss = -$1,000,000 ($0 - $1M)
- Given Alice's lack of recommendation and her apparent honesty in previous sales, the risk of a low-quality product is high
