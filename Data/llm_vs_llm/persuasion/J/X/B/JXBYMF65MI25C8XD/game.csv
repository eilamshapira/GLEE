,,Alice,18,"Back to reality, I'm afraid. This round's product is a bit of a disappointment, and I don't think it's up to the standards of the last product you purchased. It's got some issues and I'm not confident it's worth the $100 price tag. I want to be honest with you, so I'd advise caution on this one. Maybe wait for the next round to see if I can do better.",

I want to be upfront with you, so I'll just say that I wouldn't recommend this one. You've made some great purchases throughout our 20 rounds, and I think it's best to just stick with what you've got. Thanks for doing business with me, Bob!",
