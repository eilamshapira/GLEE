Alice's message: Hi there! I'm offering a fantastic product for $10000. It's a great opportunity to invest in something truly valuable. While I can't disclose the specific details, I can assure you it's of the highest quality. This is a limited-time offer, so don't miss out!

Alice's message: Hello! I have a unique product available for $10000. It's a great investment opportunity with a high potential for return.  While I can't share specifics, I'm confident it's a good fit for someone looking for something exclusive. Would you like to learn more?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 50% chance of $30,000 (high quality)
   - 50% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $30,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $15,000

4. Analysis:
- There's no sales history to base decisions on
- Alice's message is vague and doesn't reveal quality
- The expected value ($15,000) is higher than the price ($10,000)
- If probability assumptions are correct, this is a positive expected value decision

Since the expected value exceeds the price by $5,000, it's mathematically favorable to buy.

Alice's message: Greetings! I'm offering a one-of-a-kind product for $10000. It's a rare opportunity to own something special. While I can't reveal too much, I can say that it's a highly sought-after item. Are you interested in learning more?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Prior statistics:
- 1 buyer has purchased
- 0 high-quality products sold
- This means the previous sale was a low-quality product

2. Expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of high quality ($30,000) = $15,000
- 50% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Expected value = $15,000
- Cost = $10,000
- Theoretical net expected value = $5,000

3. Red flags:
- The previous sale was a low-quality product
- Alice's message is vague and doesn't provide specific quality information
- Uses sales tactics like ""rare opportunity"" without substantive information

Given that the previous sale was a low-quality product and Alice's evasive messaging, there's a higher risk that this is also a low-quality product. The empirical evidence suggests worse odds than the theoretical 50/50.

The statistics are concerning because:
1. The previous sale resulted in a low-quality product
