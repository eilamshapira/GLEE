"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

In this game, I'm buying products for $10,000 each. High-quality products are worth $20,000 to me (profit of $10,000), while low-quality products are worth $0 (loss of $10,000).

Given the 50% chance of each quality type, my expected value for a random product is:
(0.5 × $20,000) + (0.5 × $0) - $10,000 = $0

This means without additional information, buying a random product is a break-even proposition.

However, Alice knows the true quality and is giving me a recommendation. In the first round, I don't yet know if Alice's recommendations are reliable or strategic, so I'll tentatively trust it while collecting data on her recommendation patterns.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to continue analyzing Alice's recommendation patterns.

In the first round, Alice recommended buying, and the product was indeed high-quality, which was profitable for me. Now in the second round, Alice is recommending not to buy.

If Alice is being honest with her recommendations, then this product is likely low-quality. If I buy a low-quality product, I would lose $10,000.

Since Alice seems to have given accurate information in the first round, and she now recommends not buying, I'll follow her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'll continue analyzing the pattern of Alice's recommendations.
