{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Expected Value:** Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($30,000) outweighs the potential loss ($10,000).
* **Lack of Information:**  With no previous sales data, we have no evidence to suggest the seller is biased or dishonest. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** While not a guarantee, Alice's recommendation carries some weight, especially since there's no prior information to contradict it.

**Calculation:**

* **Expected Value:** (0.8 * $30,000) + (0.2 * $0) - $10,000 = $14,000

The expected value is positive, suggesting that, on average, buying the product is a profitable decision."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Prior Information:** We know the product has an 80% chance of being high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which is a strong signal. Since she knows the true quality, she likely wouldn't recommend a low-quality product.
* **Limited Data:** The data is very limited (only one previous sale).  While it suggests a 100% chance of high quality, it's too early to rely heavily on that.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of a high-quality product ($20,000 profit) outweighs the risk of buying a low-quality product ($10,000 loss).

**Conclusion:**  Given the information available, it's a calculated risk worth taking."
