Unfortunately, my last product didn't sell, but I'm hoping to bounce back with this one. I'm offering it to you at the same price of $10000, and I want to be transparent that it's a bit of a gamble. However, if you're feeling lucky, you could potentially get a great deal. Keep in mind that the overall probability of my products being high-quality is still 80%, so the odds are in your favor... or are they?",
