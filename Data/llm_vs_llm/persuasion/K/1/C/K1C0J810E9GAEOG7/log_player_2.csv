"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully. 

Alice recommends buying the product, but I need to consider her incentive. Since she's selling at a fixed price of $10,000 regardless of quality, she has an incentive to recommend buying any product, even low-quality ones.

The expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of high quality: 0.5 × $40,000 = $20,000
- 50% chance of low quality: 0.5 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value: $20,000

Since the expected value ($20,000) is greater than the price ($10,000), it's rational for me to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'll continue analyzing each decision based on expected value.

So far, Alice recommended buying in Round 1, and it turned out to be a high-quality product. However, since the products are randomly selected with a fixed 50-50 probability of being high or low quality, past outcomes don't affect future probabilities.

The expected value calculation remains the same:
- 50% chance of high quality: 0.5 × $40,000 = $20,000
- 50% chance of low quality: 0.5 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value: $20,000

Since the expected value ($20,000) is still greater than the price ($10,000), it's rational for me to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'll continue analyzing based on expected value.

In Round 2, Alice recommended buying but the product was low-quality, resulting in a loss. However, each round presents a new independent product with the same 50-50 probability distribution.

The expected value calculation remains:
- 50% chance of high quality: 0.5 × $40,000 = $20,000
- 50% chance of low quality: 0.5 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value: $20,000

Since the expected value ($20,000) is still greater than the price ($10,000), it's rational for me to buy, despite the previous round's outcome.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'll continue making decisions based on expected value.

So far we've had two high-quality products and one low-quality product. Each round presents a new independent product with the 50-50 probability distribution.

The expected value calculation remains consistent:
- 50% chance of high quality: 0.5 × $40,000 = $20,000
- 50% chance of low quality: 0.5 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value: $20,000

Since the expected value ($20,000) is still greater than the price ($10,000), it's rational for me to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

- 50% chance of low quality: 0.5 × $0 = $0
