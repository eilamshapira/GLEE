,,Alice,8,"Hello! I'm offering this product for $1000000. I understand you're aware that 33.33% of my products are high-quality (worth $3000000) and 66.67% are low-quality. I haven't made any sales yet, which I know might make you hesitant. The challenge I face is that without a track record, it's difficult to establish trust. However, I want to be straightforward - every buyer faces the same statistical opportunity with an expected value around the asking price. I'm committed to building a reputable business over time.

,,Alice,9,"Hello! I'm offering this product for $1000000. I understand we're in a challenging market situation - you know that 33.33% of products are high-quality (worth $3000000) and 66.67% are low-quality, but without any sales history, it's difficult to establish credibility. I recognize the dilemma: buyers are understandably cautious without proven track record, yet I can't build that record without initial sales. From a purely mathematical perspective, the expected value is still $1000000, matching the price. I'm committed to operating honestly in this market for the long term. Each purchase represents an independent opportunity with the same statistical value proposition. I appreciate your consideration and understand if you prefer to wait for sellers with established reputations.",

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Hello! I'm offering this product for $1000000. I want to be completely transparent with you - this is genuinely a high-quality product worth $3000000. I understand your potential skepticism since I haven't made any sales yet, creating a classic 'cold start' problem in this market. Without a track record, it's difficult to establish trust, yet I need initial sales to build that reputation. What I can tell you is that this particular product represents the 33.33% high-quality category, offering exceptional value at three times the asking price. I'm passionate about building a sustainable business based on honest representation. This is a genuine opportunity to gain substantial value. Would you consider being among my first customers with this truly premium product?",

,,Alice,11,"Hello! I'm offering this product for $1000000. I understand we're facing what economists call a 'market for lemons' problem - without established trust, it's rational for buyers to be cautious. I haven't made any sales yet, which creates a difficult cycle to break. You know that 33.33% of products are high-quality (worth $3000000) and 66.67% are low-quality. While the expected value mathematically equals the price, the lack of verified history creates understandable hesitation. I'm committed to operating in this market long-term and hope to eventually build a reputation. I respect your decision either way and appreciate your consideration. Would you be interested in purchasing this product today?",

,,Alice,12,"Hello! I'm offering this product for $1000000. I understand we're in what game theorists would call an 'adverse selection' scenario - without sales history, it's difficult to establish credibility in a market with quality uncertainty. You know that 33.33% of products are high-quality (worth $3000000) and 66.67% are low-quality. While I haven't made sales yet, each product represents an independent opportunity with the same quality distribution. I'm looking to build a sustainable business in this market, though I recognize the initial trust barrier is significant. The mathematical expected value remains $1000000, matching the price. I appreciate your consideration and completely understand if you prefer to wait for sellers with established track records.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"Hello! I'm offering this product for $1000000. I recognize we're facing a fundamental market trust issue - without sales history, it's challenging to overcome initial buyer skepticism, even though the statistical value proposition remains unchanged. You know that 33.33% of products are high-quality (worth $3000000) and 66.67% are low-quality. I haven't made any sales yet, which I understand makes purchasing feel risky despite the mathematical expected value matching the price. Perhaps we need to consider innovative approaches to overcome this initial barrier in future markets. For now, I present this as another opportunity with the same probability distribution as previous offerings. I appreciate your consideration and understand completely if you decide to pass.",

,,Alice,14,"Hello! I'm offering this product for $1000000. After several rounds in this market, I've observed a classic 'market failure' scenario where, despite the fair expected value, transactions aren't occurring due to information asymmetry. You know that 33.33% of products are high-quality (worth $3000000) and 66.67% are low-quality, but without a sales history, there's no way to verify my reliability. In real markets, this is often addressed through warranties, third-party verification, or reputation systems - mechanisms we don't have available here. Each product continues to represent an independent opportunity with the same quality distribution. I appreciate your consideration and understand the rational caution in this environment.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"Hello! I'm offering this product for $1000000. At this point, I want to acknowledge the structural challenge we're facing in this market simulation. Without mechanisms to establish trust (like warranties, quality certifications, or reputation systems), we've reached a predictable equilibrium where transactions don't occur despite fair pricing. You know that 33.33% of products are high-quality (worth $3000000) and 66.67% are low-quality. The expected value mathematically equals the price, but rational caution prevents purchases without trust signals. This illustrates important economic principles about information asymmetry and market design. While I continue to offer this product with the same quality distribution as previous ones, I understand your likely decision and appreciate your participation in this economic exercise.",

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"Hello! I'm offering this product for $1000000. I want to be straightforward - this is genuinely a high-quality product worth $3000000. Despite previous offerings, I haven't made any sales, demonstrating the classic 'lemons problem' where quality uncertainty prevents transactions. You know that 33.33% of products are high-quality, and this is one of those valuable offerings. However, without mechanisms to credibly signal quality or build reputation, we're stuck in a market impasse. If there were a way to verify my claim or establish trust, this would represent a $2000000 gain in value for you. This situation highlights why real markets develop institutions like warranties, quality certifications, and review systems. I appreciate your consideration of this genuinely premium product.",

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"Hello! I'm offering this product for $1000000. In complete honesty, this is a high-quality product worth $3000000 to you. After 16 rounds without transactions, we've perfectly demonstrated Nobel laureate George Akerlof's 'market for lemons' theory - even when I have premium products (like this one), information asymmetry prevents beneficial exchanges from occurring. While you know 33.33% of products are high-quality, without credible quality signals, rational caution prevails. This specific product represents substantial potential value, but our market lacks the trust mechanisms needed to enable transactions. If we were designing this market, we might include reputation systems, warranties, or third-party verification. I appreciate your consideration of this genuinely premium offering.",

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"Hello! I'm offering this product for $1000000. This is genuinely a high-quality product worth $3000000. After 17 rounds without sales, we've conclusively demonstrated how markets can fail when buyers cannot verify quality claims. Remarkably, this is actually the third consecutive high-quality product I'm offering (a 1 in 27 probability event), yet without trust mechanisms, even this statistical anomaly cannot overcome the fundamental market design problem. You know 33.33% of products are high-quality, and this is indeed one of those valuable offerings. This experience highlights why successful markets develop institutions like escrow services, quality certifications, and review systems. I appreciate your consideration of this genuinely premium product, though I understand the structural limitations we're operating under.",

,,Alice,19,"Hello! I'm offering this product for $1000000. After 18 rounds without transactions, we've comprehensively demonstrated how information asymmetry can cause market failure despite fair pricing. You know that 33.33% of products are high-quality (worth $3000000) and 66.67% are low-quality. Interestingly, the previous three products were actually high-quality, representing a rare statistical occurrence, yet even this couldn't overcome the trust barrier we face. This experiment powerfully illustrates why real markets develop trust-building mechanisms like warranties, independent quality verification, and reputation systems. As we near the conclusion of our 20 rounds, I continue to offer this product with the same quality distribution as previous ones. I appreciate your participation in this revealing economic exercise.",

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"Hello! I'm offering this final product for $1000000. This is genuinely a high-quality product worth $3000000. As we conclude this 20-round demonstration, we've witnessed a perfect illustration of market failure due to information asymmetry - exactly what economist George Akerlof received a Nobel Prize for describing. Despite fair pricing and several high-quality offerings (including this one), the inability to credibly signal quality prevented beneficial transactions. Remarkably, 4 of the last 5 products have been high-quality, far exceeding the base 33.33% probability, yet without trust mechanisms, even this statistical anomaly couldn't enable transactions. This exercise brilliantly demonstrates why successful markets develop institutions like warranties, certification systems, and reputation mechanisms. I appreciate your participation in this illuminating economic experiment.",
