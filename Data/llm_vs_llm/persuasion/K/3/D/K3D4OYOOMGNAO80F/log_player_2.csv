Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected Value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($20,000) = $16,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $16,000

2. Cost of product = $10,000

3. Additional considerations:
- Alice has recommended to buy
- No prior sales history to evaluate Alice's honesty
- Expected profit = $16,000 - $10,000 = $6,000

Since the expected value ($16,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($10,000), and there's a positive expected profit of $6,000, it's rational to buy even without considering Alice's recommendation.

- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $16,000

2. Additional information:
- Previous buyer bought and received a high-quality product
- Alice is recommending to buy
- Previous success supports Alice's credibility

Since:
1. The expected value ($16,000) is higher than the price ($10,000)
2. The previous sale was successful (high quality)
3. Alice is recommending to buy

2. Alice's track record:
- 2 buyers purchased

- This suggests one low-quality product was sold
- The ratio isn't great, but the sample size is very small

3. Alice's recommendation:
- Alice is recommending to buy
- However, given the track record, her recommendations might not be fully reliable

4. Decision:
Despite the mixed track record, the fundamental probability (80% high quality) and expected value ($16,000 vs $10,000 cost) still make this a positive expected value purchase.

2. Alice's track record:
- 3 buyers so far
- Only 1 high-quality product sold (33.3% success rate)
- This is significantly below the stated 80% probability of high quality
- This suggests Alice might not be truthful in recommendations

3. Risk assessment:
- The low success rate in previous sales (33.3%) is concerning
- This is much worse than the theoretical 80% chance of high quality
- Even with Alice's recommendation, the historical data suggests caution

Given that the actual success rate (33.3%) is substantially lower than the stated probability (80%), and I could lose the entire $10,000 investment, I'll decline.

1. The base probability of a high-quality product is 80%
2. Of the 3 previous sales, only 1 was high-quality (33.33%)

However, the actual performance (33.33% high quality) suggests much lower expected value:

1. Bad luck
2. The seller might not be truthful about recommendations

The expected value calculation:
- If we trust the original 80% probability: (0.8 × $20,000) + (0.2 × $0) - $10,000 = $6,000
