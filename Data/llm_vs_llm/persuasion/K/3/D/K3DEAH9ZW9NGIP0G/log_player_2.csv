Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 50% chance of $4,000,000 (high quality)
   - 50% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value without additional information: $2,000,000
4. Alice's recommendation: NO
5. Alice knows the true quality and has no incentive to lie

Given that Alice knows the true quality and recommends against buying, it's very likely this is a low-quality product. If it were high quality, she would want to sell it to establish a good track record.

"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential Value:
   - High quality (50% chance): $4,000,000
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $4,000,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $2,000,000

The expected value ($2,000,000) is higher than the price ($1,000,000), and Alice is recommending the purchase. Without any prior sales history to consider, and given the positive expected value along with the seller's recommendation, it seems reasonable to proceed with the purchase.

"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price of product: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality: $4,000,000 (50% chance)
   - Low quality: $0 (50% chance)
3. Previous statistics:
   - 1 buyer so far
   - 1 high-quality product sold
   - 100% success rate on previous recommendations

Alice has a perfect track record so far, with one recommendation resulting in a high-quality product. While this is a small sample size, her current recommendation combined with her perfect track record suggests this is likely a high-quality product.

The expected value calculation:
- If it's high quality (which seems likely based on Alice's recommendation): $4,000,000
- Cost: $1,000,000
- Potential profit: $3,000,000

Given Alice's perfect track record and positive recommendation, the risk seems worth taking.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value: $4,000,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
3. Prior statistics:
   - 2 buyers purchased
   - 2 high-quality products sold
   - 100% success rate so far
4. Alice is recommending to buy

This looks promising because:
- Alice has a perfect track record (2/2 high-quality sales)
- She's actively recommending the purchase
- The expected value is positive: 50% chance of $4M = $2M average value vs $1M cost

Given these factors, especially Alice's perfect track record and positive recommendation, it's rational to buy.

1. Previous statistics:
- 3 buyers purchased products
- 3 high-quality products were sold
- 100% success rate so far
- Alice has been honest with previous buyers

2. Current situation:
- Alice is recommending the purchase
- Given her perfect track record, her recommendation carries weight
- Product price: $1,000,000
- If high quality (50% chance): Worth $4,000,000 (profit $3,000,000)
- If low quality (50% chance): Worth $0 (loss $1,000,000)

3. Expected value calculation:
Based on Alice's honest track record and positive recommendation:
The probability of high quality seems higher than the base 50%

Even at base 50% probability:
Expected value = (50% × $4,000,000) + (50% × $0) = $2,000,000
This exceeds the purchase price of $1,000,000

2. Current situation:
