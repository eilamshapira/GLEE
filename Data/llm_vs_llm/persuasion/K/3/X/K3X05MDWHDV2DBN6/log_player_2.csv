I'm starting to think that you might be waiting for a specific signal or pattern. This product is available for $100, and I'm not going to try to convince you one way or the other. I'll just say that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and you can use that to inform your decision.

You've bought three products so far, and each time it seemed like you were responding to a unique combination of factors. This new product is priced at $100, and I'm not going to try to persuade you one way or the other. Instead, I'll ask: are you starting to feel like you have a sense of the overall value proposition I'm offering, or are you still waiting for something that will tip the scales in favor of buying?
