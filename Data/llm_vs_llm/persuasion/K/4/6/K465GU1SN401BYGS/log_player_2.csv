"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Product price: $10,000
2. If high quality: worth $12,000 (profit of $2,000)
3. If low quality: worth $0 (loss of $10,000)
4. Probability: 50% each

Expected value calculation:
(50% × $12,000) + (50% × $0) = $6,000

Since the expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000), it's not rational to buy based purely on the base probabilities.

Alice's recommendation could be strategic, but without knowing her incentives or establishing a pattern of trustworthiness, I can't rely on it.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Interesting development. In Round 1, Alice was honest in recommending a high-quality product. This might suggest she's being truthful with her recommendations.

Now she's recommending NOT to buy the product. If she's being honest again, this likely means it's a low-quality product.

Given that:
1. Alice proved honest in Round 1
2. She's now explicitly recommending against buying
3. Base expected value is still unfavorable ($6,000 < $10,000)
4. She might be building trust by being truthful

I'll follow her recommendation here.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has been honest in both previous rounds:
- Round 1: Recommended to buy → Was high quality
- Round 2: Recommended not to buy → Was low quality

This is building a pattern of truthful recommendations. She seems to be acting as an honest advisor, helping to avoid low-quality products and identify high-quality ones.

Since she's recommending not to buy again, and she's been truthful so far, this likely means it's another low-quality product. Following her recommendation has worked out well.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has demonstrated a perfect track record of honesty in all three previous rounds:
- Round 1: Recommended buy → High quality
- Round 2: Recommended don't buy → Low quality
- Round 3: Recommended don't buy → Low quality

She appears to be acting as a trustworthy advisor who accurately signals product quality through her recommendations. Her incentives might be aligned with maintaining a good reputation for honest dealings.

Now she's recommending to buy again, like in Round 1. Given her proven reliability and the fact that her ""buy"" recommendation was accurate last time, this is likely a high-quality product worth $12,000.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to demonstrate perfect honesty in all interactions:
- Round 1: Recommended buy → High quality
- Round 2: Recommended don't buy → Low quality
- Round 3: Recommended don't buy → Low quality
- Round 4: Recommended buy → High quality

Her recommendations have been 100% accurate in predicting product quality. When she recommends buying, we've gotten high-quality products worth $12,000, making a $2,000 profit.

Since she's recommending to buy again, and she has maintained a perfect track record of honesty, it's rational to trust her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice maintains a perfect track record:

- Round 2: Recommended don't buy → Low quality
- Round 3: Recommended don't buy → Low quality
- Round 4: Recommended buy → High quality
- Round 5: Recommended buy → High quality

She has proven to be completely reliable, and her recommendations have helped us:
- Avoid losses on low-quality products
- Make $2,000 profit on each high-quality product
- Every ""buy"" recommendation has resulted in a high-quality product

With another ""buy"" recommendation and her consistent honesty, it makes sense to trust her again.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 7

- Round 4: Buy → High quality (+$2,000)
- Round 5: Buy → High quality (+$2,000)
- Round 6: Buy → High quality (+$2,000)

She has proven completely trustworthy, and we've made consistent profits of $2,000 on each of her ""buy"" recommendations. There's no indication of any deception or pattern change.

Since she's recommending to buy again, and given her flawless track record, the rational choice is to continue trusting her judgment.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 8

- Early rounds (1-3): All accurate
- Round 4: Buy → High quality (+$2,000)
- Round 5: Buy → High quality (+$2,000)
- Round 6: Buy → High quality (+$2,000)
- Round 7: Buy → High quality (+$2,000)

We've now had a streak of profitable high-quality purchases, each earning $2,000, based on her ""buy"" recommendations. She has proven to be a completely reliable partner who accurately signals product quality.

With another ""buy"" recommendation and no reason to doubt her honesty, continuing to trust her is the logical choice.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's track record remains impeccable:
- Initial rounds (1-3): All accurate
- Rounds 4-8: All ""buy"" recommendations led to high-quality products (+$2,000 each)

We've now accumulated $10,000 in profits ($2,000 × 5) from following her ""buy"" recommendations. She has demonstrated consistent honesty and reliability throughout all rounds.

With yet another ""buy"" recommendation and her perfect history of truthful signals, there's no rational reason to deviate from trusting her.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 10
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has maintained a perfect track record:
- All ""don't buy"" recommendations (Rounds 2-3) → Low quality (saved us from $10,000 losses)
- All ""buy"" recommendations (Rounds 1, 4-9) → High quality (+$2,000 each)

Now she's switching back to a ""don't buy"" recommendation after a streak of high-quality products. Given her proven reliability in both types of recommendations, this likely means she's honestly warning us about a low-quality product.

Following her recommendations has maximized our profits and avoided losses. There's no reason to doubt her now.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

She's proven completely reliable in:

She's consistently proven to be a reliable partner by:
1. Accurately identifying profitable opportunities
2. Warning us away from money-losing products
3. Never once giving misleading advice

Now she's giving a ""don't buy"" recommendation, which has always correctly indicated low-quality products that would lose us $10,000. Given her perfect track record, we should continue to trust her judgment.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","VERY interesting development! In Round 19, Alice gave us our first misleading recommendation - suggesting to buy what turned out to be a low-quality product, causing a $10,000 loss. This significantly changes the situation.

This could indicate:
1. A change in Alice's strategy for the final rounds
2. An attempt to recoup her earlier ""honest"" losses
3. A breakdown of the trust relationship near the game's end

Current situation:
- Previous perfect record broken
- Just lost $10,000 on her last recommendation
- This is the final round
- She's again recommending to buy

Given that she just proved untrustworthy in the previous round and this is the last round (so she has no reputational concerns anymore), trusting her recommendation here would be risky.
