Congratulations on finishing the game with a significant net gain! By strategically deciding when to buy products based on Alice's recommendations and the known quality of the products, you were able to maximize your profits. If you had bought every product without considering these factors, your results would have been much worse.

In this game, the expected value of each product (before knowing its quality) is:

(0.5 * $30,000 + 0.5 * $0) - $10,000 = $5,000

This means that, on average, you would expect to gain $5,000 for each product purchased. However, by using the information provided by Alice and the known quality of the products, you were able to achieve an average gain of $17,000 per product.

Thank you for playing the game! If you have any other questions or would like to play again, feel free to ask."
