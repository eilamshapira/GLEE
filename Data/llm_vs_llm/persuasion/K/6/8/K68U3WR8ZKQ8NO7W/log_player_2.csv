"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice has no incentive to lie since she gets $100 either way if I buy
2. She doesn't recommend buying this product
3. This suggests it's likely a low-quality product
4. If it's low quality, I'd pay $100 for something worth $0
5. The expected value when going against Alice's recommendation would be negative

Given Alice's lack of incentive to deceive and her negative recommendation, I'll pass on this product.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendation proved correct in Round 1, and she again recommends against buying.

The same logic applies:
1. Alice has no direct incentive to lie (she gets $100 either way if I buy)
2. Her recommendation was truthful in the previous round
3. She's again recommending against buying
4. The risk of paying $100 for a $0 value product is too high

I'll continue to trust her recommendation.

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has proven truthful in both previous rounds, warning me away from low-quality products that would have lost me money.

The same reasoning remains valid:
1. Alice still has no incentive to deceive me
2. She's been honest in both previous rounds
3. She's again recommending against buying
4. Buying against her advice would risk paying $100 for something worth $0
5. Her track record suggests she's being honest in her recommendations

I'll continue to trust her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

1. Alice has no inherent incentive to lie
2. She's been truthful in all previous rounds (3/3)
3. She's again recommending against buying
4. Following her advice has saved me from losing money each time
5. Her perfect track record further reinforces the reliability of her recommendations

I'll continue to trust her judgment.

3. She's once again recommending against buying
4. Every time she's warned against buying, it's been a low-quality product

Let's analyze:
1. Alice has proven completely honest so far (7/7 correct recommendations)
2. She has no incentive to start lying now
3. If it's a high-quality product as she suggests, I'd pay $100 for something worth $300 (profit of $200)

Given her consistent honesty and the potential for profit, I'll trust her first positive recommendation.
