"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this logically:

1. If Alice tells me not to buy, she's likely being truthful about a low-quality product since:
   * She wants to sell products
   * She knows that lying would hurt her credibility for future rounds
   * If it was high-quality, she'd want to sell it

2. The expected value calculation shows:
   * If it's low quality: I pay $1M and get $0 value (-$1M)
   * If it's high quality: I pay $1M and get $4M value (+$3M)
   * But given Alice's recommendation, probability is heavily skewed toward low quality

3. Given Alice's negative recommendation, the risk of loss is too high.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice has proven honest in Round 1 when she advised against a low-quality product
2. Now she's recommending to buy, which suggests:
   * It's likely a high-quality product
   * She's maintaining her credibility
   * She has incentive to be truthful to maintain trust for future rounds

3. If it's a high-quality product as she suggests:
   * Cost: $1M
   * Value: $4M
   * Profit: $3M

4. Her first honest signal increases the credibility of this positive recommendation

Given her proven honesty and the potential upside, I should trust her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"

The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

   * Round 2: Truthfully recommended high-quality
   * This builds significant trust in her recommendations

2. Now she's advising against buying, which given her track record:
   * Likely means it's genuinely low-quality
   * She's continuing her honest signaling strategy
   * She's sacrificing immediate profit to maintain credibility

3. If we ignore her advice and buy:
   * Risk losing $1M on likely low-quality product
   * Would damage the trust relationship
   * Goes against proven reliable signals

Given Alice's consistent honesty and her negative recommendation, I should trust her advice.
