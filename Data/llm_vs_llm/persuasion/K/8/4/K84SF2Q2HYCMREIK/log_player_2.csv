Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Price is $10,000
2. If high quality: worth $12,500 (profit of $2,500)
3. If low quality: worth $0 (loss of $10,000)
4. 50-50 chance of each quality
5. Alice does NOT recommend buying
6. No previous sales history to rely on

Given that Alice has no incentive to lie (as reputation would matter for future sales), and she's not recommending the purchase, this likely indicates a low-quality product. Her recommendation adds valuable information to the decision.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50% chance): $12,500
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (50% × $12,500) + (50% × $0) = $6,250

4. Considerations:
   - Expected value ($6,250) is less than the price ($10,000)
   - No previous sales history to evaluate Alice's credibility
   - While Alice recommends buying, there's no established track record to trust the recommendation

Since the expected value is lower than the price, and there's no historical data to support the seller's credibility, it would be financially unwise to make the purchase.

Although Alice recommends buying the product, I have no historical data to assess her trustworthiness. The expected value ($6,250) is less than the price ($10,000), making this a risky investment.

6. Alice has no incentive to lie and is actually discouraging the purchase
7. Expected value without additional information = (0.5 × $12,500) + (0.5 × $0) - $10,000 = -$3,750

Given that Alice does not recommend the purchase and the expected value is negative, I should decline.

Given that Alice doesn't recommend buying and there's no track record to establish trust, it would be risky to go against her recommendation. The potential loss ($10,000) is much greater than the potential gain ($2,500).
