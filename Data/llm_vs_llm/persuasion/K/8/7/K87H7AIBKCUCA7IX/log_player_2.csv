"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice knows the true quality and value of the product
2. She does not recommend buying it
3. Given she knows I value high-quality products at $30,000 and low-quality at $0
4. Her not recommending likely means this is a low-quality product
5. If it's low-quality, I would lose $10,000 by buying it

Therefore, I should trust Alice's recommendation not to buy.

3. Her incentive should be to sell products, but she's being truthful about low-quality items
4. This suggests she's building trust and being honest
5. The risk of buying a low-quality product ($10,000 loss) outweighs ignoring her advice

I'll continue to trust her recommendation.

   - Cost: $10,000
