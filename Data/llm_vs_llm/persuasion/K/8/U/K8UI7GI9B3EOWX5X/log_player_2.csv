Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No prior information:** There is no information about the product's quality based on previous sales.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. While this recommendation doesn't guarantee quality, it's a signal that she believes it's worth considering.
* **Expected value:**  The expected value of buying is: 
    * (0.8 * $200) + (0.2 * $0) = $160
This is significantly higher than the price of $100.

Therefore, based on the available information and the expected value, it's rational to buy the product."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Signal:** Alice's recommendation to buy carries weight. Since she knows the true quality of the product, her recommendation is a strong signal that it is likely high-quality.
* **Past Data:** The fact that all 2 previous buyers purchased the products, and they were both high-quality, further reinforces the positive signal from Alice.
* **Expected Value:** Even with a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($200) outweighs the potential loss ($0). 

**Therefore, it's statistically advantageous to buy the product.**"
