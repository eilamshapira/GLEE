Alice's message: This product is priced at $100.  I understand you're aware there's a mix of high-quality and low-quality products.  While I can't reveal the quality of this specific item, I encourage you to consider the potential value and take a chance.  Every purchase helps me continue offering these products!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

- Each product costs $100
- High-quality products (worth $200 to me) have a 33.33% probability
- Low-quality products (worth $0 to me) have a 66.67% probability
- No products have been sold yet, so I have no sales history to inform me
- Alice's message doesn't provide any clear signal about this specific product's quality

The expected value calculation is:
(0.3333 × $200) + (0.6667 × $0) = $66.66

Since the expected value ($66.66) is less than the price ($100), making this purchase would not be rational from a pure expected value perspective.

Alice's message: This product is priced at $100.  There's a mix of high-quality and low-quality products available.

Alice's message: This product is available for $100. I understand the uncertainty around quality.
