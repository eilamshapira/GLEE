Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $1,000,000
2. Expected value calculation:
   * 50% chance of high quality ($3,000,000) = $1,500,000
   * 50% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
   * Total expected value = $1,500,000

3. Alice recommends buying the product, which could be a positive signal
4. There's no historical data to base additional judgment on

Since the expected value ($1,500,000) is higher than the price ($1,000,000), and we have a positive recommendation from Alice, it's rational to buy.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has made 1 previous sale, which was a high-quality product
2. Alice is not recommending this product to me
3. The price is $1,000,000
4. If high quality (50% chance), I gain $3,000,000 (net profit $2,000,000)
5. If low quality (50% chance), I gain $0 (net loss $1,000,000)

Given that Alice has been honest before (1/1 high-quality sales) and is now explicitly not recommending this product, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. Alice appears to be building a reputation for honesty.

Following her recommendation would help me avoid a likely loss.

1. Previous statistics:
- 1 buyer before me
- 1 purchase made
- 1 high-quality product sold
- This shows Alice has been honest so far

2. Current situation:
- Alice is NOT recommending the product
- Given her honest track record and that she's not recommending it, this strongly suggests the product is low quality
- If it's low quality, it's worth $0 to me
- The price is $1,000,000

3. Decision logic:
- Alice's negative recommendation combined with her honest history suggests this is likely a low-quality product
- Buying would likely result in a $1,000,000 loss
- The risk is too high given the strong negative signal

- If low quality: gain $0 (loss $1,000,000)
- 50-50 base probability

Given that Alice has been honest so far (1/1 high-quality sales) and she's now recommending against buying, it's likely that she has seen this is a low-quality product. Her negative recommendation combined with her previous accurate track record suggests this is probably not a good purchase.

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:

   - Low quality: $0 (50% chance)
3. Previous statistics:
   - 1 buyer so far
   - 1 high-quality product sold
   - Alice recommended buying and is recommending now

The fact that the previous sale was a high-quality product and Alice is recommending this one is promising. Alice seems to be honest with her recommendations so far. 

Expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of $3,000,000 = $1,500,000
- 50% chance of $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $1,500,000

2. Current situation:
