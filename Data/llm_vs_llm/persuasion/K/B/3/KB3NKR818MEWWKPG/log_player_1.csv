I think we need to change our strategy. The buyers are not buying the product because they know the probability of getting a high-quality product is only 33.33%. They are not willing to take the risk of spending $10,000 for a product that has a high chance of being worth $0 to them.

To build trust, I recommend the following strategy:

1. **Honesty**: Inform the buyers about the quality of the product.
2. **Transparency**: Share the statistics about the products sold so far and their quality.
3. **Build Reputation**: Since the buyers know the general probability of getting a high-quality product is 33.33%, we need to build a reputation by selling high-quality products whenever they are available.

Let's try this approach for the next rounds."
