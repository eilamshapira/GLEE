This game seems to be a great example of a decision-making process under uncertainty. To maximize the expected value, I should always follow Alice's recommendations. Based on the given probabilities and payoffs, let's calculate the expected value of following Alice's recommendations:

- When Alice recommends buying the product, there's an 80% chance it's high-quality and a 20% chance it's low-quality. The expected value of buying in this case is:
  (0.8 * $125) + (0.2 * $0) - $100 = $20.

- When Alice does not recommend buying the product, there's a 66.67% chance it's low-quality. The expected value of not buying in this case is:
  (0.6667 * $0) + (0.3333 * $125) = $41.67 (approximately). Since I won't spend $100, this strategy yields no profit or loss.

This shows that following Alice's recommendations is a dominant strategy, maximizing the expected value."
