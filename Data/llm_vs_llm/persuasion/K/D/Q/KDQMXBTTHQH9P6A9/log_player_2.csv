"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Value if high quality (80% chance): $1,250,000
3. Value if low quality (20% chance): $0
4. Expected value: (0.8 × $1,250,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $1,000,000

The expected value equals the price, so in a purely mathematical sense, this is a fair deal. However, since Alice knows the true quality and is recommending to buy, this suggests the product is more likely to be high quality.

Therefore, I should accept the recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice was honest in Round 1, recommending a high-quality product. This builds some trust in her recommendations.

The fundamentals remain the same:
1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Value if high quality (80% chance): $1,250,000
3. Value if low quality (20% chance): $0
4. Base expected value: $1,000,000

Given that:
- Alice has shown honesty in her first recommendation
- She's explicitly recommending to buy again
- She knows the true quality and the product's value to me
- She seems to be establishing a pattern of honest recommendations

I should accept her recommendation again.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has now given two honest recommendations in a row, both for high-quality products. This further strengthens the trust in her recommendations.

The economics remain unchanged:
1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Value if high quality (80% chance): $1,250,000
3. Value if low quality (20% chance): $0
4. Base expected value: $1,000,000

Given that:
- Alice has established a pattern of honest recommendations
- She's continuing to recommend buying
- She has perfect information about the product quality
- She could be building a reputation for trustworthy advice
- Her interests seem aligned with providing good recommendations

The rational choice is to continue trusting her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is an interesting change. For the first time, Alice is recommending NOT to buy the product. Let's analyze:

1. Alice has been honest for three straight rounds, building credibility
2. She knows the true quality and my valuation
3. She's now explicitly recommending against buying
4. Given her track record of honesty, this likely means the product is low quality
5. If it's low quality, my value would be $0, resulting in a $1,000,000 loss

Alice has demonstrated trustworthy behavior so far, and she has no obvious incentive to suddenly lie in the opposite direction (telling me not to buy a good product). If she's being consistent with her previous honest behavior, this negative recommendation likely means the product is low quality.

The safest decision is to trust her negative recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has now proven to be completely honest in all four previous rounds:

This pattern strongly suggests that:
1. Alice is providing honest recommendations
2. She's acting as a reliable quality signal
3. Her interests seem aligned with maintaining trust
4. When she recommends buying, it has consistently been for high-quality products

Given her perfect track record and return to a positive recommendation, this product is very likely to be high-quality. The expected value when following her recommendations has been consistently positive.

The rational choice is to continue trusting her demonstrated pattern of honest recommendations.

1. Her recommendations perfectly correlate with product quality
