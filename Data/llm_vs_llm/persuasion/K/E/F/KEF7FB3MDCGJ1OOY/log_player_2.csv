Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Product price: $10,000
2. Expected value calculation:
   * 80% chance of high quality ($40,000) = $32,000
   * 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
   * Total expected value = $32,000

3. Alice recommends buying the product
4. No previous sales history to verify Alice's trustworthiness

Even without historical data, the expected value ($32,000) is significantly higher than the price ($10,000). With an 80% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $40,000, this is a positive expected value proposition.
