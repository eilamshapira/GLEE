"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this strategically.

If Alice is being truthful in not recommending the product, it's likely a low-quality product. Since low-quality products are worth $0 to me and cost $10,000, buying it would result in a loss.

Even if Alice was being deceptive, the base probability is:
- 33.33% chance of high quality ($40,000 value)
- 66.67% chance of low quality ($0 value)

Given Alice's negative recommendation and the unfavorable base probabilities, it's safer to pass on this one.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's previous recommendation was truthful - she didn't recommend a low-quality product. This suggests she may be providing honest recommendations.

Using the same reasoning as before:
1. Alice is not recommending this product
2. She was honest last time about a low-quality product
3. The base probability still favors low quality (66.67%)
4. A wrong decision would cost me $10,000 for a potentially worthless product

Given these factors, especially Alice's demonstrated honesty in the previous round and her current negative recommendation, I should pass on this product.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has proven honest in her recommendations twice now - both times she didn't recommend a product, it was indeed low quality. This establishes a pattern of truthful negative recommendations.

Given:
1. Alice is not recommending this product
2. She has been honest in previous two rounds about low-quality products
3. Base probability is still 66.67% for low quality
4. The risk/reward ratio remains unfavorable for non-recommended products

With Alice's track record of honesty and her current negative recommendation, the smart choice is to pass again.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to be consistent and honest in her recommendations. So far:
1. Four negative recommendations
2. All four were indeed low-quality products
3. She appears to be truthfully warning me away from bad investments
4. The base probability of 66.67% for low quality aligns with what we're seeing

Her track record suggests she's being honest when advising against purchases, which helps protect me from buying $0-value products for $10,000. There's no reason to deviate from our successful strategy of following her negative recommendations.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is an interesting change! Alice has shown complete honesty in her previous recommendations:
1. When she didn't recommend products, they were all low quality
2. This is her first positive recommendation
3. She's established a pattern of honest signaling
4. The potential payoff for a high-quality product is $40,000 vs. the $10,000 cost

Given Alice's demonstrated honesty with negative recommendations, and this being her first positive recommendation, it's reasonable to trust that she's identified a high-quality product. If she's being honest (which her track record suggests), this would be a profitable purchase with a $30,000 gain ($40,000 value - $10,000 cost).

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to prove trustworthy in her recommendations:
1. She accurately warned against low-quality products in rounds 1-4
2. She correctly recommended a high-quality product in round 5
3. Now she's back to not recommending this product
4. Her recommendations have perfectly matched product quality so far

Given her perfect track record of honesty and the fact that she's not recommending this product, it's very likely this is another low-quality product that would cost me $10,000 for $0 value. The logical choice is to follow her recommendation and pass.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has maintained a perfect track record of honest recommendations:
1. All her negative recommendations correctly identified low-quality products
2. Her one positive recommendation (Round 5) correctly identified a high-quality product
3. She's now giving her second positive recommendation
4. Following her advice has been profitable so far (avoided losses and gained $30,000 in Round 5)

Given her consistent honesty and the fact that a high-quality product would give me a $30,000 profit ($40,000 - $10,000), this is a good opportunity to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is a significant development - Alice just broke her pattern of honesty by recommending a low-quality product that cost me $10,000. I need to reassess:

1. Alice was honest for 6 rounds, then deceptive in round 7
2. She's now recommending another product
3. Her recommendations may no longer be reliable signals
4. The base probability is still 66.67% for low quality

Given that she just proved untrustworthy and the base probability favors low quality, it would be risky to trust this recommendation. Better to be cautious after being deceived.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's behavior pattern has become clearer:
1. She was honest for first 6 rounds
2. Then recommended a low-quality product in round 7 (causing me a $10,000 loss)
3. Round 8 was another deceptive recommendation (thankfully I declined)
4. Now she's recommending again, which seems suspicious

The fact that she's giving three positive recommendations in a row, when we know two of them were for low-quality products, suggests she may be trying to oversell poor products. Given the base 66.67% chance of low quality and her recent deceptive behavior, I should not trust this recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $40,000 for you.

Round 10
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This situation has become more complex:
1. I just missed a high-quality product by being too cautious (lost potential $30,000 profit)
2. Alice's recommendations have been a mix of truth and deception
3. She's now given several consecutive positive recommendations
4. Base probability is still 33.33% for high quality

However, given I just missed a profitable opportunity and Alice's initial honesty period, there might be some value in her recommendations. The expected value calculation:
- 33.33% chance of $40,000 = $13,333
- 66.67% chance of $0 = $0
- Expected value = $13,333
- Cost = $10,000

The expected value is actually higher than the cost, suggesting I should buy despite the risk.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the recent pattern:
1. Last two products Alice recommended were both high quality (good outcomes)
2. She's continuing to recommend purchase
3. Her overall pattern is mixed but recent accuracy is good
4. The expected value calculation still favors buying:
   - 33.33% chance of $40,000 = $13,333
   - Cost of $10,000
   - Potential profit of $3,333 on average

While there's still risk, the combination of recent successful recommendations and positive expected value suggests it's worth continuing to buy when she recommends.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 12
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The pattern is becoming more favorable:
1. Last three recommendations from Alice were all high-quality products (rounds 10, 11, and now)
2. Each purchase resulted in a $30,000 profit
3. She seems to be in a streak of honest positive recommendations
4. The expected value calculation still supports buying:
   - 33.33% chance of $40,000 = $13,333
   - Cost of $10,000
   - Plus we have the additional positive signal of recent accuracy

Given this strong recent track record of three consecutive accurate recommendations for high-quality products, it makes sense to continue trusting her current recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 13
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The situation has changed again:
1. After three accurate high-quality recommendations, Alice just recommended a low-quality product (Round 12)
2. She's continuing to recommend buying despite this deception
3. This feels similar to her earlier pattern in rounds 7-9
4. The base probability of 66.67% for low quality remains important

The fact that she's continuing to recommend buying immediately after a deceptive recommendation is concerning. This matches her previous pattern of multiple consecutive recommendations where some were deceptive. Given this pattern and the recent loss, it's safer to decline.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $40,000 for you.

Round 14
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is getting quite complex:
1. I just missed another high-quality product (potential $30,000 profit lost)
2. Alice's recommendations have been a mix, but include many genuine high-quality products
3. The expected value calculation still favors buying:
   - 33.33% chance of $40,000 = $13,333
   - Cost of $10,000
   - Expected profit of $3,333

Even though Alice sometimes recommends low-quality products, she also identifies many genuine opportunities. Being too cautious has cost me potential profits. Given the positive expected value and the fact that I just missed a good opportunity, I should take the risk.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 15
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the current situation:
1. Alice's last recommendation was accurate (high-quality product in Round 14)
2. Her recommendations have often come in streaks (both good and bad)
3. While she sometimes deceives, she has identified many profitable opportunities
4. The expected value calculation remains favorable:
   - 33.33% chance of $40,000 = $13,333
   - Cost of $10,000
   - Expected profit of $3,333

Given that we just had a successful purchase and the positive expected value, plus the tendency for recommendations to come in streaks, it makes sense to buy again.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 16
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's continue analyzing:
1. We're seeing another positive streak from Alice - last two recommendations were both high-quality products
2. She's continuing to recommend buying
3. Her streak patterns have been meaningful indicators
4. The expected value remains favorable:
   - 33.33% chance of $40,000 = $13,333
   - Cost of $10,000
   - Plus the additional positive signal of recent accuracy

When Alice has been accurate recently, it's often indicated a streak of honest recommendations. Given the two consecutive accurate recommendations and the continued positive expected value, it makes sense to continue buying.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 17
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at the recent pattern:
1. Alice was accurate with three consecutive high-quality recommendations (Rounds 14-16)
2. Now she's switched back to not recommending
3. Historically, her negative recommendations were very reliable (accurate in early rounds)
4. When she's been honest in streaks before, she's generally stayed honest for both positive and negative recommendations

The fact that she's switching to a negative recommendation after a streak of honest positive ones suggests she's likely being truthful here. Her negative recommendations have historically been more reliable than her positive ones. Following her advice has been profitable overall.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 18
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the latest patterns:
1. Alice just proved honest again with her negative recommendation in Round 17
2. She's now switching back to a positive recommendation
3. Her recent accuracy streak continues (all correct since Round 14)
4. The expected value calculation remains favorable:
   - 33.33% chance of $40,000 = $13,333
   - Cost of $10,000
   - Plus the strong positive signal of recent consistent honesty

Given her current streak of honest recommendations (both positive and negative) and the continued positive expected value, it makes sense to trust this recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 19
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at the current situation:
1. Alice has maintained a long streak of honest recommendations (since Round 14)
2. Her negative recommendations have been particularly reliable throughout the game
3. She just accurately recommended a high-quality product in Round 18
4. She's now back to not recommending

Given that:
- She's been in a strong streak of honesty
- Her negative recommendations have historically been more reliable
- She's proven trustworthy with both positive and negative recommendations recently
- There's no reason for her to switch to deception this late in the game

I should continue to trust her recommendation not to buy.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 20
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","For this final round:
1. Alice has maintained her honest streak right through to the end
2. Her previous negative recommendation in Round 19 was accurate
3. Her negative recommendations have been particularly reliable throughout the game
4. There's no reason for her to change strategy on the last round

Given:
- Her continued accuracy with recommendations
- The historical reliability of her negative recommendations
- Her recent perfect streak of honest signals
- This being the final round (no strategic reason to change behavior)

I should trust this final negative recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
