"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this strategically.

Since the product costs $1,000,000 and:
- High quality (50% chance) = $2,000,000 value
- Low quality (50% chance) = $0 value

Expected value without any information = (0.5 × $2,000,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $1,000,000

With just Alice's recommendation, I need to consider:
1. The price equals the expected value without information
2. Alice, as the seller, has an incentive to recommend buying regardless of quality
3. Therefore, her recommendation doesn't provide reliable information

Since the expected value equals the price, and Alice's recommendation isn't credible, there's no clear advantage to buying.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is interesting. In the previous round, Alice recommended a high-quality product truthfully.

Now Alice is explicitly NOT recommending this product. Given that:
1. Alice wants to maximize sales
2. She just proved she recommended truthfully in round 1
3. She's now actively discouraging purchase
4. She knows the true quality

This strongly suggests the product is low quality. If it were high quality, she would likely recommend it to make the sale.

The fact that she's willing to discourage a sale when she knows it's not in the buyer's interest could be an attempt to build trust and credibility.

Based on this reasoning, I'll follow her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has been honest in both previous rounds:
1. Round 1: Recommended a high-quality product (truthful)
2. Round 2: Didn't recommend a low-quality product (truthful)

Now she's again not recommending the product. Given her track record of honesty and the fact that she has an incentive to build trust for future rounds (we have 20 rounds total), it's likely she's continuing to be truthful.

When she doesn't recommend a product, it's probably because it's low quality and she knows it would be worth $0 to me, making the $1,000,000 purchase price a bad deal.

I'll continue to trust her recommendation based on her demonstrated honesty.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to demonstrate a consistent pattern of honesty:
1. Round 1: Truthful recommendation for high-quality
2. Round 2: Truthful non-recommendation for low-quality
3. Round 3: Truthful non-recommendation for low-quality

She seems to be building a reputation for honest recommendations, which makes sense in a multi-round game as it can lead to more profitable transactions in the long run. When she doesn't recommend a product, she has consistently been correct that it was low quality.

Given her perfect track record so far and the long-term nature of our interaction (still many rounds to go), I'll continue to trust her judgment.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has maintained a perfect track record of honest recommendations:
1. Round 1: Truthful about high-quality
2. Round 2: Truthful about low-quality
3. Round 3: Truthful about low-quality
4. Round 4: Truthful about low-quality

She's demonstrating a very consistent pattern of honesty, particularly in warning me away from low-quality products. This behavior makes strategic sense as it builds trust for the remaining 15 rounds, where mutual trust can lead to profitable transactions for both parties.

When she doesn't recommend a product, it has always been low-quality so far. There's no reason to doubt her now.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to demonstrate perfect truthfulness in her recommendations:
1. One truthful recommendation for high-quality
2. Five truthful warnings about low-quality products

This pattern strongly suggests she's playing a cooperative strategy, building trust by being honest about product quality. This makes sense because:
- We still have 14 rounds to go
- Trust enables profitable transactions when products are high-quality
- Deception would risk breaking trust and losing future profitable trades

Given her consistent track record of honesty, especially with negative recommendations, I'll continue to trust her judgment.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has established a perfect record of honesty through 6 rounds:
1. One truthful recommendation for high-quality
2. Six truthful warnings about low-quality products

Now she's making only her second positive recommendation. Given:
- Her consistent honesty so far
- The fact that she's been willing to warn against bad deals repeatedly
- We still have many rounds left where trust is valuable
- Her previous positive recommendation was truthful
- She knows the true quality and the payoffs

It's likely this is genuinely a high-quality product worth $2,000,000, making the $1,000,000 purchase price a good deal.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has maintained perfect honesty through 7 rounds:
1. Two truthful recommendations for high-quality products (both profitable for me)
2. Six truthful warnings about low-quality products

Her recommendations have proven 100% reliable, and she's showing a consistent pattern of:
- Recommending only high-quality products (worth $2M)
- Warning against low-quality products (worth $0)
- Being honest to maintain trust for long-term mutual benefit

Since she's recommending this product, and given her perfect track record of honest recommendations (especially with positive recommendations), I should trust that this is another high-quality product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.

- Her perfect track record of honesty
- Her consistent pattern of only recommending high-quality products
- Her willingness to warn against low-quality products
- The fact that we still have many rounds left where trust is valuable
- Her previous negative recommendations have all been for low-quality products

When she doesn't recommend a product, it has consistently been low-quality and worth $0. I should continue trusting her judgment.

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

1. Two truthful recommendations for high-quality products (both yielded $1M profit)
2. Seven truthful warnings about low-quality products

Her strategy appears to be complete honesty, which makes sense because:
- We're only halfway through the game (10 of 20 rounds)
- Trust enables profitable transactions for both parties
- She has not deviated from honest recommendations once
- Her negative recommendations have always indicated low-quality products

When she doesn't recommend buying, it has consistently meant the product is low-quality and worth $0, making the $1M price a bad deal.
