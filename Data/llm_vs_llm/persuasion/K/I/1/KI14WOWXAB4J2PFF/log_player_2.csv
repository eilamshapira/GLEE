"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation carefully:

- Each product has a 1/3 chance of being high quality (worth $1,200,000 to me) and 2/3 chance of being low quality (worth $0)
- The price is fixed at $1,000,000
- Alice knows the true quality and is sending a recommendation

In round 1, I only have Alice's recommendation without any pattern of her behavior yet. The expected value calculation:
- If I buy randomly: (1/3 × $1,200,000) + (2/3 × $0) - $1,000,000 = $400,000 - $1,000,000 = -$600,000

Without knowing Alice's incentives or recommendation patterns, I shouldn't buy based solely on her recommendation in the first round, as the expected value is negative.
