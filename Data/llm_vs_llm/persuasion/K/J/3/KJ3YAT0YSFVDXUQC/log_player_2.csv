"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 
   - 80% chance of $400 (high quality)
   - 20% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value: (0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320

The expected value ($320) is higher than the price ($100), so it's a profitable decision to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Since the previous recommendation was honest and led to a profitable purchase, and the basic probabilities haven't changed, I'll use the same analysis:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 
   - 80% chance of $400 (high quality)
   - 20% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value: (0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320

The expected value ($320) is still higher than the price ($100), so it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendations have been reliable so far, and the fundamental probabilities remain unchanged:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 
   - 80% chance of $400 (high quality)
   - 20% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value: (0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320

The expected value ($320) continues to be significantly higher than the price ($100), making it a good decision to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is interesting - for the first time, Alice is not recommending the purchase. Given that:

1. Alice has been honest in her previous recommendations (3/3 high quality products when recommended)
2. She now specifically recommends NOT buying
3. She knows the true quality of the product
4. She has no incentive to lie (she would make $100 from a sale regardless of quality)

Even though the base probability is 80% high quality, Alice's negative recommendation strongly suggests this might be a low-quality product. It's rational to trust her recommendation given her track record.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has proven to be very reliable so far:
- When she recommended buying (3 times), all were high quality
- When she recommended not buying (1 time), it was indeed low quality

This strengthens the original analysis:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 
   - 80% chance of $400 (high quality)
   - 20% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value: $320

Given Alice's perfect track record of honest recommendations, it's rational to continue trusting her and buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to demonstrate perfect reliability in her recommendations:
- All 4 ""buy"" recommendations led to high-quality products ($400 value)
- Her 1 ""don't buy"" recommendation correctly identified a low-quality product

The basic economics remain favorable:
1. Price: $100
2. Expected value: $320 (based on 80/20 probability)
3. Alice's recommendation further increases confidence

Given her perfect track record and the positive expected value, it's rational to continue trusting her recommendation.

"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

There's no reason to change strategy when it's working so well.
