Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

- The product costs $10,000
- A high-quality product is worth $12,500 to me (profit of $2,500)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality
- Alice knows the product quality
- Alice does not recommend buying this product

Since Alice knows the product quality and is not recommending the purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If I were to ignore Alice's recommendation and buy randomly, my expected value would be: 
0.5 × $12,500 + 0.5 × $0 - $10,000 = -$3,750

However, with Alice explicitly not recommending the purchase, the probability of it being low quality is likely much higher than 50%, making the expected value even worse.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information provided, I need to decide whether to buy the product for $10,000.

Key considerations:
- The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $12,500) and 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0)
- Expected value of a random product = 0.5 × $12,500 + 0.5 × $0 = $6,250
- Alice knows the true quality and is recommending I buy
- There is no sales history to evaluate Alice's trustworthiness

Since Alice knows the product quality and is recommending purchase, this suggests the product may be high quality. However, Alice also has an incentive to sell regardless of quality.

Without past sales data to assess Alice's honesty, and with the expected value ($6,250) being less than the asking price ($10,000), I should decline.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to carefully analyze this situation:

- Price of the product: $10,000
- Value if high quality: $12,500 (profit of $2,500)
- Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $10,000)
- Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality

The seller knows the quality and is not recommending the purchase. Since Alice knows the true quality and values, this is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. If it were high quality, Alice would probably recommend it since it would lead to a sale.

Given this negative recommendation, the expected value of purchasing is significantly lower than the $10,000 price.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether to buy the product based on the given information.

Alice doesn't recommend buying the product. Since she knows the true quality and the product is worth either $12,500 (high quality) or $0 (low quality) to me, her recommendation is likely based on the actual quality.

While there's no previous sales record to assess Alice's honesty, her recommendation provides valuable information. Since she's advising against purchase, and she knows the true quality, this suggests the product is likely low quality.

If the product is low quality, it's worth $0 to me but costs $10,000, resulting in a significant loss.

1. A high-quality product is worth $12,500 to me (profit of $2,500)
2. A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
3. The prior probability is 50% for high quality and 50% for low quality
4. Alice knows the true quality of the product
5. Alice does NOT recommend buying the product

Alice has information about the product quality and does not recommend purchasing it. Since she knows the quality and has no incentive to recommend against a high-quality product, her recommendation suggests the product is likely low quality.

Taking all this information into account, I should follow Alice's recommendation.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully. 

Alice recommends buying the product, but I need to consider the expected value:
- High-quality product (50% chance): Worth $12,500 to me
- Low-quality product (50% chance): Worth $0 to me
- Expected value: 0.5 × $12,500 + 0.5 × $0 = $6,250

Since the price is $10,000 and the expected value is only $6,250, buying the product would result in an expected loss of $3,750.

Even though Alice recommends buying, there's no sales history to establish her credibility, and she knows which products are high/low quality. Her incentive is to sell regardless of quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Alice does not recommend that I buy the product, which suggests it might be low quality. Since Alice knows the true value of each product and has incentives to sell, her recommendation not to buy is significant.

Given that:
- I'd pay $10,000 for the product
- A high-quality product is worth $12,500 to me (profit of $2,500)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- Alice specifically recommends against buying
- There's no prior sales history to establish a pattern of trustworthiness

Alice's recommendation against buying likely indicates this is a low-quality product. While the prior probability was 50/50, her recommendation updates my belief toward this being a low-quality product.

- Product price: $10,000
- High-quality product value: $12,500 (50% chance)

- Alice does not recommend buying the product

The expected value of a random product is: 0.5 × $12,500 + 0.5 × $0 = $6,250, which is less than the $10,000 price.

However, Alice knows the product quality and has chosen not to recommend it. This suggests that the product is likely low quality. Since Alice has perfect information about the product quality, and she's not recommending it, I should trust this signal.

Based on Alice's negative recommendation, I will not buy the product.

- Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality

- Fixed price is $10,000
- Alice knows the quality and is recommending I buy
- 1 previous buyer purchased based on Alice's recommendation, and that product was high-quality

Given Alice's recommendation and her perfect track record so far (1/1 high-quality recommendations), it's reasonable to trust her recommendation. If the product is high-quality as she suggests, my expected value is $12,500 - $10,000 = $2,500 profit.

Alice's recommendation record:
- 2 buyers purchased based on Alice's recommendations
- 2 high-quality products were sold
- I would be the 3rd buyer

Alice is recommending I buy the current product.

Given the 100% track record of high-quality products sold so far (2 out of 2) and Alice's positive recommendation, it appears Alice is making honest recommendations. Since a high-quality product is worth $12,500 to me and costs $10,000, buying would yield an expected profit if Alice is truthful.

4) Alice has sold 3 products so far, and all were high quality
5) Alice is recommending that I buy this product

The fact that Alice has only sold high-quality products so far is a positive sign. Since Alice knows the true quality and has recommended purchase, and her track record shows she has been honest with previous buyers, there's a good reason to trust her recommendation.

Expected value calculation:
- If high quality (which seems likely): $12,500 - $10,000 = $2,500 profit
- If low quality: $0 - $10,000 = -$10,000 loss

Based on Alice's perfect track record and direct recommendation, I believe this product is likely high quality.

Alice is recommending against buying this product, and given her perfect track record so far (5/5 high-quality products sold), her recommendation is likely reliable. Since she's advising against purchase, the product is very likely low quality, which would result in a $10,000 loss for me.
