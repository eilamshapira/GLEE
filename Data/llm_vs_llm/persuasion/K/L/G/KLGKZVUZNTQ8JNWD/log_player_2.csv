Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I have another product available for $10000. It's a good opportunity, but I must inform you that the previous buyer who didn't buy in the last round also made a good decision for their needs.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I have a new product available for $10000. I want to assure you that this one is of particular interest, and I think you'll find it's worth considering. It stands out from the previous two offerings.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I have another product available for $10000. I want to be transparent with you - I think the previous round's product was a rare find, and this one doesn't quite live up to that standard.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: I have a new product available for $10000. Honestly, it's quite similar to the ones from Rounds 1, 2, and 4. If you weren't interested in those, this one might not be for you either.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: I have another product available for $10000. I think it's fair to say that this one is more of the same as the majority of the previous products. If you're waiting for something exceptional, this might not be it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: I have a new product available for $10000. To be frank, it's another one that doesn't particularly stand out. If you're looking for something special, you might want to wait for a future round.

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice's message: I have another product available for $10000. I want to reiterate that the majority of products I've offered so far have been, shall we say, unremarkable. This one falls into that category as well.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice's message: I have a new product available for $10000. I want to highlight that this one is genuinely exceptional, a true standout from the rest. If you've been waiting for something special, this could be the one.

"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 10
Alice's message: I have another product available for $10000. I want to temper your expectations after the previous round's success - this one doesn't quite meet the same standards. It's more in line with the majority of the products I've offered so far.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 11
Alice's message: I have a new product available for $10000. To be blunt, it's another unremarkable one. I think you made the right call in Round 10, and this one probably won't change your mind.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 12
Alice's message: I have another product available for $10000. I'm starting to sound like a broken record, but this one is also fairly ordinary. If you're holding out for something like Round 9's product, this isn't it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 13
Alice's message: I have a new product available for $10000. Honestly, it's more of the same. I think you've gotten a good sense of the baseline quality by now, and this one doesn't deviate from that.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 14
Alice's message: I have another product available for $10000. I want to signal to you that this one is a significant departure from the recent string of unremarkable products. It's genuinely top-notch, and I think you'll find it's worth considering, much like the one from Round 9.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 15
Alice's message: I have a new product available for $10000. I'm pleased to say that this one continues the streak of exceptional quality, on par with Rounds 9 and 14. If you're looking to capitalize on another outstanding opportunity, this might be the one.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 16
Alice's message: I have another product available for $10000. I want to caution you that this one doesn't quite live up to the standards set by the previous two rounds. It's more in line with the majority of the products I've offered, and I think you might want to exercise some caution here.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 17
Alice's message: I have a new product available for $10000. To be frank, it's another return to the baseline quality. I think you made the right call in Round 16, and this one probably won't change your mind. The exceptional products from Rounds 9, 14, and 15 are the outliers, not the norm.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 18
Alice's message: I have another product available for $10000. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this one is also unremarkable. If you're waiting for another standout product like the ones from Rounds 9, 14, and 15, this isn't it. I'll keep offering products, and maybe the next one will be the one you're looking for.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 19
Alice's message: I have a new product available for $10000. At this point, I think it's clear that the majority of products I offer are going to be fairly ordinary. This one is no exception. If you're holding out for something exceptional, you might want to wait for the final round to see if I can end on a high note.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 20
Alice's message: I have one final product available for $10000. Unfortunately, it's not the high note I was hoping to end on. This one is more of the same, and I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for something special. I appreciate the business we've done, and I'm glad I could provide you with some exceptional products in Rounds 9, 14, and 15.
