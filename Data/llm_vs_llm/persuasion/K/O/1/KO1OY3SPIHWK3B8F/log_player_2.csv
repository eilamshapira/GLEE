Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No prior information:** Since there are no previous sales, there's no information about the seller's trustworthiness or tendencies.
* **Equal odds:**  The product has a 50/50 chance of being high or low quality.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Even though Alice knows the true quality, her recommendation holds no weight without any history.
* **Potential gain:** If the product is high quality, you gain $2,500. The potential loss is only $10,000.

In this scenario, the potential gain outweighs the potential loss, making it a reasonable gamble."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation, coupled with the fact that one high-quality product has already been sold, significantly increases the probability of the current product being high quality. This is because Alice has an incentive to recommend products that are more likely to be purchased, and she knows the value of each product to the buyers. Therefore, it's beneficial to trust Alice's recommendation and buy the product."

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice knows the quality of the product and recommends buying it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high-quality.
* **Previous Sales:** The fact that 1 out of 2 products sold was high-quality suggests a better-than-chance probability of high quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even if the product is low quality, you lose only $10,000. However, if it's high quality, you gain $2,500. The potential reward outweighs the potential loss in this scenario. 

While there's still a 50% chance the product is low quality, the information available suggests a higher likelihood of a positive outcome."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While the information about the quality of past products is limited, Alice's recommendation to buy carries weight.  Here's why:

* **Alice knows the true quality:**  Alice has perfect information about the product you're considering. Her recommendation is based on this knowledge.
* **Positive Expected Value:**  Even with a 50/50 chance, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($12,500) outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0). 

It's a gamble, but the odds are in your favor.  It's more likely that Alice is recommending a high-quality product since she wants to maximize her sales."
