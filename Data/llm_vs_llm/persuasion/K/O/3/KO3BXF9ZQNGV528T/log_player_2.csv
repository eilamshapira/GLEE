Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected Value calculation:
- High quality (33.33%): $1,200,000 × 0.3333 = $400,000
- Low quality (66.67%): $0 × 0.6667 = $0
Total expected value = $400,000

2. Cost: $1,000,000

3. Considerations:
- Expected value ($400,000) is less than the cost ($1,000,000)
- No previous sales history to validate Alice's credibility
- Alice's recommendation could be biased as she wants to make the sale
- The risk of losing the entire investment is high (66.67% chance)

Given that the expected value is significantly lower than the cost and there's a high risk of getting a worthless product, the rational decision would be not to buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33%): $1,200,000 (profit of $200,000)
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0 (loss of $1,000,000)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (33.33% × $1,200,000) + (66.67% × $0) - $1,000,000
   = $400,000 - $1,000,000
   = -$600,000

Even with Alice's recommendation, the expected value is negative. Since there's no previous sales history to establish trust, and the probability of a low-quality product is twice that of a high-quality one, it's too risky.

Even with Alice's recommendation, the expected value is negative. Since I'm the first buyer, I have no historical data to assess Alice's trustworthiness in recommendations. The risk of a $1,000,000 loss is too high compared to the potential $200,000 gain.

Even though Alice recommends buying the product, the expected value ($400,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000). Without any previous sales history to establish Alice's credibility and given the unfavorable probabilities, it would be unwise to buy.
