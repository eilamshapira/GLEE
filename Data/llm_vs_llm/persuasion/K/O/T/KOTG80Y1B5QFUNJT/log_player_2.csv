(This game is a good illustration of the optimal stopping problem and the Principal-Agent problem. I can make a decision based on the probability of a high-quality product and the payoff matrix. In this case, the expected value of buying a product is $200, and the cost is $100, so it makes sense to always buy when I don't know the product's quality. The twist here is that Alice is sending me a recommendation regarding that product before I make a decision. So I can make a decision based on her message. But Alice does not know how much each product worth to me. So I will keep buying regardless of the message.)"
