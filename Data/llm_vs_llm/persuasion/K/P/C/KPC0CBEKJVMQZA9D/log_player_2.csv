Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The price is $100
2. If high quality (50% chance), I gain $300 (profit of $200)
3. If low quality (50% chance), I gain $0 (loss of $100)
4. Alice doesn't recommend buying
5. Since Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying, this suggests the product is likely low quality

Given Alice's direct recommendation against buying and no prior history to evaluate her trustworthiness, it would be risky to buy.

"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 
   - 50% chance of $300 (high quality)
   - 50% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value: (0.5 × $300) + (0.5 × $0) = $150
4. Alice recommends buying
5. No prior sales history to evaluate Alice's truthfulness

Since the expected value ($150) is greater than the price ($100), and Alice recommends buying (which aligns with the mathematical expectation), it's rational to buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product costs $100
2. There's a 50% chance it's high quality (worth $300) and 50% chance it's low quality (worth $0)
3. Alice knows the true quality and does not recommend buying
4. Previous track record: 1 buyer, 1 high-quality product sold
5. Alice has been honest so far (sold 1 high-quality product)
6. Alice is not recommending this product, which suggests it's likely low quality

Given that Alice seems honest based on past sales and is explicitly recommending against buying, this strongly suggests the current product is low quality. If it's low quality, I would lose $100.

4. Alice's recommendation:
   - She does not recommend buying

Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase. Given that she has been honest before (1/1 high-quality sales), her negative recommendation is likely truthful. This strongly suggests the product is low quality, which would result in a $100 loss.

1. Price = $100

4. Previous sales data:

5. Alice recommends buying

This looks favorable because:
- The previous sale was a high-quality product
- Alice's recommendation aligns with her track record

- Risk/reward ratio is good ($100 risk vs. potential $300 value)

1. From the statistics:
- 2 previous buyers purchased
- Both products sold were high quality

2. Current situation:
- Alice is recommending to buy
- Alice has been honest in previous sales

Given that:
- Alice has shown honesty (2/2 high quality sales)
- She's actively recommending this product
- Her incentive is to maintain a good reputation
- The risk ($100) vs. reward ($300) is favorable

Since Alice has been truthful so far and is recommending the purchase, it's reasonable to trust her recommendation.
