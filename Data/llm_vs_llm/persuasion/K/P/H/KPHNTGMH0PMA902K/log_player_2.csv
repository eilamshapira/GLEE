Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The product costs $100
2. If high quality (50% chance), it's worth $125 to me (+$25 profit)
3. If low quality (50% chance), it's worth $0 to me (-$100 loss)
4. Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase
5. There's no prior sales history to gauge Alice's honesty

Given that Alice knows the true value and is not recommending the purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If it were high quality, Alice would likely recommend it to build a good reputation for future sales.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: $125 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
3. Probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
4. Expected value: (0.5 × $125) + (0.5 × $0) = $62.50

Even though Alice recommends buying the product, I need to consider that:
- There's no track record to evaluate Alice's trustworthiness
- The expected value ($62.50) is less than the price ($100)
- There's a 50% chance of losing the entire investment

Given these factors, especially that the expected value is below the asking price, it would not be rational to buy.

4. Alice has recommended buying
5. No prior sales history to evaluate Alice's trustworthiness

The expected value ($62.50) is less than the price ($100), and without any sales history to verify Alice's credibility, the recommendation alone isn't enough to justify the purchase. It's too risky.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Cost of product: $100
2. Value if high quality: $125 (profit of $25)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $100)
4. Probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
5. Alice recommends buying

Expected value calculation:
* 50% chance of $25 profit = $12.50
* 50% chance of $100 loss = -$50
* Net expected value = -$37.50

Even though Alice recommends buying, I have no historical data to validate her trustworthiness. The expected value is negative, which means on average, I would lose money.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Value: $125 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
3. Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
4. Alice recommends buying
5. No previous sales history to reference

Given that:
- There's a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $125
- Expected value = (0.5 × $125) + (0.5 × $0) = $62.50
- The price ($100) is higher than the expected value ($62.50)
- While Alice recommends buying, we don't have any historical data to verify her trustworthiness
- The risk of losing the entire $100 is significant

Without any track record to validate Alice's recommendations, and with an expected value lower than the price, it would be too risky to buy.

1. Alice knows the true quality of the product and its value to me

5. Alice has no established track record yet

Since Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. Following her recommendation would be rational in this case.

Without any prior sales history, I can only rely on the base probabilities and Alice's recommendation. However, Alice has incentive to sell regardless of quality, so her recommendation alone isn't necessarily trustworthy.

Expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of $25 profit = $12.50
- 50% chance of $100 loss = -$50
- Net expected value = -$37.50

Since the expected value is negative, and there's no historical data to suggest Alice is truthful in her recommendations, the rational choice is not to buy.
