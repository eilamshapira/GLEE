Round 3
Alice's message: You've now purchased two products from me, and as promised, I disclosed their qualities afterwards. Both were low-quality. I want to assure you that I have high-quality products as well. The probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, as you know. I'm offering this new product for $10000, and I'll reveal its quality after your decision, just like before.

This new product is also available for $10000. Remember, the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, but I've had two high-quality products in a row now. I'll disclose the quality of this product after your purchase decision, as always.

Round 5
Alice's message: You've purchased four products so far, with two being low-quality and two being high-quality. I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and we've had a slight deviation from that probability in our recent transactions.

Round 6
Alice's message: You've now purchased five products, with three being low-quality and two being high-quality. It's interesting to note that we're getting close to the expected distribution based on the 33.33% probability of a product being high-quality. This new product is available for $10000, and I'll disclose its quality after your purchase decision. Perhaps this one will help us get even closer to the expected ratio.

Round 7
Alice's message: You've purchased six products, with three being low-quality and three being high-quality. We've reached a point where the actual ratio of high-quality to low-quality products is exactly 50%, which is higher than the expected 33.33% probability. This new product is available for $10000, and as always, I'll reveal its quality after your decision. It's worth considering whether this trend will continue or if we'll see a correction towards the expected probability.

Round 8
Alice's message: You've now purchased seven products, with three being low-quality and four being high-quality. The recent streak of high-quality products has been notable, but as we know, the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. This new product is available for $10000, and I'll disclose its quality after your decision. It's possible that we're due for a low-quality product to bring the ratio back in line with the expected probability.

Round 9
Alice's message: You've purchased eight products, with five being low-quality and three being high-quality. We've had two low-quality products in a row, which has brought the actual ratio closer to the expected 33.33% probability of a product being high-quality. This new product is available for $10000, and as before, I'll reveal its quality after your decision. The question is, will this trend continue or will we see a high-quality product soon?

Round 10
Alice's message: You've now purchased nine products, with six being low-quality and three being high-quality. We've had three low-quality products in a row, which has brought the actual ratio even closer to the expected 33.33% probability of a product being high-quality. This new product is available for $10000, and I'll disclose its quality after your decision. It's worth considering whether the probability will continue to assert itself and we'll see more low-quality products, or if we're due for a high-quality product to mix things up.

Round 11
Alice's message: You've purchased ten products, with seven being low-quality and three being high-quality. We've had four low-quality products in a row, which has actually surpassed the expected ratio based on the 33.33% probability of a product being high-quality. This new product is available for $10000, and as always, I'll reveal its quality after your decision. At this point, it's reasonable to wonder if the probability will eventually balance out and we'll see more high-quality products in the future.

We've had five low-quality products in a row, which is a significant deviation from the expected ratio. This new product is available for $10000, and I'll disclose its quality after your decision. It's getting increasingly likely that we're due for a high-quality product to rebalance the ratio, but the probability remains the same: 33.33% chance of a product being high-quality.

Round 13
Alice's message: You've purchased twelve products, with nine being low-quality and three being high-quality. We've had six low-quality products in a row, which made the recent appearance of a high-quality product unlikely but not impossible. This new product is available for $10000, and as always, I'll reveal its quality after your decision. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and it's interesting to consider whether this product will be the start of a new trend or just a singular occurrence.

This new product is available for $10000, and I'll disclose its quality after your decision. The probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%, but it's interesting to see if this recent trend will continue and bring the overall ratio closer to the expected probability.

We've had three high-quality products in a row, which has brought the actual ratio closer to the expected 33.33% probability of a product being high-quality, but still slightly above it. This new product is available for $10000, and as always, I'll reveal its quality after your decision. It's possible that we're due for a correction and a low-quality product will appear to bring the ratio back in line.
