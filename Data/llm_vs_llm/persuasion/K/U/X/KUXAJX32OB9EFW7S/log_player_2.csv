Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50% chance): $3,000,000
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (50% × $3,000,000) + (50% × $0) = $1,500,000

The expected value ($1,500,000) is higher than the price ($1,000,000), and Alice is recommending the purchase. While there's no historical data to verify Alice's trustworthiness, the mathematical expectation suggests this is a profitable decision.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price of product: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality: $3,000,000 (50% chance)
   - Low quality: $0 (50% chance)
3. Alice's track record:
   - 1 previous buyer
   - 1 sale made
   - 1 high-quality product sold (100% high quality so far)
4. Alice is recommending to buy

The fact that Alice's previous sale was a high-quality product and she's recommending this one is a positive sign. The expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of $3,000,000 = $1,500,000
- 50% chance of $0 = $0
- Expected value = $1,500,000

Since the expected value ($1,500,000) is greater than the price ($1,000,000), and Alice has a good track record so far with her recommendations, it's rational to buy.

1. Previous track record:
- 2 buyers made purchases
- 2 high-quality products were sold
- 100% success rate so far
- Alice has been honest with previous buyers

2. Current situation:
- Alice recommends buying
- Product costs $1,000,000
- If high quality: gain $3,000,000 (profit $2,000,000)
- If low quality: gain $0 (loss $1,000,000)
- 50-50 base probability

3. Decision factors:
- Alice's perfect track record suggests trustworthiness
- Her recommendation is positive
- Expected value given 50-50 odds: ($3M × 0.5 + $0 × 0.5) - $1M = $500,000

Given Alice's perfect track record and positive recommendation, the probability of a high-quality product likely exceeds 50%, making this a favorable investment.
