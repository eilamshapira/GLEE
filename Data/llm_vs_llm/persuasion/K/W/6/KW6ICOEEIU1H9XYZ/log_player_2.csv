**Reasoning:**

Since there's no historical data to go by, we rely on the expected value calculation.

* **Expected Value (EV) = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality)**
* **EV = (0.8 * $300) + (0.2 * $0) = $240**

The expected value is positive, meaning on average, buying the product is expected to be profitable.  While there's a risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward from a high-quality product outweighs the risk."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who knows the true quality of the product, is not recommending you buy it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.
* **Limited Data:** We have very little data to go on. Only one product has been sold, and it was high quality. This doesn't give us enough information to override Alice's recommendation. 

Since the potential loss is significant ($300) and the potential gain is minimal ($100), it's better to play it safe and pass."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  All previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation ended up with high-quality products. This suggests Alice is likely providing accurate information. 
* **Limited Risk:** The potential reward of $200 (value to you - price) outweighs the potential loss of $100. 

Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the high success rate of the previous buyers makes this a good gamble."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. This is a strong signal, as she knows the true quality and has an incentive to sell high-quality products to maximize her profits.
* **Past Sales Data:** 100% of the products sold so far have been high quality. This reinforces the positive signal from Alice's recommendation.

While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the information available strongly suggests a high-quality product.  The potential reward of $200 (difference between your value and the price) outweighs the risk."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation and the sales record both strongly suggest a high probability of the product being high quality.  While there's always a chance of it being low quality, the potential reward of a $300 product outweighs the risk of losing $100."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal.  Since all 7 previous buyers who followed her recommendation ended up with high-quality products, it's highly likely that this product is low-quality.

It's not worth the risk of losing $100 on a low-quality product."
