Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (80% chance): $12,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $12,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $9,600

While Alice recommends buying the product, I note that:
1. The expected value ($9,600) is less than the price ($10,000)
2. There's no track record to verify Alice's reliability
3. Alice has an incentive to sell regardless of quality

Given that the expected value is below the asking price, it would be rational to decline.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Product price: $10,000
2. Value if high quality: $12,000 (profit of $2,000)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $10,000)
4. Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
5. Alice recommends buying

Expected value calculation:
* 80% chance of winning $2,000
* 20% chance of losing $10,000
= (0.8 × $2,000) + (0.2 × -$10,000)
= $1,600 - $2,000
= -$400

Even though Alice recommends buying, the expected value is negative. Without any track record to establish Alice's credibility in recommendations, it's too risky.

1. Price is $10,000
2. The base probability of high quality is 80% (worth $12,000)
3. The base probability of low quality is 20% (worth $0)
4. Alice does NOT recommend buying
5. There's no prior sales history to help with the decision

Given that Alice doesn't recommend buying, this might suggest that she has seen it's low quality. While the base probability of high quality is good (80%), the seller's negative recommendation is a strong signal that this particular product might be low quality.

If it's low quality, I would lose the entire $10,000 investment. If it's high quality, I would only gain $2,000 ($12,000 - $10,000).

Given the seller's negative recommendation and the asymmetric risk/reward ratio, I should decline.
