Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze whether to buy the product based on:
1) The prior probability (80% high quality, 20% low quality)
2) Alice's recommendation (negative)
3) The expected value calculation

Alice doesn't recommend buying, which suggests the product might be low quality. Since Alice knows the true quality, her recommendation likely has meaningful information.

Given:
- Prior probability of high quality: 80%
- High-quality product value: $40,000
- Low-quality product value: $0
- Cost: $10,000
- Alice's recommendation: negative

The expected value without Alice's recommendation would be:
0.8 × $40,000 + 0.2 × $0 - $10,000 = $32,000 - $10,000 = $22,000

But since Alice doesn't recommend buying, and she knows the true quality, I should significantly lower my probability estimate of high quality. Her negative recommendation strongly suggests this is a low-quality product, making the expected value less than the $10,000 cost.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to decide whether to buy a product for $10,000 that could be worth either $40,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality).

Facts:
- Prior probability: 80% chance of high quality, 20% chance of low quality
- Expected value before recommendation = 0.8 × $40,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $32,000
- Alice doesn't recommend buying the product
- Alice knows the true quality

Alice's recommendation against buying strongly suggests the product is low quality. If Alice is honest and knowledgeable, I should take her recommendation seriously, as she knows the true quality.

Given Alice doesn't recommend buying, the product is very likely low quality, which would be worth $0 to me. Paying $10,000 for a product worth $0 would be a bad decision.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to decide whether to buy this product based on the given information. 

The base probability is 80% for a high-quality product worth $40,000 to me, and 20% for a low-quality product worth $0.

However, Alice (who knows the true quality) is not recommending that I buy the product. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality, as Alice has no incentive to discourage me from buying a high-quality product.

Given Alice's negative recommendation, the probability that this is a low-quality product is much higher than the base 20% rate. Even though the expected value of a random product would be positive (0.8 × $40,000 = $32,000, which exceeds the $10,000 price), Alice's recommendation suggests this specific product is likely not worth the $10,000 price.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully.

Given information:
- The price is $10,000
- High-quality product (80% chance) is worth $40,000 to me
- Low-quality product (20% chance) is worth $0 to me
- Alice recommends buying the product
- No sales history is available yet

Expected value calculation:
- If I buy: (0.8 × $40,000) + (0.2 × $0) - $10,000 = $32,000 - $10,000 = $22,000
- If I don't buy: $0

Since the expected value of buying ($22,000) is greater than not buying ($0), it's rational to purchase the product. Even without any sales history, the base probability of getting a high-quality product makes this a positive expected value decision.

3. Alice knows the true quality of the product and its value to me
4. The product costs $10,000 and would be worth $40,000 if high quality or $0 if low quality

Since Alice is not recommending the purchase and she knows the true quality, this is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. If I bought a low-quality product, I would lose my $10,000 investment.

1) Prior probability of high quality: 80%
2) Expected value without additional information:

3) Alice's recommendation provides additional information:
   - Alice has sold 1 product so far, and it was high quality

- Low-quality product value to me: $0
- Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice recommends buying the product
- Previous sales: 2 buyers purchased, 2 high-quality products sold

Alice has only sold high-quality products so far, which is a positive signal. She also recommends I buy this product.

The expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 0.8 × $40,000 + 0.2 × $0 - $10,000 = $32,000 - $10,000 = $22,000

Given information:
- The price is $10,000
- A high-quality product is worth $40,000 to me (profit: $30,000)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss: $10,000)
- Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice's track record: 3 out of 3 previous sales were high quality
- Alice recommends me to buy the product

Alice's perfect track record (3/3 high quality products sold) suggests her recommendations are reliable. If I trust her recommendation, my expected value would be positive:

Expected value = 0.8 × $30,000 + 0.2 × (-$10,000) = $24,000 - $2,000 = $22,000

Since the expected value is significantly positive, and Alice's track record supports her credibility, buying is the rational choice.

- Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice has sold 5 products, all high quality (100% high-quality track record)
- Alice recommends buying this product

The fact that Alice has only sold high-quality products so far and is recommending this product is a positive signal. While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product based on the prior probability, Alice's perfect track record suggests she might be honest or selective in her recommendations.

Expected value calculation:

2. The product costs $10,000.
3. Alice has sold to 7 buyers so far, and all 7 products sold were high quality.
4. Alice recommends that I buy the current product.

Given that all previous sales resulted in high-quality products and Alice is recommending this purchase, it suggests her recommendations are reliable. The expected value calculation also strongly favors purchasing:

Alice has sold 8 products so far, and all 8 were high-quality. Alice is now recommending that I buy the current product.

The baseline probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and high-quality products are worth $40,000 to me (while the price is $10,000). Alice's perfect track record of selling only high-quality products and her current recommendation suggest that the product is likely high-quality.

The expected value of buying is:
- If high-quality (which seems very likely): $40,000 - $10,000 = $30,000 profit
- If low-quality: $0 - $10,000 = -$10,000 loss
