Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (80% chance): $4,000,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(80% × $4,000,000) + (20% × $0) = $3,200,000

The expected value ($3,200,000) is significantly higher than the price ($1,000,000), and Alice recommends buying. Even though there's no previous sales history to validate Alice's credibility, the basic probability makes this a positive expected value decision.

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($4,000,000) = $3,200,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $3,200,000

2. Cost of product = $1,000,000

3. Additional information:
- Previous buyer bought and received a high-quality product
- Alice is recommending this product
- The success rate so far (100%) aligns with or exceeds the stated probability (80%)

Since the expected value ($3,200,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($1,000,000), and both the historical data and Alice's recommendation are positive indicators, this appears to be a good investment opportunity.

1. Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality: 0.8 × $4,000,000 = $3,200,000
- 20% chance of low quality: 0.2 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $3,200,000

2. Cost of purchase = $1,000,000

3. Trust factors:
- Previous track record shows 2/2 high-quality products sold
- Alice is providing a positive recommendation
- The probability distribution (80% high quality) is favorable

4. Decision logic:
- Expected value ($3,200,000) > Cost ($1,000,000)
- Historical performance supports the probability
- Seller's recommendation aligns with positive expected outcome

Given that the expected value significantly exceeds the cost, and the historical data supports the base probability, this appears to be a good investment.
