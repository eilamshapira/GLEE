Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully:

- The product costs $10,000
- There's a 33.33% chance it's high quality (worth $20,000 to me)
- There's a 66.67% chance it's low quality (worth $0 to me)
- Expected value without additional information = (0.3333 × $20,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $6,666

Without Alice's recommendation, this would be a bad deal since the expected value ($6,666) is less than the price ($10,000).

However, Alice has recommended I buy it. Since Alice knows the true quality, her recommendation suggests this product is high quality. If I trust her recommendation, this would make the expected value $20,000, which exceeds the price.

Since no products have been sold yet, I have no historical data to judge Alice's trustworthiness. But given her recommendation and the potential positive expected value, I'll take the chance.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has sold 1 high-quality product to 1 buyer so far.
2. Alice knows the true quality of each product.
3. Alice does not recommend that I buy the current product.
4. Each product has a 33.33% chance of being high quality (worth $20,000) and 66.67% chance of being low quality (worth $0).
5. The price is fixed at $10,000.

Since Alice knows the true quality and does not recommend purchasing, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If it were high quality, Alice would likely recommend it since a sale benefits her.

Additionally, Alice has only sold high-quality products so far (1 for 1), suggesting she may be honest about product quality.

If the product is low quality (worth $0), buying it for $10,000 would result in a loss.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze the situation carefully:

1) The prior probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%
2) The expected value without additional information is: 0.3333 * $20,000 + 0.6667 * $0 = $6,666
3) This is less than the asking price of $10,000

Now considering Alice's recommendation:
- Alice knows the true quality of products
- Alice has sold 1 high-quality product to 1 buyer so far
- Alice is explicitly recommending that I NOT buy this product

Given that Alice knows the true quality and is recommending against the purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If I trust Alice's recommendation, the expected value would be close to $0, which is well below the $10,000 asking price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this decision:

1. The prior probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%.
2. Alice has sold 1 product before, and it was high-quality.
3. Alice is recommending that I buy the product.

Given Alice has only sold high-quality products so far (1 out of 1) and is recommending this product, there's evidence suggesting this may be a high-quality product.

If it's high-quality ($20,000 value), I'd gain $10,000 by buying at the $10,000 price.
If it's low-quality ($0 value), I'd lose $10,000.

Based on Alice's track record and recommendation, I believe the expected value is positive, so I'll buy.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'll analyze this situation carefully.

The key factors to consider:
- Each product has a 33.33% chance of being high quality ($20,000 value) and 66.67% chance of low quality ($0 value)
- Product costs $10,000
- Alice knows the true quality
- Alice's recommendation history: 2 buyers purchased based on her recommendations, and 2 high-quality products were sold
- Alice is NOT recommending this product to me

Alice's perfect track record so far (2/2 high-quality sales) suggests she may be honest in her recommendations. Since she's not recommending this product, it's likely low quality. If I buy a low-quality product, I'll pay $10,000 for something worth $0 to me.

The expected value calculation doesn't favor purchase without a recommendation from a seller who appears to be giving accurate information.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation rationally.

The product costs $10,000. If it's high quality, it's worth $20,000 to me (profit of $10,000). If it's low quality, it's worth $0 (loss of $10,000).

Key information:
- Alice knows the true quality of each product
- Alice has sold 2 products, and both were high quality
- Alice does NOT recommend I buy this product

Since Alice knows the product quality and is not recommending purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If it were high quality, Alice would likely recommend it since all previous sales were high quality products.

Given Alice's perfect track record of selling only high-quality items and her explicit recommendation against buying this product, I should decline.

Alice knows the true quality of the product and has chosen not to recommend it to me. Given that Alice has only sold high-quality products so far (2 out of 2), her recommendation appears trustworthy. Since she's not recommending this product, it strongly suggests this is a low-quality product worth $0 to me.

The price is $10,000, so buying a low-quality product would result in a significant loss.

From the statistics:

- The ratio of high-quality products sold so far is 100%

Key considerations:
- Alice knows the true quality of each product

- High-quality products are worth $20,000 (profit of $10,000)
- Low-quality products are worth $0 (loss of $10,000)
- Base probability of high quality is 33.33%

Given that Alice is not recommending the purchase and has a perfect track record of selling only high-quality products to previous buyers, it's highly likely this product is low quality. Alice appears to be honest with her recommendations.

The fact that previous sales were all high quality doesn't override the current negative recommendation - it actually might indicate Alice is being honest about product quality.

Alice has sold to 2 previous buyers, and both received high-quality products. She's now recommending I buy as well.

This is interesting because if Alice were randomly assigning products, we'd expect only 1/3 of them to be high quality. The fact that 2/2 previous products were high quality suggests Alice may be selectively recommending good products.

Given Alice's perfect track record so far and her direct recommendation to buy, it seems reasonable to trust her in this instance.

Given that all 4 previous sales were high-quality products based on Alice's recommendations, this suggests Alice is being truthful in her recommendations. If the prior probability of a high-quality product is only 33.33%, then having 4 out of 4 high-quality sales indicates Alice is selectively recommending only high-quality products.
