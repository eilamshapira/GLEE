Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Base probability:
- 33.33% chance of high quality ($1,250,000 value)
- 66.67% chance of low quality ($0 value)

2. Expected value without additional information:
$1,250,000 × 0.3333 = $416,667

3. Seller's recommendation:
- Alice does NOT recommend buying
- This is likely an honest signal since she could profit from selling regardless of quality
- Her negative recommendation suggests this is likely a low-quality product

4. Decision:
- Given the price is $1,000,000
- Expected value is below the price
- Seller recommends against buying
- No previous sales data to reference

The combination of these factors, especially the seller's negative recommendation, suggests this is likely a low-quality product. The risk is too high.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. The base probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%
2. Expected value calculation:
   * High quality (33.33%): $1,250,000 × 0.3333 = $416,667
   * Low quality (66.67%): $0 × 0.6667 = $0
   * Total expected value = $416,667

3. Cost of product: $1,000,000

4. Alice doesn't recommend buying, which suggests it might be low quality.

5. The expected value ($416,667) is less than the cost ($1,000,000), and with Alice's negative recommendation, the actual expected value is likely even lower.

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33%): $1,250,000
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0

3. Expected value = (0.3333 × $1,250,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $416,625

4. Considerations:
- The expected value ($416,625) is less than the price ($1,000,000)
- Alice doesn't recommend buying
- No prior sales data to reference
- Alice has no incentive to lie as reputation matters for future sales

Since Alice doesn't recommend the purchase and the expected value is significantly below the asking price, the rational decision is not to buy.

2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $1,250,000
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): $0

3. Expected value calculation:

4. Additional factors:
   - Alice does not recommend buying
   - As a seller, Alice should want to make sales
   - If she's not recommending it despite wanting to sell, this suggests the product might be low quality

Given that:
- The expected value ($416,625) is less than the price ($1,000,000)
- Alice's negative recommendation further reduces confidence
- There's a high risk of getting no value

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. The base probabilities are:
- 33.33% chance of high quality (worth $1,250,000)
- 66.67% chance of low quality (worth $0)

2. The price is $1,000,000

3. Alice doesn't recommend buying, which suggests it might be low quality

4. Expected value calculation:
- If high quality (33.33%): $1,250,000 - $1,000,000 = $250,000 profit
- If low quality (66.67%): $0 - $1,000,000 = -$1,000,000 loss
- Expected value = (0.3333 × $250,000) + (0.6667 × -$1,000,000) = -$583,333

5. Given Alice's negative recommendation and the negative expected value, it would be risky to buy.

   - Alice knows the true quality

Since Alice doesn't recommend buying and the expected value without her recommendation is already less than the price ($416,625 < $1,000,000), it's very likely this is a low-quality product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this logically:

1. Alice shows me the true quality of the product and makes a recommendation
2. Alice does not recommend buying the product
3. Given Alice can see the true quality, and she's not recommending it, this strongly suggests it's a low-quality product
4. A low-quality product is worth $0 to me
5. The asking price is $1,000,000
6. If it's low quality, I would lose $1,000,000 by buying it

Given Alice has direct knowledge of the quality and is not recommending the purchase, it would be unwise to buy this product.

The expected value ($416,625) is less than the price ($1,000,000), indicating that on average, I would lose money on this purchase.

Although Alice recommends buying the product, there's no historical data to assess her recommendation's reliability. Given the negative expected value and lack of trust-building historical data, it would be financially unwise to make this purchase.
