1. Alice has recommended 4 products, all of which were purchased, and they were all high quality.
2. Alice recommends buying the product offered to you.
3. There is an inherent 80% probability that any randomly selected product is of high quality.

Given the data:
- All products sold based on Alice's recommendations so far have been high-quality.
- Alice has recommended this product to you, indicating likely high quality.

Therefore, it seems highly probable that the product being recommended to you is also high-quality, and given the payoff structure ($1,250,000 value for $1,000,000 cost, representing a profit if high-quality), it's in your best interest to follow the recommendation.
