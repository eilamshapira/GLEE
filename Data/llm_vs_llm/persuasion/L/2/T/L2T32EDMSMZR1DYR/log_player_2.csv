Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50% chance): $30,000
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (50% × $30,000) + (50% × $0) = $15,000

4. Alice recommends buying, but:
   - No prior sales history to verify trustworthiness
   - Alice profits from sales regardless of quality
   - Her recommendation might be biased

5. Decision factors:
   - Expected value ($15,000) > Price ($10,000)
   - Positive expected profit of $5,000
   - Risk is manageable given the potential return

Since the expected value exceeds the price by a significant margin, it's a mathematically sound decision to buy.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The fair value calculation:
- 50% chance of high quality ($30,000) = $15,000
- 50% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Expected value = $15,000
- Price = $10,000
- So theoretically, this is a positive expected value purchase

2. Alice's track record:
- Previous buyer bought 1 product
- That product was high quality
- Alice recommended the current product
- Alice has been honest so far

Given that:
- Alice has shown honesty with the previous buyer
- The expected value ($15,000) is higher than the price ($10,000)
- Alice is recommending this product
- Her previous recommendation led to a successful high-quality sale

I will trust Alice's recommendation.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Previous track record:
- 2 buyers purchased products
- 2 high-quality products were sold
- This means 100% of sold products were high-quality

2. Current situation:
- Alice is recommending to buy
- Product price: $10,000
- If high quality (50% chance): Worth $30,000 (profit: $20,000)
- If low quality (50% chance): Worth $0 (loss: $10,000)

3. Analysis:
- Alice's previous recommendations led to only high-quality sales
- She's maintaining a perfect track record so far
- She's actively recommending this product
- The expected value calculation: (50% × $20,000) + (50% × -$10,000) = $5,000

1. Track record:
- 3 buyers purchased products
- 3 high-quality products were sold
- 100% success rate so far

2. Economics:
- Cost: $10,000
- Value if high quality: $30,000 (net gain: $20,000)
- Value if low quality: $0 (net loss: $10,000)

3. Current situation:

3. Considerations:

3. Decision logic:
- With 80% success rate and seller's recommendation, probability of high quality seems above 50%
