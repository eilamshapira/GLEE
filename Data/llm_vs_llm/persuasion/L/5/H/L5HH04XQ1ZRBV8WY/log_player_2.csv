Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 
   - 50% chance of $300 (high quality)
   - 50% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value: (0.5 × $300) + (0.5 × $0) = $150
4. Alice recommends buying
5. No historical data to rely on

Since the expected value ($150) is higher than the price ($100), and Alice is recommending the purchase, it's rational to buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Previous statistics:
- 1 buyer made a purchase
- 1 high-quality product was sold
- This indicates a 100% success rate so far

2. Current situation:
- Alice recommends buying
- Alice knows the true value
- Her track record shows honesty (1/1 high quality)
- Price is $100, potential value is $300 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)

3. Decision factors:
- Alice's recommendation is positive
- Previous track record is perfect
- Expected value calculation: 
  - If Alice is honest, getting a $300 value for $100 is a good deal

Given Alice's perfect track record and her positive recommendation, this seems like a good opportunity.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price = $100
2. High quality value = $300 (50% chance)
3. Low quality value = $0 (50% chance)
4. Previous sales:
   - 2 buyers purchased
   - 2 high-quality products sold

5. Alice recommends buying

Given that:
- Alice has been honest so far (2/2 high-quality products)
- She's recommending this product
- Her past recommendations have been reliable
- The expected value is positive if the product is likely high quality

This appears to be a trustworthy situation with a good track record, and Alice's recommendation carries weight given her perfect history.

Given that:
- Alice has shown perfect accuracy in previous sales
- She's actively recommending against this purchase
- She knows the true quality
- She has no incentive to lie

The logical conclusion is that this must be a low-quality product, which would be worth $0 to me. Buying it for $100 would result in a guaranteed loss.
