"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this strategically.

In this case:
- The product costs $10,000
- If it's high quality, I gain $20,000 (net profit $10,000)
- If it's low quality, I gain $0 (net loss $10,000)
- Base probability is 50-50
- Alice has recommended to buy

While Alice's recommendation could be strategic, with the 50-50 base probability, my expected value is:
(50% × $20,000) + (50% × $0) = $10,000

Since the expected value equals the cost, and Alice has recommended to buy, I'll take the risk.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's first recommendation was honest and led to a profitable outcome. While this could be part of a longer-term strategy, for now I have a positive data point about Alice's recommendations.

The base economics remain the same:
- Cost: $10,000
- Potential high-quality value: $20,000 (profit $10,000)
- Potential low-quality value: $0 (loss $10,000)
- Base probability: 50-50
- Alice has recommended to buy again
- Previous recommendation from Alice was truthful

Given that Alice's previous recommendation was truthful and led to profit, and she's recommending again, I'll continue to trust her recommendation for now.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Interesting development. Let's analyze:

1. Alice has been truthful in her first two recommendations:
   - Both times she recommended to buy, the products were high quality
   - Her recommendations have led to profitable outcomes

2. Now, for the first time, she's recommending NOT to buy:
   - This suggests she might be honest about product quality
   - If she was purely self-interested, she would always recommend buying
   - The fact that she's willing to recommend against buying adds credibility

3. Given her track record of honesty so far, and that she's now explicitly recommending against buying, this product is likely low quality.

Following Alice's apparent honest signaling pattern, I should avoid this purchase.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze Alice's behavior pattern so far:

1. Round 1: Recommended buy -> High quality (Truthful)
2. Round 2: Recommended buy -> High quality (Truthful)
3. Round 3: Recommended NOT buy -> Low quality (Truthful)
4. Now: Recommends buy

Alice has demonstrated a perfect track record of honest recommendations so far. She has:
- Recommended buying when products were high quality
- Advised against buying when the product was low quality
- Could have tried to sell the low-quality product but chose not to

This builds strong confidence in her recommendations. She appears to be maintaining her reputation for honest signaling rather than trying to maximize short-term profits.

Given her consistent honesty and current recommendation to buy, I'll continue to trust her.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.
