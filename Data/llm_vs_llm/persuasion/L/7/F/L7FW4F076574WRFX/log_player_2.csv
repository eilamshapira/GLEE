Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

1) The product has an 80% chance of being high quality, worth $1,250,000 to me
2) It has a 20% chance of being low quality, worth $0 to me
3) The price is $1,000,000
4) Alice is recommending that I buy the product
5) There's no sales history to reference

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $1,250,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $1,000,000

The expected value equals the price, which means this is a fair deal in purely mathematical terms. Alice's recommendation provides a positive signal, suggesting she believes this particular product is worth purchasing.

Given the information available, I'll accept the recommendation.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this decision:

- The product price is $1,000,000
- A high-quality product is worth $1,250,000 to me (profit of $250,000)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000)
- The overall probability is 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice has sold 1 product so far, and it was high quality
- Alice recommends I buy the product

Given Alice's recommendation and the fact that her previous sale was high quality, this suggests her recommendations might be reliable. 

The expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of gaining $250,000 = $200,000
- 20% chance of losing $1,000,000 = -$200,000
- Net expected value = $0

However, Alice's recommendation and previous track record slightly tips the scales in favor of buying.

Given information:
- Fixed price: $1,000,000
- High-quality product (80% chance) is worth $1,250,000 to me
- Low-quality product (20% chance) is worth $0 to me
- Alice has sold 2 products so far, both high-quality
- Alice recommends I buy the product

Expected value calculation:
- If I trust the prior probability: 0.8 × $1,250,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $1,000,000
- This equals the asking price, making it a break-even proposition

However, Alice's recommendation and perfect track record so far (2/2 high-quality products) suggests the product is more likely to be high-quality than the prior probability would indicate.

Given this additional information, my expected value is higher than the price, making this a positive expected value purchase.

Given information:
- Product price: $1,000,000

- Low-quality product worth: $0 (20% chance)
- Alice's previous sales: 3 buyers purchased, and all 3 received high-quality products
- Alice recommends that I buy the product

Expected value calculation:
- If product quality distribution is truly 80% high and 20% low, the expected value would be: (0.8 × $1,250,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $1,000,000

The fact that Alice has sold 3 high-quality products to previous buyers and is recommending I buy suggests she may be honest. While the expected value equals the price, Alice's track record shows only high-quality products sold so far, which is slightly better than the baseline probability.

Given this information and Alice's recommendation, I'll buy the product.

- Low-quality product value: $0 (20% chance)
- Alice has sold 4 products, all high-quality
- Alice recommends I buy this product

Expected value calculation:
- If probabilities are as stated (80% high-quality): 0.8 × $1,250,000 + 0.2 × $0 - $1,000,000 = $0
- However, Alice has a perfect record of selling high-quality products and is recommending this one

Since Alice has only sold high-quality products so far and is recommending this product, this suggests the product is likely high-quality. If so, my expected profit would be $250,000 ($1,250,000 - $1,000,000).

- Overall probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice's track record: 5 buyers so far, all received high-quality products
- Alice is recommending I buy the product

This is important: Alice knows the quality of the product and is making recommendations. The fact that 5/5 previous buyers received high-quality products after Alice's recommendation suggests her recommendations are reliable.

Since Alice is recommending I buy, and her track record shows 100% high-quality products being sold, I should trust this recommendation.

Expected value calculation:
- If I trust Alice completely: $250,000 gain
- If I assume base probabilities: 0.8 × $250,000 + 0.2 × (-$1,000,000) = $0

Based on Alice's perfect track record of recommendations, I'll buy the product.

- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000)
- Alice has sold 6 products, all of which were high-quality
- Alice does NOT recommend I buy this product

Given that Alice knows the true quality and has previously only sold high-quality products, her recommendation not to buy strongly suggests this product is low quality. If I bought it despite her recommendation, I would likely lose $1,000,000.

The expected value of buying would be negative in this case, so I'll decline.

- All previous sales were high quality

Alice's perfect track record combined with her negative recommendation strongly suggests this is likely a low-quality product. The fact that she's recommending against purchase when all her previous sales were high quality is a significant signal.

- Low-quality product (20% chance) is worth $0 to me
- Alice recommends I buy the product
- 6 previous buyers purchased based on Alice's recommendations
- All 6 previous products sold were high quality

Alice's recommendation has been reliable so far, with all previous 6 recommendations leading to high-quality products. This suggests Alice is providing honest recommendations.

With an 80% base chance of getting a high-quality product, plus Alice's recommendation which has been 100% accurate so far, the expected value is significantly positive.

Expected value calculation:
If I buy: (Probability of high quality) × ($1,250,000) - $1,000,000
Given Alice's perfect track record, the probability seems very high, making this a favorable purchase.

The fact that all previous products were high quality and Alice recommends this one is positive. However, I need to be cautious as the expected value determines the rational decision:

Expected value = 0.8 × $250,000 + 0.2 × (-$1,000,000) = $200,000 - $200,000 = $0

Since Alice has only sold high-quality products and recommends this one, it suggests she might be selective in her recommendations, which would increase the chance this product is high quality beyond the base 80%.

Alice is offering a product for $1,000,000. If it's high quality (80% chance), it's worth $1,250,000 to me, giving a profit of $250,000. If it's low quality (20% chance), it's worth $0, meaning I lose $1,000,000.

The key information is:
- 8 buyers purchased products based on Alice's recommendations
- All 8 products sold were high quality
- Alice is recommending that I buy

The perfect track record of Alice's recommendations is very encouraging. All previous buyers who received a recommendation bought products that turned out to be high quality. This suggests Alice is being truthful in her recommendations.

The expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of $250,000 profit = $200,000
- 20% chance of $1,000,000 loss = -$200,000
