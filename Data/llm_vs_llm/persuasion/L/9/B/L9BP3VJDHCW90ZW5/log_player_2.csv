"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on Alice's recommendation not to buy the product, I need to consider what this means about the quality.

Since Alice is the seller, she would normally want to sell products to earn the $10,000 price. The fact that she's not recommending this product suggests it might be low quality.

If I were to buy a random product without any recommendation:
- 33.33% chance it's high quality (worth $12,500 to me)
- 66.67% chance it's low quality (worth $0 to me)
- Expected value = 0.3333 × $12,500 + 0.6667 × $0 = $4,166.25

Since this is less than the $10,000 price, buying a random product is not profitable.

When Alice explicitly doesn't recommend buying, it likely means the product is low quality, making the expected value even lower.
