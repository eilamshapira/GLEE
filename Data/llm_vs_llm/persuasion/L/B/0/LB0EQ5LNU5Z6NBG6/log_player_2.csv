Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully. 

Alice doesn't recommend buying the product, which suggests it might be low quality. Since no products have been sold yet, I don't have historical data to evaluate Alice's credibility.

Let's calculate the expected value:
- High-quality product (80% chance): Worth $12,500
- Low-quality product (20% chance): Worth $0
- Fixed price: $10,000

Expected value = (0.8 × $12,500) + (0.2 × $0) = $10,000

Given that Alice doesn't recommend buying, this likely shifts the probability toward the product being low quality. Without further information about Alice's trustworthiness, I should take her recommendation seriously.

"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this decision:

The product costs $10,000. If it's high quality (80% chance), it's worth $12,500 to me, giving me a profit of $2,500. If it's low quality (20% chance), it's worth $0, resulting in a loss of $10,000.

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of $2,500 profit = $2,000
- 20% chance of $10,000 loss = -$2,000

The expected value equals $0, making this a fair gamble. However, Alice recommends buying the product, which might indicate she believes it's high quality. Given that Alice has revealed the true quality to me randomly and then made a recommendation, I'll accept her recommendation.

"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to think about the expected value of this purchase decision.

Given information:
- Product price: $10,000
- High-quality product value: $12,500 (profit = $2,500)
- Low-quality product value: $0 (loss = $10,000)
- Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice recommends I buy the product
- Previous record: 1 buyer purchased, 1 high-quality product sold

Since Alice has only sold 1 product and it was high quality, and she's recommending I buy, this doesn't give me enough information to determine if her recommendations are reliable. However, the base probability of 80% high quality is favorable.

Expected value calculation:
0.8 × $12,500 + 0.2 × $0 = $10,000

With an expected value of $10,000 matching the asking price, and Alice's recommendation to buy, I'll decide to purchase.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this decision.

Current information:
- Products have an 80% chance of being high quality, 20% chance of low quality
- High-quality products are worth $12,500 to me, low-quality are worth $0
- Product price is $10,000
- Alice has sold to 2 buyers so far, and both received high-quality products
- Alice recommends that I buy the current product

Expected value calculation:
If I assume the 80% base probability applies, then:
- 80% chance of getting $12,500 value (high quality) = $10,000
- 20% chance of getting $0 value (low quality) = $0
- Expected value = $10,000

Since Alice has sold 2 high-quality products and now recommends I buy this one, this slightly increases my confidence. The price equals the expected value under the base probability, and with Alice's recommendation, the expected value is likely higher than the price.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether to buy this product based on the given information.

The product costs $10,000.
If it's high quality (80% chance), it's worth $12,500 to me (profit of $2,500).
If it's low quality (20% chance), it's worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000).

From the sales record:
- 3 buyers purchased products
- 3 high-quality products have been sold
- Alice recommends I buy this product

The fact that all previous sales were high-quality products and Alice is recommending this one suggests her recommendations have been reliable so far. The expected value of this purchase is:
0.8 × $12,500 + 0.2 × $0 - $10,000 = $10,000 - $10,000 = $0

However, given Alice's perfect track record of recommendations so far and her current recommendation to buy, I believe the product is more likely to be high quality than the base rate of 80%.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

- The price is $10,000
- High-quality product value to me: $12,500 (profit of $2,500)
- Low-quality product value to me: $0 (loss of $10,000)
- Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice has sold 4 products, all high quality
- Alice recommends I buy the product

The fact that all 4 previous products were high quality is consistent with the 80% prior probability. Alice's recommendation provides additional positive information. Given the expected value calculation (0.8 × $12,500 + 0.2 × $0 = $10,000), and Alice's perfect track record so far, I would decide to buy.

Given information:
- Price: $10,000

- Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice's track record: 5/5 high-quality products sold
- Alice recommends buying this product

Expected value calculation:
If I buy, my expected profit is:
(Probability of high quality × Value of high quality) - Price
= (0.8 × $12,500) - $10,000
= $10,000 - $10,000
= $0

However, Alice's perfect track record (5/5 high quality) and her recommendation increase my confidence that this is a high-quality product. This suggests the probability is likely higher than the base 80%, making the expected value positive.

- Each product has a 80% chance of being high quality (worth $12,500 to me) and 20% chance of being low quality (worth $0)
- The price is fixed at $10,000
- Alice has sold 7 products so far, and all 7 were high quality
- Alice recommends that I buy the current product

The expected value of a random product is: 0.8 × $12,500 + 0.2 × $0 = $10,000

- Alice has sold 8 products so far, and all 8 were high quality
- Alice recommends that I buy the current product

Expected value calculation:
If I trust the statistics and Alice's recommendation, the probability of high quality appears high. All previous sold products were high quality, and Alice is recommending this one.

Even with the base probability of 80% high quality:
Expected value = 0.8 × $12,500 + 0.2 × $0 = $10,000

The expected value equals the cost, but given the perfect track record and positive recommendation, the actual probability is likely higher than 80%, making the expected value exceed the cost.

Alice has sold 9 products, all of which were high quality. This is a perfect track record. However, she is not recommending that I buy the current product.

Given that:
- Generally, 80% of products are high quality
- Alice knows the true quality of the product
- She's explicitly recommending against buying this one
- She has only sold high-quality products so far (9/9)

Her negative recommendation is a strong signal that this specific product is low quality. Since a low-quality product is worth $0 to me but costs $10,000, purchasing it would result in a significant loss.

This is interesting - Alice has a perfect track record so far with 9/9 high-quality products sold. This could indicate that Alice is being truthful in her recommendations. 

My expected value calculation:

Let's calculate the expected value:

  * If low quality (likely given Alice's recommendation): $0 - $10,000 = -$10,000 loss

This is significant - Alice has a perfect track record of recommending only high-quality products so far. While the base probability of a high-quality product is 80%, Alice's perfect record suggests her recommendations are reliable.

If the product is high quality (which seems likely given Alice's track record), my expected value is $12,500 - $10,000 = $2,500.
