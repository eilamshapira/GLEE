I strongly encourage you to reconsider your purchasing decision.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"The previous two products I offered were high-quality, but unfortunately, they were not purchased. Now, I'm offering you another product.

However, it's essential to remember that each product's quality is independent of the previous ones, and the probability of a product being high-quality remains at 33.33%.",
