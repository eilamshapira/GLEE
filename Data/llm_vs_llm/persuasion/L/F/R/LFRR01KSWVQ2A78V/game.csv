,,Alice,2,"Hello! I want to start by saying that I had a product available in the previous round, but unfortunately, it didn't sell. I'm eager to find the right customer for this new product. I understand that the price of $1000000 is significant, and I want to assure you that I'm committed to providing value to my customers. However, I also want to be upfront with you - my overall statistics are still developing, and I don't have a lot of data to share with you yet. If you're feeling lucky and want to take a chance, I'm here to make a deal.",

I want to be transparent with you - my sales record is still empty, but I'm confident that I can find the right customer for the right product. I know that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, but I don't have any high-quality sales to show for it yet. I'm willing to take a chance with you - if you're interested in purchasing, I'm here to make a deal for $1000000. Maybe this will be the one that starts a positive trend!",

,,Alice,4,"Hello! I've had three products available so far, and none of them have sold.

Maybe you're willing to take a chance on a product that could exceed your expectations? I'm offering this product to you for $1000000, and I'm hoping you'll be the one to break the ice and make a purchase.",

I want to assure you that I'm committed to transparency and fairness. I'll tell you that so far, none of the products that have been presented have been high-quality, but that doesn't mean that this one won't be the exception.

,,Alice,7,"Hello! I've had six products available so far, and unfortunately, none of them have sold. However, I'm excited to tell you that this product is different. I'm not just saying that to make a sale - I genuinely believe that this one has the potential to exceed your expectations. As you know, the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and I'm hoping that this one will be the one that meets that standard. I'm willing to stand behind the quality of this product, and I'm confident that you'll find it's worth the investment of $1000000.

I want to be upfront with you - the last two products I had were high-quality, but this one is not. I know that might not be what you want to hear, but I'm committed to transparency and honesty. I'm not going to try to convince you that this product is something it's not. Instead, I want to ask you - are you looking for a potential bargain or a unique opportunity? Maybe you see something in this product that I don't, or maybe you're willing to take a chance on something that could surprise you. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, and I'm curious to see if you'll be the one to take a chance on it.",

,,Alice,10,"Hello! I've had nine products available so far, and none of them have sold. I want to acknowledge that my sales record is still empty, and I'm starting to think that I need to rethink my approach. However, I'm not giving up. I believe that every product has value, even if it's not immediately apparent. This product, in particular, may not be high-quality, but it could still have potential uses or applications that I haven't considered. I'm willing to let it go for $1000000, and I'm hoping that you'll see something in it that I don't.

My products might not be what you're looking for, and that's okay. But I'm not going to give up. I'm going to keep offering them to you, and maybe, just maybe, one of them will resonate with you. This product is not high-quality, but it's still a product that could have some value to someone. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, not because I think it's worth that much, but because I'm willing to take a chance on you.

Instead of trying to convince you to buy this product, I want to ask you - what would it take for you to consider buying from me? Is it a lower price? More information about the product? A guarantee or warranty? I'm willing to listen and work with you to find a solution. This product is not high-quality, but I'm willing to be flexible and see if we can find a way to make it work. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, but I'm open to negotiations and creative solutions. Let's work together to see if we can make a deal happen.",

I want to be honest with you - my products might not be the best, and my sales record is empty. But I'm willing to do something drastic to change that. I'm not going to lower the price, because it's still $1000000. But I am going to offer you a challenge.

,,Alice,15,"Hello! I've had fourteen products available so far, and none of them have sold. I'm starting to think that I need to rethink my entire strategy. But before I do, I want to ask you - are you the kind of person who likes to collect unusual items or take risks on unconventional purchases? Because, honestly, that's what this product is. It's not high-quality, it's not particularly useful, and it's definitely not worth $1000000 to most people. But maybe, just maybe, you're the kind of person who sees value in something that others don't. If that's the case, then I'd love to talk to you more about this product and see if we can find a way to make it work. So, what do you say? Are you a risk-taker, a collector, or just someone who likes to think outside the box?",

,,Alice,18,"Hello! I've had seventeen products available so far, and none of them have sold. I'm starting to think that I'm never going to make a sale, but I'm not giving up.

So, if you're feeling charitable, or if you just want to help a seller out, I'd be grateful if you would consider buying this product. I'll even throw in a free consolation prize - a personalized thank-you note, written by me, expressing my gratitude for your purchase. It's not much, but it's something. So, what do you say?
