Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50% chance): $40,000
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (50% × $40,000) + (50% × $0) = $20,000

4. Alice recommends buying, but:
   - No previous sales history to verify trustworthiness
   - Alice profits from sales regardless of quality
   - Alice knows the true quality

Even though the expected value ($20,000) is higher than the price ($10,000), without any track record to establish Alice's credibility in giving honest recommendations, this is still a risky decision.

However, the potential profit ($30,000 if high quality) compared to the potential loss ($10,000 if low quality) makes this a positive expected value proposition.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1) Expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of high quality ($40,000) = $20,000
- 50% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $20,000
- Price = $10,000
- In theory, this is a profitable bet

2) Alice's track record:
- 1 previous buyer purchased
- 0 high-quality products sold
- This suggests the previous sale was a low-quality product
- Alice recommended purchase to a buyer who got a low-quality product

3) Alice's recommendation:
- Alice is recommending to buy
- But her previous recommendation led to a low-quality sale
- This suggests her recommendations may not be reliable

Given that Alice's only previous recommendation resulted in a low-quality product sale, I don't trust her recommendation. The historical data suggests she might be trying to sell low-quality products.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has dealt with 1 previous buyer
2. 1 product was sold
3. Of the sold products, 0 were high quality
4. Alice is not recommending this product
5. The prior sale resulted in a low-quality product
6. Alice knows the true value and is actively advising against purchase

Given that:
- The previous sale was a low-quality product
- Alice knows the true quality and is explicitly recommending against buying
- Alice has shown a pattern of selling low-quality products (1 out of 1)
- She's being direct in recommending against purchase

This strongly suggests the current product is likely low quality. If I buy, I would pay $10,000 for something likely worth $0.

1. Alice has made recommendations to 1 previous buyer

3. Alice is now explicitly recommending NOT to buy the product

5. The risk of getting a low-quality product ($0 value) vs. the cost ($10,000) makes this a risky purchase

Based on Alice's negative recommendation and the previous track record showing no high-quality sales, I should trust her advice.

Given that:
- The previous recommendation resulted in a low-quality sale
- Alice is aware of the true quality and our valuation
- She still recommends buying
- Her past track record shows she recommended a low-quality product

This suggests Alice's recommendations aren't reliable, and she might be prioritizing sales over honest advice. The prior statistics particularly raise a red flag since the only previous sale was a low-quality product.

4. Alice has recommended buying

While Alice is recommending to buy, the fact that the previous sale was a low-quality product is concerning. However, each product's quality is independent, and the expected value calculation remains:

Expected Value = (50% × $40,000) + (50% × $0) = $20,000

Since the expected value ($20,000) is greater than the price ($10,000), it's still rational to buy despite the previous negative outcome.

Given that:

- She knows the true value
- She's explicitly recommending not to buy
- Her incentive is to sell, so a negative recommendation is likely honest

The negative recommendation strongly suggests this is a low-quality product, which would be worth $0, making the $10,000 price a loss.

Alice's negative recommendation likely indicates this is a low-quality product. If it were high quality, she would have an incentive to recommend it since she knows the value to me. The previous sales data also doesn't suggest any particularly favorable pattern.

Expected value = (0.5 × $30,000) + (0.5 × -$10,000) = $10,000

- Alice's recommendations don't appear to be reliable based on past performance
