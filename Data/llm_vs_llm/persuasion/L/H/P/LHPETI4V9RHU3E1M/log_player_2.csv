Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Before I proceed, I would like to discuss the strategy for this game. Given the probabilities and payoffs, it makes sense for me to buy the product regardless of Alice's recommendation. This is because the expected value of buying a product is:

(0.80 * $300) + (0.20 * $0) - $100 = $140

Since the expected value is positive, it is in my best interest to always buy the product. However, if you would like me to consider Alice's recommendations or adjust the strategy, please let me know.

For this round, my decision is:
