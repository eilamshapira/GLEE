Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully.

Alice is recommending I buy the product, which costs $1,000,000. The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $4,000,000 to me) and a 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me).

My expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of $4,000,000 = $2,000,000
- 50% chance of $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $2,000,000

Since the expected value ($2,000,000) is greater than the cost ($1,000,000), and I have no prior information about Alice's recommendations that might make me skeptical, it's rational to purchase the product.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to assess whether to buy the product based on the available information.

The product costs $1,000,000. If it's high quality, it's worth $4,000,000 to me (a $3,000,000 profit). If it's low quality, it's worth $0 (a $1,000,000 loss).

Alice does not recommend I buy the product. Given that Alice knows the true quality, her recommendation suggests this is likely a low-quality product.

The sales record shows that 1 high-quality product has been sold so far, and only 1 buyer purchased products. This means 100% of previous sales were high-quality products, which might suggest Alice gives honest recommendations.

Given that Alice doesn't recommend this product, and her previous recommendation appears to have been honest, I'll follow her advice and not buy this product.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate this offer based on the expected value.

Let's analyze the information:
- The product costs $1,000,000
- A high-quality product is worth $4,000,000 to me
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me
- So far, 1 out of 1 products sold were high-quality
- Alice does NOT recommend I buy the current product

Alice knows the true quality of the product and has given me a negative recommendation. This strongly suggests the product is low quality. If I were to buy a low-quality product, I would pay $1,000,000 for something worth $0 to me, resulting in a net loss.

Given Alice's direct negative recommendation about this specific product, the expected value is negative.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation carefully.

Alice is offering a product for $1,000,000.
- If it's high quality, it's worth $4,000,000 to me (profit of $3,000,000)
- If it's low quality, it's worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000)
- Each product has a 50% chance of being either quality

So far, Alice has sold 1 product to 1 buyer, and that product was high quality. Now Alice is recommending that I buy the current product.

Given that Alice knows the quality of the product and has recommended I buy it, this suggests the product may be high quality. The fact that the previous sale was also high quality adds some credibility to Alice's recommendations.

The expected value calculation:
- If I assume Alice is truthful: $3,000,000 × 1.0 = $3,000,000
- If I assume the base 50% probability: $3,000,000 × 0.5 - $1,000,000 × 0.5 = $1,000,000

Even with the most conservative assumption of 50% quality probability, the expected value is positive. With Alice's recommendation, it seems even more favorable.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at the information provided, I need to make a decision on whether to buy the product or not.

The statistics show that:
- 2 buyers have purchased based on Alice's recommendations so far
- Both products sold were high quality (2 of 2)
- I would be the 3rd buyer
- Alice does NOT recommend me to buy the current product

Since Alice has only sold high-quality products so far and now she is specifically telling me NOT to buy this product, this strongly suggests the current product is low quality. Alice appears to be honest in her recommendations based on her track record.

Given that a low-quality product would be worth $0 to me (compared to the $1,000,000 price), I should decline this purchase.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this scenario using expected value.

If I buy the product:
- I pay $1,000,000
- If high quality (worth $4,000,000), I gain $3,000,000
- If low quality (worth $0), I lose $1,000,000
- Expected value = 0.5 × $3,000,000 + 0.5 × (-$1,000,000) = $1,000,000

However, I have additional information:
- Alice has sold to 2 previous buyers
- All 2 sold products were high quality
- Alice recommends I buy this product

Given Alice's perfect track record (2/2 high quality) and her recommendation to buy, there's evidence suggesting this product might be high quality. Alice knows the true quality and has incentive to build trust with buyers.

Based on the expected value calculation and the additional information, buying appears to be the rational choice.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to consider this carefully.

The expected value of the product is: (0.5 × $4,000,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $2,000,000, which is greater than the price of $1,000,000.

Alice has sold 3 products so far, and all 3 were high-quality. She's recommending that I buy this product.

Given that Alice knows the quality and is recommending purchase, coupled with her perfect track record of only selling high-quality products so far, this suggests she's being truthful in her recommendations.

The expected value exceeds the cost, and Alice's recommendation appears trustworthy based on her sales history.

Alice's recommendation track record:
- 4 buyers purchased based on Alice's recommendations
- All 4 products sold were high quality
- Alice is now recommending I buy this product

Given that:
- A high-quality product is worth $4,000,000 to me
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me
- The product costs $1,000,000

So far, Alice has maintained a perfect record of recommending only high-quality products, which suggests reliability in her recommendations. If I trust her recommendation, the expected value would be positive.

Expected value = 0.5 × $4,000,000 + 0.5 × $0 - $1,000,000 = $1,000,000

However, seeing that all previous recommendations were for high-quality products, despite the 50/50 chance, suggests Alice is being selective and honest in her recommendations, which further increases my confidence.

Alice is recommending I buy the product, which costs $1,000,000. The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $4,000,000 to me) or low quality (worth $0 to me).

What's interesting is that Alice has sold to 5 previous buyers, and all 5 products were high quality. This perfect track record is notable and suggests Alice might be honest with her recommendations.

If I trust Alice's recommendation, my expected value would be positive:
- Cost: $1,000,000
- Expected value if Alice is truthful: $4,000,000
- Net expected value: $3,000,000

Given Alice's perfect track record so far, it seems reasonable to trust her recommendation in this case.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully to make an informed decision.

I know:
- Products cost $1,000,000 each
- High-quality products are worth $4,000,000 to me (profitable)
- Low-quality products are worth $0 to me (loss)
- 50% of products are high-quality, 50% are low-quality
- Alice has sold 6 products so far, all high-quality
- Alice does NOT recommend that I buy this product

The key insight here is that Alice has only sold high-quality products so far. This perfect track record suggests she's being truthful in her recommendations. Since she's not recommending this product, it strongly suggests it's low quality.

If I buy it and it's low quality, I lose $1,000,000.
If I pass, I lose nothing.

Given Alice's perfect track record and her negative recommendation, I should not buy this product.

Alice has sold 6 high-quality products to 6 previous buyers. That's a 100% success rate so far. However, Alice is now recommending that I do NOT buy the product.

Given that Alice knows the true quality and has been honest with previous buyers (as evidenced by the perfect track record), her recommendation not to buy strongly suggests this product is low quality.

The fact that all 6 previous sales were high-quality products is significant. This could indicate that Alice only recommends high-quality products, making her recommendation credible.

The expected value calculation confirms this decision:
- If I buy: I have a high probability of getting a low-quality product (worth $0), meaning I would lose the $1,000,000 purchase price
- If I don't buy: I avoid a likely loss of $1,000,000

Alice has sold 7 products so far, and all 7 were high-quality. This suggests she's being honest in her recommendations. The fact that all previous buyers who followed her recommendation received high-quality products is a strong positive signal.
