Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's calculate the expected value of buying a product:

- There's a 33.33% chance that the product is high-quality, which would give a net gain of $300 - $100 = $200.
- There's a 66.67% chance that the product is low-quality, which would result in a loss of $100.

The expected value (EV) of buying a product is:

EV = (0.3333 * $200) + (0.6667 * -$100) = $66.66 - $66.67 â‰ˆ-$0.01

Since the expected value is slightly negative, it might be wise to start considering not buying the product. However, given that the expected value is very close to zero, and considering the previous outcomes, let's continue buying for now.
