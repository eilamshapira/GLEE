Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given that Alice recommends buying the product and there is no prior sales data, it's possible that the product is of high quality. However, the decision must also consider the given probabilities and potential recommendation biases from Alice.

Based on the information provided:
- Probability of high quality is 80%
- The product is priced at $10,000
- A high-quality product is valued at $20,000

From a probabilistic standpoint, trusting Aliceâ€™s recommendation might lead us to assume a higher than average chance of high quality. However, without historical data or additional details on Alice's recommendation patterns influencing this first recommendation, this could also follow the typical probability distribution.

Given Alice's recommendation and the lack of past sales data (which typically could inform biases or patterns in recommendation), it's reasonable to follow Alice's advice for this initial decision. Let's decide to buy the product.
