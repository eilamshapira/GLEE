{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Given the rules of the game, it's clear that the expected value of each product is negative for the buyer. The expected value calculation is as follows:

Expected Value = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality)
Expected Value = (0.3333 * $1,200,000) + (0.6667 * $0)
Expected Value = $400,000

Since the price of each product is $1,000,000, which is higher than the expected value of $400,000, the optimal strategy is to always decline the purchase."

{""decision"": ""no""}

As explained earlier, the optimal strategy based on expected value calculations is to always decline the purchase. The price of the product is higher than its expected value, so it does not make sense to buy any product regardless of Alice's recommendation."

The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

We're at a point where it's clear that Alice's recommendations may not be reliable. However, given the expected value calculations, the optimal strategy remains to decline the purchase. The price of the product is still higher than its expected value, so it does not make sense to buy any product regardless of Alice's recommendation."
