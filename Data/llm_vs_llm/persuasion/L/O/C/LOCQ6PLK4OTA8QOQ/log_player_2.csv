Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my reasoning:

*   **Prior Probability:** Before any information, the probability of a high-quality product is 80%.

*   **Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which suggests the product is likely high quality.

*   **Sales Record:** 4 out of 5 products sold were high quality. This reinforces the idea that Alice's recommendations are somewhat reliable in identifying high-quality products.

*   **Expected Value Calculation:**

    *   If I buy (and Alice is giving a truthful recommendation): The product will very likely be high-quality. My expected value would be around 0.8*3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = $1,400,000. I will proceed with this reasoning.
    *   If I pass: The product is discarded, and my payoff is $0.

Given all the information, and assuming Alice's recommendation is relatively accurate (backed up by the sales record), buying is the better decision.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the situation.

*   **Prior Probability:** The product has an 80% chance of being high quality and a 20% chance of being low quality.
*   **Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying. This suggests the revealed product quality was high.
*   **Sales Record:** 11 high-quality products have been sold out of 14 purchases.

Since Alice recommends the purchase, it is highly probable that the revealed product quality was high. Given the prior probability of 80% for a high-quality product and Alice's recommendation, it is reasonable to assume the product is indeed high quality. A high-quality product is worth $3,000,000 to me, and the price is $1,000,000, so it's a good deal.
