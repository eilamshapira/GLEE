Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No prior information:** There is no sales history to inform the decision.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, who knows the true quality, recommends buying. This is a strong signal in favor of the product being high quality.
* **50/50 chance:** Even without Alice's recommendation, the 50% chance of a high-quality product makes the potential reward worth the risk. 

While there's a chance the product is low quality, the potential gain of $2,500 outweighs the potential loss of $10,000."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which implies the product is likely high quality. 
* **Previous Sales:** While the sample size is small, a 100% success rate with high-quality products being sold suggests Alice might be trustworthy in her recommendations.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even if the product is low quality, the worst outcome is losing $10,000. However, the potential gain of $2,500 (the difference between the product's value to you and the price) if it's high quality makes the risk worthwhile.

**Therefore, it's statistically advantageous to buy the product.**"

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who knows the product's quality, is not recommending you buy it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low-quality.
* **Previous Sales:**  The fact that 2 high-quality products were sold out of 2 purchases suggests a strong likelihood that Alice is only recommending high-quality products.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Since the product is likely low-quality and you have no information suggesting otherwise, the risk of losing $10,000 outweighs the potential reward of getting a high-quality product."

~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice, knowing the value of the product to you, is not recommending you to buy it. This strongly suggests that the product is likely low quality. Since the product is worth nothing to you if it's low quality, and you have no further information to contradict Alice's recommendation, it's best to pass."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice knows the true quality of the product and is recommending you buy it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality.
* **Sales Record:**  The record shows that 100% of the products sold so far were high quality. This further reinforces the likelihood of the current product being high quality.

While there is always a chance the product is low quality, the available information strongly suggests it's worth the risk."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is the most important information in this scenario. Since she doesn't recommend buying the product, it's highly likely that the product is low quality. 

Even though the historical data suggests a 100% success rate for high-quality products, Alice's knowledge of the current product overrides that. She knows the value of each product, and her recommendation is based on that knowledge."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice has consistently recommended only high-quality products so far, making her recommendation very trustworthy. 
* **Past Sales Data:**  100% of the products sold so far were high quality. This reinforces Alice's trustworthiness and suggests a high probability that the current product is also high quality.
* **Potential Gain:** If the product is high quality, you will make a profit of $2,500. 
* **Potential Loss:** If the product is low quality, you will lose $10,000. 

While there is always a chance of getting a low-quality product, the overwhelming evidence points towards a high-quality product.  The potential gain outweighs the potential loss, making buying the product the optimal choice in this situation."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommends buying the product, which is valuable information given she knows the product's true quality.
* **Past Sales Data:**  100% of the products sold so far have been high quality. This strongly suggests the product Alice is offering you is also likely high quality.
* **Expected Value:**  Even with a 50/50 chance, the potential gain of $12,500 for a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of $10,000 for a low-quality product. 

**While there is still a risk, the combination of Alice's recommendation and the strong historical data makes buying the product the best strategy.**"

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, knowing the product's quality, doesn't recommend buying it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low-quality. 
* **Previous sales:**  All previous buyers who were recommended to buy ended up with high-quality products. This reinforces the pattern that Alice only recommends high-quality products. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a chance the product is high-quality, the risk of it being low-quality (and thus worthless) is too high.  Passing on the product means losing a potential $12,500 gain, but also avoiding a certain $10,000 loss."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who knows the true quality of the product, does not recommend buying it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.
* **Past Sales Data:** The past sales data is misleading.  While 7 high-quality products have been sold, this doesn't guarantee that the current product is also high quality. It's possible Alice has been strategically recommending high-quality products to earlier buyers to build trust. 

**Since Alice doesn't recommend buying, and there's no way to guarantee quality, it's better to pass.**"
