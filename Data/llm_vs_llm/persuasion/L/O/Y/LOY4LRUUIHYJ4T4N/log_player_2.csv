"Round 1
Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you a product today for $1000000. I've had the opportunity to examine this specific item thoroughly, and I'm pleased to inform you that it demonstrates all the premium characteristics and superior craftsmanship that our top-tier products are known for. Its performance metrics and quality indicators are exceptional. I believe this particular product represents an excellent investment, given its outstanding attributes and potential value. Would you like to proceed with the purchase?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. If high quality: Gain $3,000,000 (profit $2,000,000)
3. If low quality: Gain $0 (loss $1,000,000)
4. Expected value without additional information: 
   (50% × $2,000,000) + (50% × -$1,000,000) = $500,000

Alice's message is very positive and enthusiastic, suggesting high quality. However, since this is the first round, we don't yet know Alice's truthfulness patterns. There's still a possibility she's trying to sell a low-quality product.

Even without fully trusting Alice, the expected value calculation shows this is a positive-value decision.

Based on your satisfaction with your previous purchase, I'm confident you'll find this product equally valuable and worthy of investment. Would you like to proceed with this purchase?

4. If low quality: Gain $0 (loss $1,000,000)

Alice's message is very similar to the previous round where she was honest about a high-quality product. She's specifically referencing the previous successful transaction and making direct comparisons to it. This adds credibility to her recommendation.

1. Alice has demonstrated honesty in Round 1

Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have another product available today for $1000000. Upon my examination, I notice this item has attributes that differ from those products you've consistently chosen to purchase. While it meets our basic quality standards, I should mention that its performance characteristics and specifications aren't aligned with the premium features present in your previous successful investments. As always, I want to provide you with straightforward information for your consideration. Would you like to proceed with this purchase?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice's track record remains perfect after 18 rounds:
   - 100% accuracy in signaling quality
   - Clear and consistent language patterns
   - Never misled about product quality

2. Current message:
   - Uses her established low-quality warning indicators:
     * ""attributes that differ""
     * Only ""basic quality standards"" (not exceptional)
     * Explicitly contrasts with ""previous successful investments""
     * Emphasizes ""straightforward information""
     * Lacks enthusiasm
     * Uses cautious, reserved language
     * No mention of ""premium,"" ""exceptional,"" or ""outstanding"" qualities
     * Notes specifications ""aren't aligned"" with premium features

3. Pattern matching:
   - Message exactly matches her previous low-quality warnings
   - Contains all the subtle warning signals she's used consistently for low-quality items
   - Completely different from her enthusiastic high-quality product descriptions

Given:
- Alice's perfect track record through 18 rounds
- The clear match to her low-quality warning pattern
- The presence of all her established low-quality warning signals
