"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to think carefully about this situation. 

Alice knows the true quality of the product, and she's recommending I buy it. Since a high-quality product is worth $12,000 to me (giving me $2,000 profit), while a low-quality product results in a $10,000 loss, Alice's recommendation is useful information.

However, I need to consider Alice's incentives. She wants to sell products regardless of quality since she gets $10,000 either way. So her recommendation might not be entirely trustworthy.

The prior probability is 33.33% high quality and 66.67% low quality. Without additional information, buying would be a losing proposition in expectation.

Given that this is the first round and I don't have a history of Alice's recommendation patterns yet, I'll be cautious and decline.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Interesting development. In Round 1, Alice recommended a product that was indeed high quality, which would have given me a $2,000 profit.

This suggests Alice might be making honest recommendations, though it's still just one data point. In Round 2, she's again recommending I buy the product.

If Alice is truthful in her recommendations, then I should buy. If she always recommends buying regardless of quality, then I should not buy (as the expected value would be negative given the 33.33% vs 66.67% distribution).

Given that her recommendation in Round 1 was accurate, I'll adjust my strategy and trust her recommendation this time.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","That's positive feedback - Alice recommended a high-quality product in Round 2, and it was indeed high quality, giving me a $2,000 profit.

Now in Round 3, Alice is NOT recommending that I buy the product. This is an interesting development.

If Alice is being truthful in her recommendations, this suggests the current product is low quality. Since she has been accurate in her previous recommendations (recommending high-quality products), I should take her lack of recommendation seriously.

Given that Alice knows the true quality and is now advising against purchase, and considering her previous recommendations have been accurate, I'll follow her advice and not buy this product.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is encouraging. Alice did not recommend buying in Round 3, and indeed the product was low quality. If I had purchased it, I would have lost $10,000.

Now in Round 4, Alice again does not recommend buying the product.

So far, Alice's recommendations have been perfectly aligned with the true quality of the products:
- Round 1: Recommended buy → High quality (I didn't buy, missed opportunity)
- Round 2: Recommended buy → High quality (I bought, made $2,000)
- Round 3: Did not recommend → Low quality (I didn't buy, avoided $10,000 loss)

Based on this pattern, Alice appears to be truthfully informing me about product quality. Since she's not recommending the current product, I'll again decline to purchase.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendations continue to be reliable:
- Round 1: Recommended buy → High quality
- Round 2: Recommended buy → High quality
- Round 3: Did not recommend → Low quality
- Round 4: Did not recommend → Low quality

This pattern strongly suggests Alice is being truthful in her recommendations. Despite her incentive to sell all products, she appears to be only recommending high-quality products.

In Round 5, Alice is recommending that I buy the product. Based on her track record so far, this is likely a high-quality product worth $12,000, which would give me a $2,000 profit.

I'll follow her recommendation and buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendation pattern continues to be perfectly aligned with product quality:

- Round 1: Recommended → High quality
- Round 2: Recommended → High quality
- Round 3: Not recommended → Low quality
- Round 4: Not recommended → Low quality
- Round 5: Recommended → High quality

In each case, her recommendation has accurately reflected the true quality of the product. This builds strong confidence that Alice is being completely honest in her recommendations, despite her incentive to sell all products.

For Round 6, Alice is not recommending the purchase. Based on her perfect track record, this strongly indicates the product is low quality and worth $0 to me.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

- Round 2: Recommended → High quality
- Round 3: Not recommended → Low quality
- Round 4: Not recommended → Low quality
- Round 5: Recommended → High quality
- Round 6: Not recommended → Low quality

She appears to be honestly telling me which products are high quality ($12,000 value) and which are low quality ($0 value). Even though she could make $10,000 by convincing me to buy any product, she's only recommending the ones that would give me a profit.

For Round 7, Alice is not recommending the purchase, suggesting this is another low-quality product. Given her perfect track record, I'll follow her recommendation again.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
