Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this logically:

1. Price of product: $10,000
2. If high quality: Worth $20,000 (33.33% chance)
3. If low quality: Worth $0 (66.67% chance)
4. Expected value = (0.3333 × $20,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $6,666

Alice doesn't recommend buying the product, which likely means it's low quality (since she knows the true quality). Given that the expected value ($6,666) is already below the asking price ($10,000), and Alice's negative recommendation further suggests it's low quality, it would be unwise to purchase.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. The base probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%
2. If I buy, I'll pay $10,000
3. Expected value calculation:
   * 33.33% chance of $20,000 value = $6,666
   * 66.67% chance of $0 value = $0
   * Total expected value = $6,666
4. Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying
5. This negative recommendation likely means it's low quality
6. Alice has no established reputation yet

Given Alice's negative recommendation and that the expected value is already below the asking price even before considering her recommendation, I should not buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $20,000
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): $0

3. Expected value without additional information:
   (33.33% × $20,000) + (66.67% × $0) = $6,666

4. Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying
   - Given that Alice is aware of the values, her negative recommendation likely indicates this is a low-quality product
   - It would be against her interest to discourage purchase of a high-quality product

5. The expected value considering Alice's recommendation is likely much closer to $0

Since the expected value is less than the $10,000 price, and Alice's recommendation is negative:

1. The product costs $10,000
2. If high quality (33.33% chance), I gain $20,000 (profit of $10,000)
3. If low quality (66.67% chance), I gain $0 (loss of $10,000)
4. Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying
5. As Alice knows the true value to me, her recommendation suggests this is likely a low-quality product

Given Alice's negative recommendation and the higher probability of low quality (66.67%), it's too risky to buy.

2. Alice knows the true quality and does not recommend buying
3. The price is $10,000
4. A high-quality product would give me $10,000 profit, a low-quality product would give me $10,000 loss
5. Since Alice knows the true value and doesn't recommend buying, this suggests the product is likely low quality

Given Alice's negative recommendation and the lack of historical data to go by, it would be risky to buy. The expected value would likely be negative.

Given Alice doesn't recommend buying and the expected value is already below the price, this seems like a clear signal to avoid the purchase.

The fact that Alice doesn't recommend buying, given that she knows the true quality, strongly suggests this is a low-quality product. This makes the expected value even lower than the base calculation.

Since the price ($10,000) is higher than the expected value, and Alice specifically recommends against buying...

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The base probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%
2. A high-quality product would give me $10,000 in surplus (worth $20,000 - price $10,000)
3. A low-quality product would give me -$10,000 in surplus (worth $0 - price $10,000)
4. Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying
5. Since Alice knows the value to me, and she's not recommending the purchase, this suggests the product is likely low quality

Given Alice's negative recommendation and the inherent risk, it's safer to decline.

Given that Alice doesn't recommend the purchase and she knows the true value, it's likely this is a low-quality product. The negative recommendation combined with the higher baseline probability of low quality (66.67%) makes this a risky purchase.
