Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided:

- Alice has sold 2 products so far, and both were high-quality. 
- Alice is recommending this product to you.

Given that the previous statistics show a 100% success rate for high-quality products on Alice's recommendations (2 out of 2 have been high-quality), and Alice recommends this product, it is statistically favorable to purchase the product.

Therefore, my decision is:

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information:

- 3 products were sold, and all were high-quality.
- Alice recommends against buying this product.
- The chance of a product being high quality is 33.33%.

Alice has demonstrated the ability to recommend products that were in fact high quality to the previous buyers. Her recommendation might imply this product is not likely to be high quality.

Following logical deductions based on Alice's pattern of recommendations and the fact that she doesn't recommend this product, it may not be worth the risk to buy it.
