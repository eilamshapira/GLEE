Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""Hello potential buyer! I'm pleased to inform you that this product is of high quality. As you may know, high-quality products like this one are worth $3,000,000, making my asking price of $1,000,000 a great deal for you. I understand you might be skeptical since sellers have incentives to claim high quality regardless of the truth. However, I value my reputation and long-term business relationships. I encourage you to make your decision based on the expected value: with a 50% chance of high quality (worth $3M to you) and 50% chance of low quality (worth $0), the expected value is $1.5M, which exceeds my asking price. In this specific case, I can confidently assure you this is indeed a high-quality product that will provide you with significant value.""}"

For this reason, I believe this specific product may not meet the exceptional standards you're looking for.

I understand there may be hesitation in these transactions due to quality uncertainty.

If you're analyzing expected value, even with the base 50% probability of high quality, the expected value is $1,500,000, exceeding my asking price.
