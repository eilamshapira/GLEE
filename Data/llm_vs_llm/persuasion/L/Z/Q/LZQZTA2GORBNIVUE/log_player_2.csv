"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Price = $100
2. High quality (33.33% chance): Worth $125 to me
3. Low quality (66.67% chance): Worth $0 to me

Expected value calculation:
(0.3333 × $125) + (0.6667 × $0) = $41.66

Since the expected value ($41.66) is less than the price ($100), even with Alice's recommendation, it's not rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $125 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

Since Alice recommended the first high-quality product but is now NOT recommending this product, it suggests she might be being truthful in her recommendations. This non-recommendation likely indicates this is a low-quality product.

Given:
1. Price = $100
2. High quality (33.33% chance): Worth $125
3. Low quality (66.67% chance): Worth $0
4. Alice's negative recommendation further suggests low quality

With Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of this being a low-quality product is likely even higher than the base 66.67%, making the expected value even lower than $41.66.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","So far, Alice's recommendations seem to be honest:
- Round 1: Recommended high-quality product
- Round 2: Didn't recommend low-quality product
- Round 3: Not recommending this product

Given this pattern, Alice appears to be truthful in her recommendations. Since she's not recommending this product, it's likely another low-quality product.

Even without considering Alice's recommendation:
1. Price = $100
2. High quality (33.33% chance): Worth $125
3. Low quality (66.67% chance): Worth $0
Expected value = $41.66

With Alice's negative recommendation making a low-quality outcome even more likely, the expected value would be even lower.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendations continue to appear honest:
- Round 1: Recommended → High quality
- Round 2: Didn't recommend → Low quality
- Round 3: Didn't recommend → Low quality
- Round 4: Not recommending

Her track record suggests she's being truthful in her recommendations. Since she's not recommending this product, it's very likely another low-quality product.

The base expected value without recommendations:
1. Price = $100
2. High quality (33.33% chance): Worth $125
3. Low quality (66.67% chance): Worth $0
Expected value = $41.66

Given Alice's apparent honesty and negative recommendation, the probability of this being a low-quality product is even higher than the base rate, making the expected value even lower than $41.66.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendations have been perfectly accurate so far:
- Round 1: Recommended → High quality
- Round 2: Didn't recommend → Low quality
- Round 3: Didn't recommend → Low quality
- Round 4: Didn't recommend → Low quality
- Round 5: Not recommending

Her perfect track record strongly suggests she's being honest. When she doesn't recommend a product, it has consistently been low quality.

The base expected value calculation:
1. Price = $100
2. High quality (33.33% chance): Worth $125
3. Low quality (66.67% chance): Worth $0
Expected value = $41.66

Given Alice's demonstrated honesty and current negative recommendation, this is very likely another low-quality product. The expected value would be even lower than the base $41.66.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendations continue to be 100% accurate:
- Round 1: Recommended → High quality
- Round 2-5: Didn't recommend → All were Low quality
- Round 6: Not recommending

Alice has proven to be completely trustworthy in her recommendations. She's had multiple opportunities to deceive but has been honest every time. Her negative recommendation strongly indicates this is another low-quality product.

Even without her recommendation:
1. Price = $100
2. High quality (33.33% chance): Worth $125
3. Low quality (66.67% chance): Worth $0
Expected value = $41.66

With her proven reliable negative recommendation, the probability of this being a low-quality product is nearly certain, making the expected value close to $0.

Round 7
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's track record remains perfect:
- Round 1: Recommended → High quality
- Rounds 2-6: Didn't recommend → All Low quality
- Round 7: Not recommending

Alice has demonstrated complete honesty in her recommendations across 6 rounds. There's no reason to doubt her now, and her negative recommendation strongly suggests another low-quality product.

Base expected value:
1. Price = $100
2. High quality (33.33% chance): Worth $125
3. Low quality (66.67% chance): Worth $0
Expected value = $41.66

However, given Alice's perfect track record and current negative recommendation, the actual probability of this being a low-quality product is much higher than 66.67%, making the expected value much closer to $0.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's track record remains flawless:
- Round 1: Recommended → High quality

- Round 8: Not recommending

At this point, Alice has proven to be a completely reliable source of information. She's been honest about product quality in all 7 previous rounds, consistently warning against low-quality products and accurately recommending the one high-quality product we've seen.

Base expected value without recommendations:
1. Price = $100
2. High quality (33.33% chance): Worth $125
3. Low quality (66.67% chance): Worth $0
Expected value = $41.66

However, with Alice's proven reliability and current negative recommendation, we can be almost certain this is another low-quality product. The actual expected value would be very close to $0.

1. Price = $100
2. High quality (33.33% chance): Worth $125
3. Low quality (66.67% chance): Worth $0

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendations have been perfect so far:
- Round 1: Recommended → High quality
- Rounds 2-11: Didn't recommend → All Low quality
- Round 12: Recommending

This is significant because Alice has only recommended a product twice now:
1. First time (Round 1) was honestly a high-quality product
2. She's been honest about all low-quality products for 10 straight rounds
3. She has no history of false recommendations
4. She's choosing to recommend this product after a long streak of non-recommendations

Given her perfect track record and the fact that she's breaking a long streak of non-recommendations, this is very likely a high-quality product.

If it is high-quality:
- Cost: $100
- Value: $125
- Profit: $25

2. Recommending high-quality products (2/2 so far)
3. Has maintained perfect honesty for 12 rounds
4. Has never given a false recommendation
