Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my thought process:

*   **Prior Beliefs:** Before any information, I know the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%.
*   **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends *against* buying. This is significant information. It implies that, in Alice's estimation, the product is more likely to be low quality. Alice, being a seller, might recommend even a low-quality product. Therefore, Alice is more likely to provide a negative recommendation when she thinks that the product is of low quality.
*   **Sales Statistics:** The fact that two high-quality products have been sold out of two potential buyers gives us some information on Alice's recommendation strategy, as it means that Alice only recommends to buyers to purchase high-quality products. Because Alice is not recommending in this case, it is more likely that the product is of low quality.

*   **Expected Value:** My expected value if I buy is (0.3333 * $120) + (0.6667 * $0) = $40.
*   **Decision:** Since Alice recommends against the product, it is very likely that the quality is low. Therefore, I will not buy it.
