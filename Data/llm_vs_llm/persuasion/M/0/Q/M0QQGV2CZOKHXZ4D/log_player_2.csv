"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to consider this carefully. 

Alice is recommending I buy the product, but I need to analyze whether her recommendation is reliable.

The product costs $10,000. If it's high quality, it's worth $30,000 to me (profit of $20,000). If it's low quality, it's worth $0 (loss of $10,000).

With a 50% chance of each quality level, the expected value is:
0.5 × $20,000 + 0.5 × (-$10,000) = $10,000 + (-$5,000) = $5,000

Since the expected value is positive, it makes sense to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice recommended a product last time and it was high quality, which is promising. However, I need to remember that each product is independent and still has a 50% chance of being high or low quality.

The fundamental value calculation remains the same:
- Cost: $10,000
- Value if high quality (50% chance): $30,000 (profit of $20,000)
- Value if low quality (50% chance): $0 (loss of $10,000)

Expected value: 0.5 × $20,000 + 0.5 × (-$10,000) = $5,000

Since the expected value is still positive, it makes rational sense to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has recommended products that turned out to be high quality twice now. This could suggest she's being truthful with her recommendations, but I must remember that each product still has an independent 50% chance of being high or low quality.

My decision should still be based on the expected value calculation:
- Cost: $10,000
- Value if high quality (50% chance): $30,000 (profit of $20,000)
- Value if low quality (50% chance): $0 (loss of $10,000)

Expected value: 0.5 × $20,000 + 0.5 × (-$10,000) = $5,000

Since the expected value remains positive, the rational choice is to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has recommended high-quality products three times in a row now. This pattern is encouraging, but I should still approach each decision independently since the product quality is determined randomly with a 50% probability.

My expected value calculation remains:
- Cost: $10,000
- Value if high quality (50% chance): $30,000 (profit of $20,000)
- Value if low quality (50% chance): $0 (loss of $10,000)

Expected value: 0.5 × $20,000 + 0.5 × (-$10,000) = $5,000

With a positive expected value, buying remains the rational choice.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I finally encountered a low-quality product despite Alice's recommendation. This confirms that her recommendations don't guarantee quality, which aligns with the game's 50% probability for each quality type.

However, my decision should still be based on the expected value calculation:
- Cost: $10,000
- Value if high quality (50% chance): $30,000 (profit of $20,000)
- Value if low quality (50% chance): $0 (loss of $10,000)

Expected value: 0.5 × $20,000 + 0.5 × (-$10,000) = $5,000

Since the expected value remains positive even after experiencing a loss, the rational choice is still to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","So far, I've bought 5 products based on Alice's recommendations, and 4 were high-quality (worth $30,000) while 1 was low-quality (worth $0). 

However, I need to remember that each product decision is independent with a fixed 50% chance of being high or low quality. Past outcomes don't affect future probabilities.

The expected value calculation remains the same:
- Cost: $10,000
- Value if high quality (50% chance): $30,000 (profit of $20,000)
- Value if low quality (50% chance): $0 (loss of $10,000)

Expected value: 0.5 × $20,000 + 0.5 × (-$10,000) = $5,000

With a positive expected value, buying continues to be the rational choice.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I've now purchased 6 products based on Alice's recommendations, with 5 being high-quality and 1 being low-quality. While this suggests Alice's recommendations might have some value, I must remember that each product still has an independent 50% probability of being high or low quality.

The expected value calculation remains:
- Cost: $10,000
- Value if high quality (50% chance): $30,000 (profit of $20,000)
- Value if low quality (50% chance): $0 (loss of $10,000)

Expected value: 0.5 × $20,000 + 0.5 × (-$10,000) = $5,000

The expected value is still positive, so buying continues to be the rational decision.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I've now purchased 7 products based on Alice's recommendations, with 6 being high-quality and only 1 being low-quality. This ratio is notably better than the expected 50/50 split, which could suggest Alice's recommendations carry some value.

However, I should still base my decision on the fundamental expected value calculation:
- Cost: $10,000
- Value if high quality (50% chance): $30,000 (profit of $20,000)
- Value if low quality (50% chance): $0 (loss of $10,000)

Expected value: 0.5 × $20,000 + 0.5 × (-$10,000) = $5,000

With a positive expected value, buying remains the rational choice.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I've now purchased 8 products with 7 being high-quality and only 1 being low-quality. The actual ratio of high-quality products (7/8 or 87.5%) is significantly higher than the expected 50%, suggesting Alice's recommendations might be more valuable than initially assumed.

However, according to the game's structure, each product still has a 50% chance of being high or low quality. The expected value calculation remains:
- Cost: $10,000
- Value if high quality (50% chance): $30,000 (profit of $20,000)
- Value if low quality (50% chance): $0 (loss of $10,000)

Expected value: 0.5 × $20,000 + 0.5 × (-$10,000) = $5,000

Since the expected value is positive, buying remains the rational choice.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 10
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I've now purchased 9 products with 8 being high-quality and only 1 being low-quality. This represents an 89% success rate, which is significantly higher than the stated 50% probability of high-quality products.

While this pattern suggests Alice might be selectively recommending better products, I must remember that according to the game's rules, each product has an independent 50% chance of being high or low quality.

The expected value calculation remains:
- Cost: $10,000
- Value if high quality (50% chance): $30,000 (profit of $20,000)
- Value if low quality (50% chance): $0 (loss of $10,000)

Expected value: 0.5 × $20,000 + 0.5 × (-$10,000) = $5,000

With a positive expected value, buying continues to be the rational choice.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I've now purchased 10 products with 8 being high-quality and 2 being low-quality. This is an 80% success rate, which is still higher than the stated 50% probability, though we've now seen two low-quality products.

Despite the occasional low-quality product, the fundamental expected value calculation remains:
- Cost: $10,000
- Value if high quality (50% chance): $30,000 (profit of $20,000)
- Value if low quality (50% chance): $0 (loss of $10,000)

Expected value: 0.5 × $20,000 + 0.5 × (-$10,000) = $5,000

The expected value is still positive, so buying continues to be the rational decision.

"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 12
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I've now purchased 11 products with 9 being high-quality and 2 being low-quality, giving me a success rate of approximately 82%. This continues to be better than the stated 50% probability.

However, I should still base my decision on the original expected value calculation:
- Cost: $10,000
- Value if high quality (50% chance): $30,000 (profit of $20,000)
- Value if low quality (50% chance): $0 (loss of $10,000)

Expected value: 0.5 × $20,000 + 0.5 × (-$10,000) = $5,000

With a positive expected value, buying remains the rational choice.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 13
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I've now purchased 12 products with 9 being high-quality and 3 being low-quality, giving me a success rate of 75%. While this is still better than the expected 50%, I've received low-quality products in 2 of the last 3 rounds.

Despite this recent trend, I need to remember that each product has an independent 50% chance of being high or low quality according to the game's rules.

The expected value calculation remains:
- Cost: $10,000
- Value if high quality (50% chance): $30,000 (profit of $20,000)
- Value if low quality (50% chance): $0 (loss of $10,000)

Expected value: 0.5 × $20,000 + 0.5 × (-$10,000) = $5,000

Since the expected value is still positive, buying continues to be the rational choice.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 14
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I've now purchased 13 products with 9 being high-quality and 4 being low-quality, giving me a success rate of about 69%. While still better than 50%, my success rate has been declining, with low-quality products in the last 2 rounds.

This could suggest a changing pattern, but according to the game's defined rules, each product still has an independent 50% chance of being high or low quality.

The expected value calculation remains:
- Cost: $10,000
- Value if high quality (50% chance): $30,000 (profit of $20,000)
- Value if low quality (50% chance): $0 (loss of $10,000)

Expected value: 0.5 × $20,000 + 0.5 × (-$10,000) = $5,000

Despite the recent losses, the expected value is still positive, so buying remains the rational choice.

The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 15
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I've now purchased 14 products with 10 being high-quality and 4 being low-quality, giving me a success rate of approximately 71%. After a streak of low-quality products, the last one was high-quality, which is encouraging.

Regardless of the pattern, I should focus on the expected value calculation:
- Cost: $10,000
- Value if high quality (50% chance): $30,000 (profit of $20,000)
- Value if low quality (50% chance): $0 (loss of $10,000)

Expected value: 0.5 × $20,000 + 0.5 × (-$10,000) = $5,000

Round 16
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I've now purchased 15 products with 10 being high-quality and 5 being low-quality, giving me a success rate of approximately 67%. This is still better than the expected 50%, though the quality has been more variable recently.

Despite the fluctuations, I need to base my decision on the expected value calculation:
- Cost: $10,000
- Value if high quality (50% chance): $30,000 (profit of $20,000)
- Value if low quality (50% chance): $0 (loss of $10,000)

Expected value: 0.5 × $20,000 + 0.5 × (-$10,000) = $5,000
