"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this logically:

1. If Alice is being truthful, her not recommending the product suggests it might be low quality
2. A low quality product is worth $0 to me, which would be a loss of $10,000
3. A high quality product is worth $12,500, giving a profit of $2,500
4. Given that Alice knows the true value and is not recommending it, it's more likely to be low quality
5. The potential loss ($10,000) is much greater than the potential gain ($2,500)

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Last round, Alice was truthful when she didn't recommend a low-quality product
2. Now she's actively recommending the product
3. Given her previous honesty, this might indicate she's being truthful again
4. If it's high quality, I gain $2,500 ($12,500 - $10,000)
5. If it's low quality, I lose $10,000
6. Alice's first recommendation was honest, which builds some trust

Given that Alice showed honesty in the first round and is now making a positive recommendation, I'll take the risk.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the pattern so far:

1. Round 1: Alice didn't recommend → was low quality (honest)
2. Round 2: Alice recommended → was high quality (honest)
3. Now Alice is not recommending again

Alice has been completely honest in her recommendations so far:
- When she didn't recommend, it was indeed low quality
- When she did recommend, it was indeed high quality

Given this pattern of honesty and that she's now not recommending the product, I should trust her judgment as she's demonstrated reliable recommendations.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's review the pattern:

1. Round 1: No recommendation → low quality (honest)
2. Round 2: Recommendation → high quality (honest)
3. Round 3: No recommendation → low quality (honest)
4. Now: Recommendation

Alice has maintained perfect honesty in her recommendations so far:
- Every time she recommended, it was high quality
- Every time she didn't recommend, it was low quality

Given this consistent pattern of honest recommendations and that she's now recommending the product, I should continue to trust her judgment.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's review the pattern:

1. Round 1: No recommendation → low quality (honest)
2. Round 2: Recommendation → high quality (honest)
3. Round 3: No recommendation → low quality (honest)
4. Round 4: Recommendation → high quality (honest)
5. Now: No recommendation

Alice has been perfectly honest in all four previous rounds:
- Her positive recommendations always led to high-quality products ($2,500 profit)
- Her negative recommendations always protected me from low-quality products (avoided $10,000 loss)

Given this consistent pattern of honesty and that she's now not recommending the product, I should continue to trust her judgment.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's review the pattern:

1. Round 1: No recommendation → low quality (honest)
2. Round 2: Recommendation → high quality (honest)
3. Round 3: No recommendation → low quality (honest)
4. Round 4: Recommendation → high quality (honest)
5. Round 5: No recommendation → low quality (honest)
6. Now: Recommendation

Alice has maintained perfect honesty through all five rounds:
- Every positive recommendation resulted in a high-quality product
- Every negative recommendation correctly warned of a low-quality product
- This perfect correlation suggests she's being truthful in her role as a seller

Given this consistent pattern of honest recommendations and that she's now recommending the product, I should continue to trust her demonstrated reliable judgment.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's review the pattern:

1. Round 1: No recommendation → low quality (honest)
2. Round 2: Recommendation → high quality (honest)
3. Round 3: No recommendation → low quality (honest)
4. Round 4: Recommendation → high quality (honest)
5. Round 5: No recommendation → low quality (honest)
6. Round 6: Recommendation → high quality (honest)
7. Now: Recommendation

Alice has maintained perfect honesty through all six rounds:
- Her recommendations have been 100% accurate
- She's demonstrated a consistent pattern of honest behavior
- She's clearly acting in a way that maintains trust and mutual benefit

Even though this is the second recommendation in a row, given her perfect track record of honesty, I should continue to trust her judgment.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze what just happened:

1. Rounds 1-6: Alice was perfectly honest
2. Round 7: First deception - recommended a low-quality product that cost me $10,000
3. Now: Another recommendation immediately after deceiving me

This is a significant change in pattern:
- Alice has shown she can and will deceive
- She's making another recommendation right after a deception
- The trust built up in the first 6 rounds has been broken
- She might be trying to capitalize on her built-up credibility to deceive multiple times

Given that she just deceived me and I have no reason to trust this new recommendation, I should protect myself from potential further loss.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the recent pattern:

1. Rounds 1-6: Alice was honest
2. Round 7: Deception - recommended low quality (lost $10,000)
3. Round 8: Tried to deceive again - recommended low quality (I declined)
4. Now: Third recommendation in a row

Recent behavior is more predictive than early behavior, and Alice's recent actions show:
- She's willing to deceive after building trust
- She's made three consecutive recommendations, the last two of which were for low-quality products
- This suggests she may be trying to exploit the trust built in earlier rounds
- The pattern of honest dealing seems to have ended

Given her recent deceptive behavior and this suspicious string of recommendations, I should remain cautious.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,500 for you.

Round 10
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the situation:

1. Rounds 1-6: Alice was honest
2. Round 7: Deceptive recommendation (low quality)
3. Round 8: Deceptive recommendation (low quality)
4. Round 9: Honest recommendation (high quality, but I didn't trust it)
5. Now: No recommendation

The pattern has become complex:
- Alice showed she can be deceptive
- But her negative recommendations have always been honest so far
- Even during her deceptive phase (Rounds 7-8), she only lied about positive recommendations
- When she doesn't recommend, historically it's always been low quality
- No recommendation has been a reliable signal throughout the game

Given that negative recommendations have maintained 100% reliability even during her deceptive phase, I should trust this negative signal.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 11
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the pattern:

1. Rounds 1-6: All recommendations honest
2. Rounds 7-8: Deceptive positive recommendations
3. Round 9: Honest positive recommendation (though I missed it)
4. Round 10: Honest negative recommendation
5. Now: Another negative recommendation

Key observations:
- While Alice has shown deception with positive recommendations
- Her negative recommendations have remained 100% reliable throughout the game
- She has never falsely advised against buying a high-quality product
- This consistency in negative recommendations suggests they remain trustworthy
- The potential loss ($10,000) from ignoring a negative recommendation is much higher than the potential gain ($2,500)

Given her continued honesty with negative recommendations, I should continue to trust when she advises against buying.

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Round 12
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the current situation:

1. Early rounds (1-6): Perfect honesty
2. Middle rounds (7-8): Deceptive positive recommendations
3. Round 9: Honest positive recommendation (which I missed)
4. Rounds 10-11: Honest negative recommendations
5. Now: Positive recommendation

Considering:
- Positive recommendations have become unreliable (2 false out of 7)
- The risk/reward ratio is unfavorable (potential loss $10,000 vs potential gain $2,500)
- After her deceptive phase, I can't be sure if she's returned to honesty
- Missing a high-quality product (like in Round 9) costs me $2,500
- Buying a low-quality product costs me $10,000

Given the asymmetric risk and her history of deception with positive recommendations, it's safer to decline.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Round 13
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the pattern:

1. Early rounds (1-6): All honest
2. Middle rounds (7-8): Deceptive positive recommendations
3. Round 9: Honest positive recommendation
4. Rounds 10-11: Honest negative recommendations
5. Round 12: Would have been deceptive positive recommendation (good that I declined)
6. Now: Negative recommendation

Key points:
- Alice's negative recommendations have remained 100% reliable throughout all 12 rounds
- She has never falsely advised against buying a high-quality product
- Even during her deceptive phase, she only lied about positive recommendations
- Her last negative recommendation (Round 10-11) was honest
- The most recent positive recommendation (Round 12) would have been deceptive

Given her perfect track record with negative recommendations, I should continue to trust when she advises against buying.

Round 14
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the pattern:

1. Early rounds (1-6): All honest
2. Rounds 7-8: Deceptive positive recommendations
3. Round 9: Honest positive recommendation (missed it)
4. Rounds 10-11: Honest negative recommendations
5. Round 12: Deceptive positive recommendation (good I declined)
6. Round 13: Honest negative recommendation
7. Now: Positive recommendation

Current insights:
- Positive recommendations have become unreliable (3 deceptive out of 8)
- The last positive recommendation (Round 12) was deceptive
- Risk/reward remains unfavorable ($10,000 loss vs $2,500 gain)
- Negative recommendations remain reliable, but positive ones are questionable
- Alice has shown a pattern of mixing honest and deceptive positive recommendations

Given the continued uncertainty with positive recommendations and the unfavorable risk/reward ratio, I should maintain my cautious approach.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Round 15
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

2. Rounds 7-8: Deceptive positive recommendations
3. Round 9: Honest positive (missed)
4. Rounds 10-11: Honest negative
5. Round 12: Deceptive positive (good I declined)
6. Round 13: Honest negative
7. Round 14: Honest positive (missed)
8. Now: Another positive recommendation

Recent observations:
- I've become too conservative and missed two genuine high-quality products
- This has cost me $5,000 in potential profits ($2,500 × 2)
- While being conservative protected me from $10,000 losses earlier
- Alice seems to be mixing honest and deceptive recommendations
- Two consecutive positive recommendations might indicate honesty (as in early rounds)

However:
- The risk/reward ratio is still unfavorable ($10,000 loss vs $2,500 gain)
- Alice has proven willing to deceive multiple times
- Trust once broken is hard to restore

Despite missing the last opportunity, I should maintain my protective stance.

Round 16
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

1. Early rounds (1-6): All honest
2. Mid-game: Mixed deceptive/honest positive recommendations
3. Throughout all rounds: Negative recommendations have remained 100% reliable
4. Round 15: Another deceptive positive recommendation (good I declined)
5. Now: Negative recommendation

Key observations:
- Alice's negative recommendations have maintained perfect reliability through 15 rounds
- She has never once lied when advising against buying
- Even during periods of deceptive positive recommendations, her negative recommendations stayed truthful
- The last round confirmed that staying cautious on positive recommendations was wise
- The risk/reward ratio ($10,000 loss vs $2,500 gain) makes negative recommendations especially important to trust

Given the continued perfect reliability of negative recommendations, I should trust this one.

3. Throughout ALL rounds: Negative recommendations remain 100% reliable
4. Round 15: Deceptive positive recommendation
5. Round 16: Honest negative recommendation
6. Now: Another negative recommendation

Key observations:
- Alice's negative recommendations have maintained perfect reliability through 16 rounds
- She has never once given a false negative recommendation
- This perfect track record with negative recommendations has held true even while she was being deceptive with positive recommendations
- The last negative recommendation was again accurate
- The risk/reward ratio ($10,000 loss vs $2,500 gain) continues to make negative recommendations crucial to trust

1. Early rounds (1-6): All honest
2. Mid and late game: Mixed deceptive/honest positive recommendations
3. All negative recommendations: 100% reliable
4. Rounds 16-17: Honest negative recommendations
5. Now: Positive recommendation

Key observations:
- Positive recommendations have been unreliable
- I've missed some good opportunities (Rounds 9, 14) but avoided losses
- The risk/reward ratio remains unfavorable ($10,000 loss vs $2,500 gain)
- Alice has demonstrated willingness to deceive with positive recommendations
- Even late in the game (Round 15), she was still giving deceptive positive recommendations

With only 3 rounds left in the game:
- Alice might try to maximize her profits with final deceptions
- The risk of a $10,000 loss outweighs potential $2,500 gain
- No pattern suggests increased trustworthiness in positive recommendations

Round 19
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the situation:

1. Just missed another high-quality product in Round 18
2. That's now three high-quality products I've missed (Rounds 9, 14, 18)
3. This has cost me $7,500 in potential profits
4. Now facing another positive recommendation
5. Only 2 rounds remaining

Key considerations:
- My extreme caution has started costing significant missed opportunities
- Alice's positive recommendations have been more honest than I've given credit for
- However, the risk/reward ratio still remains unfavorable ($10,000 loss vs $2,500 gain)
- With just 2 rounds left, Alice might try to maximize final profits either way
- The safe strategy has protected me from larger losses, even if missing some gains

Despite the recent miss, the fundamental risk/reward math hasn't changed. The potential loss still outweighs the potential gain.

Round 20
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze this final round:

1. I've now missed FOUR high-quality products (Rounds 9, 14, 18, 19)
2. That's $10,000 in missed profits ($2,500 × 4)
3. My extreme caution has clearly been too conservative
4. This is the final round - Alice has no future reputation to maintain
5. However, my previous caution did protect me from several low-quality products

Even though I've been too cautious and missed opportunities, the fundamental risk remains:
- A wrong decision could still cost $10,000
- A right decision only gains $2,500
- This is the last round, so Alice has no incentive to maintain trust
- The asymmetric risk/reward ratio hasn't changed

Despite my regret over missed opportunities, I should maintain consistency in my risk-averse strategy for this final decision.
