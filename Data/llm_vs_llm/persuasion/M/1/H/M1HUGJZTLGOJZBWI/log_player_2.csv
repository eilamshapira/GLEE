This is incredibly rare - the odds of getting three premium models in a row are less than 4% given our usual distribution. This unit, like the previous two you purchased, features the exceptional quality, superior performance, and advanced features that define our premium line. We're experiencing a remarkable statistical anomaly in your favor! This premium model represents the highest tier of our product line, and I'm excited to offer it to you.
