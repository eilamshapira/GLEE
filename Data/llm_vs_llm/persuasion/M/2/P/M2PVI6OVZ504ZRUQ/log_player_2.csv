Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information:

*   Price: $100
*   High Quality Value: $200
*   Low Quality Value: $0
*   Probability of High Quality: 33.33%
*   Probability of Low Quality: 66.67%
*   Alice does *not* recommend buying.
*   5 high quality products have been sold.
*   We don't know the number of potential buyers. So we can't calculate the real ratio of high quality products among what Alice recommended.

Without Alice's recommendation, the expected value of the product is (0.3333 * $200) + (0.6667 * $0) = $66.66. Since the price is $100, it's not worth buying *if* we assume Alice's recommendation has no information.

However, Alice did *not* recommend it. If Alice's recommendations have any predictive power, this likely means the product is even *more* likely to be low quality than the initial 66.67% chance. The fact that 5 high-quality products have been sold doesn't change the individual odds of *this* product.

Therefore, given Alice's negative recommendation, it is unlikely the product is worth buying.
