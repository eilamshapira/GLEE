Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully.

Given information:
- Each product has an 80% chance of being high quality ($1,250,000 value) and 20% chance of low quality ($0 value)
- Price is $1,000,000
- Alice recommends buying the product
- No previous sales history

Expected value calculation:
0.8 × $1,250,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $1,000,000

The expected value equals the price. However, Alice knows the true quality and has chosen to recommend buying. Since Alice is incentivized to sell products (and may especially want to sell low-quality products), her recommendation slightly increases the probability this is a high-quality product.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this decision:

- The price is $1,000,000
- A high-quality product is worth $1,250,000 to me (profit of $250,000)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000)
- The prior probability is 80% high-quality, 20% low-quality
- Alice has sold 1 product so far, and it was high-quality
- Alice is recommending I buy this product

The fact that Alice has only sold high-quality products so far is positive, though with only 1 previous sale, this isn't a large sample. Alice's recommendation is meaningful since she knows the true quality.

Given the prior probability of 80% high-quality and Alice's recommendation, the expected value is:
0.8 × $250,000 - 0.2 × $1,000,000 = $200,000 - $200,000 = $0

Since the expected value is not negative and Alice is recommending the purchase with knowledge of the true quality, I'll buy the product.

Given:
- Each product has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $1,250,000 to me) and 20% chance of being low quality (worth $0)
- The product costs $1,000,000
- Alice recommends that I buy the product
- 2 previous buyers purchased based on Alice's recommendations
- 2 high-quality products have been sold so far

The expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 0.8 × $1,250,000 + 0.2 × $0 - $1,000,000 = $1,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $0
- If I don't buy: $0

However, the fact that 2 out of 2 previous sales were high-quality products suggests that Alice might be truthful in her recommendations. Since Alice is recommending I buy, and she has a perfect track record so far, I'm inclined to trust the recommendation.

- Low-quality product (20% chance) is worth $0 to me
- Alice has sold 3 products so far, all high-quality
- Alice recommends I buy the current product

My expected value analysis:
- If I trust the prior probability: 0.8 × $1,250,000 + 0.2 × $0 - $1,000,000 = $0
- However, Alice has a perfect track record (3/3 high-quality sales)
- Alice is recommending I buy this product

This recommendation combined with the perfect track record suggests this is likely a high-quality product. If it's high-quality, I'd gain $250,000 in value ($1,250,000 - $1,000,000).

Given information:
- Each product has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $1,250,000)
- Each product has a 20% chance of being low quality (worth $0)
- The price is $1,000,000
- Alice has sold 4 products so far, and all 4 were high quality
- Alice recommends that I buy this product

Since Alice has only sold high-quality products so far and is recommending this one, the product is likely high quality. If it is high quality, the expected value is $1,250,000, which exceeds the $1,000,000 price.

The expected value calculation:
- If high quality (likely): $1,250,000 - $1,000,000 = $250,000 profit
- If low quality: $0 - $1,000,000 = -$1,000,000 loss

Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality

Evidence:
- All 5 previous buyers purchased based on Alice's recommendations
- All 5 products sold were high quality
- Alice recommends I buy this product

Since Alice has a perfect record of recommending only high-quality products, and she's recommending this one, the evidence strongly suggests this is a high-quality product. The expected value is positive.

- Purchase price is $1,000,000
- 6 buyers have purchased based on Alice's recommendations, and all 6 got high-quality products
- Alice does NOT recommend I buy the current product

The fact that Alice isn't recommending this product is significant. Since her previous recommendations led to 6 high-quality purchases, she appears to be truthfully steering buyers toward good products. When she now recommends against buying, it strongly suggests the current product is low quality.

Expected value if I buy:
- If product is high quality (unlikely given Alice's recommendation): $1,250,000 - $1,000,000 = $250,000 profit
- If product is low quality (likely given Alice's recommendation): $0 - $1,000,000 = -$1,000,000 loss

Given Alice's track record of accurate recommendations, the risk of losing $1,000,000 is too high.

Given information:
- There's an 80% prior probability of high quality
- Alice has sold 6 products so far, all of which were high quality
- Alice recommends I buy this product

Alice's perfect record suggests she's being honest in her recommendations. If Alice is truthfully revealing quality, then her recommendation indicates this is a high-quality product.

Expected value calculation:

Since Alice has demonstrated reliability with 6 previous buyers receiving high-quality products, and she's recommending this product, purchasing seems rational.

Looking at Alice's track record:
- 8 buyers purchased before me

This perfect track record suggests Alice is giving honest recommendations. Since Alice knows the quality and is recommending purchase, and her previous recommendations have all been accurate, I should trust this recommendation.

From the statistics, I notice that 9 buyers purchased based on Alice's recommendations, and all 9 products turned out to be high quality. This suggests Alice has been truthful in her recommendations.

Now Alice is not recommending that I buy the product. Given her perfect track record so far, this likely means the product is low quality.

Let's check the expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 80% chance of $1,250,000 (worth $1,000,000) and 20% chance of $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
- Expected value = 0.8 × $250,000 - 0.2 × $1,000,000 = $200,000 - $200,000 = $0

However, Alice's recommendation changes my probability assessment. Given her negative recommendation and perfect track record, I should trust that this product is likely low quality.

- Each product has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $1,250,000) and 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)
- Purchase price is $1,000,000
- Expected value of a random product: 0.8 × $1,250,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $1,000,000
- So far, 9 buyers purchased based on Alice's recommendations, and all 9 received high-quality products
- Alice is now recommending that I buy the current product

The perfect track record of Alice's recommendations (9/9 high quality) suggests her recommendations are reliable. Since she's recommending I buy, and the expected value equals the purchase price even without considering her recommendation, this appears to be a good decision.

- Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice's sales record: 10 buyers purchased products, and all 10 received high-quality products
- Alice recommends I buy the product

The fact that all previous sales were high quality and Alice is recommending this product is encouraging. However, I need to be careful about selection bias - we only know about products that were sold, not ones that were rejected.

My expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 0.8 × $250,000 + 0.2 × (-$1,000,000) = $200,000 - $200,000 = $0
