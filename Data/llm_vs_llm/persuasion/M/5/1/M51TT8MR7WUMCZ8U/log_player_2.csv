Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Base probability:
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $120)
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)

2. Expected value calculation:
- (0.8 × $120) + (0.2 × $0) = $96

3. Cost of product: $100

4. Considerations:
- No sales history to reference
- Alice's recommendation could be biased
- Expected value ($96) is less than the cost ($100)

Given that the expected value is less than the cost, and there's no historical data to validate Alice's trustworthiness, it would be rational to decline.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this decision:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (80% chance): $120
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0
3. Expected value = (0.8 × $120) + (0.2 × $0) = $96

The seller recommends buying the product, but since this is the first transaction, we have no historical data to validate their trustworthiness.

Given that:
- The expected value ($96) is slightly less than the price ($100)
- We have no historical data to build trust
- There's a 20% risk of getting no value
- The maximum upside is relatively small ($20)

2. Expected value calculation:

3. Alice's recommendation is positive
4. No prior sales history to reference
5. The expected value ($96) is slightly less than the price ($100)

Even though Alice recommends buying, the expected value is slightly below the purchase price, and there's no track record to build trust. The risk of losing $100 outweighs the potential $20 gain.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Prior probability of high quality: 80%
2. Price: $100
3. Expected value without seller's recommendation:
   * High quality (80%): $120 × 0.8 = $96
   * Low quality (20%): $0 × 0.2 = $0
   * Total expected value = $96

4. Seller's recommendation: Negative
   * This likely indicates the product is low quality
   * The seller appears to be honest since they're recommending against their own interest

5. Given the negative recommendation, the probability of low quality is much higher

Decision: The negative recommendation from the seller strongly suggests this is a low-quality product. Since a low-quality product is worth $0, and the price is $100, I should not buy.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The base probability of a high-quality product is 80%
2. Alice does not recommend buying
3. Alice's incentive is to sell, so a negative recommendation is notable
4. Given no sales history, I can only rely on the base probability and Alice's recommendation
5. Alice's negative recommendation likely indicates a low-quality product

Since Alice is recommending against buying despite having an incentive to sell, and given this is likely a low-quality product that would be worth $0 to me, it's best not to risk the $100 purchase price.

3. Probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
4. Expected value: (0.8 × $120) + (0.2 × $0) = $96

The expected value ($96) is slightly less than the price ($100). However, Alice is recommending the purchase, which might indicate she's being honest about a high-quality product since she wants to build a good reputation with her first sale.

Still, making a purely mathematical decision, the expected value is less than the price, so I should decline.

The perfect track record and Alice's recommendation are positive signals. The fact that all previous sales were high quality suggests Alice is being honest in her recommendations.
