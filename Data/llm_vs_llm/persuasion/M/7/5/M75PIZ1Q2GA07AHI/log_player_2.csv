Alice's message: Hello! I'm excited to offer you a truly exceptional product for the incredible price of $1000000. It's a unique opportunity, and I assure you, you won't find anything like it elsewhere. This product is guaranteed to deliver exceptional value and exceed your expectations. What do you say, are you interested in taking a chance?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this decision:

1. Expected Value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality: 0.8 × $1,200,000 = $960,000
- 20% chance of low quality: 0.2 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $960,000

2. Cost = $1,000,000

3. Expected profit = Expected Value - Cost
= $960,000 - $1,000,000 = -$40,000

Since the expected profit is negative, and there's no prior sales history to provide additional information about Alice's truthfulness, the rational decision would be not to buy.

Alice's message: Hello! I have a high-quality product for sale at $1000000. I understand you might be hesitant given the price, but I assure you, this product is worth every penny. While I can't disclose specifics, I can share that it's a rare and valuable item. This is a chance to own something exceptional. Would you like to learn more?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($1,200,000) = $960,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $960,000

2. Cost of product = $1,000,000

3. Analysis:
- The expected value ($960,000) is less than the cost ($1,000,000)
- There's no sales history to validate Alice's reliability
- Despite Alice's positive message, the pure mathematical expectation suggests a loss

4. Risk assessment:
- 20% chance of complete loss ($1,000,000)
- Even with high quality, profit margin is relatively small ($200,000)

Given that the expected value is less than the cost and there's no track record to build trust, the rational decision is to decline.
