Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the statistics and Alice's recommendation:

- Alice has a 100% success rate so far with selling high-quality products.

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make this decision, let's calculate the expected value of this purchase strategy:

- There have been 2 buyers.
- Both purchased the product, resulting in 2 high-quality products being sold.
- The proportion of high-quality products sold among buyers so far is 100%.

Alice recommends buying the current product, and given the previous track record of Alice's recommendations resulting in high-quality products, it's reasonable to assume that this one might also be high quality.

Considering the probability of the product being high quality based on past recommendations (100%), and its worth to you ($4,000,000), the expected value is high.

Therefore, you'll want to make the decision to buy this product.
