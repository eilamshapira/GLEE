Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information, here's the breakdown of my decision:

*   **Base Probability:** Without any information, there's an 80% chance the product is high quality.
*   **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice *doesn't* recommend buying. This is crucial. It suggests the product Alice showed me is likely low quality.
*   **Alice's Knowledge:** Alice knows the quality of *this specific* product she showed me. This is different from knowing the overall success rate.
*   **Previous Sales:** 2 high-quality products were sold. This information is less relevant *because* Alice has seen the quality of *this* product. The fact that previous products were good doesn't make *this* product good.

Alice not recommending the product strongly suggests it's the 20% chance of a low-quality product.

Therefore, my decision is:

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information, here's my analysis:

*   **Base Probability:** Without any information, the product has an 80% chance of being high quality.
*   **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is not recommending the product. This is a crucial piece of information.
*   **Alice's Knowledge:** Alice knows the quality of *this specific* product being offered to me.
*   **Implication of No Recommendation:** Since Alice knows the quality and is *not* recommending it, it strongly suggests the product is low quality.
*   **Sold Statistics:** The statistics regarding previous sales of 9 high-quality product are irrelevant, as Alice did not recommend the product for the current buyer.

Therefore, the probability that this specific product is high quality is now very low, based on Alice's negative recommendation. Since the product is worth $0 to me if it's low quality, and Alice knows the quality of this product, I should not buy it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my analysis and decision:

*   **Prior Beliefs:** The initial probability of a product being high quality is 80%.

*   **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is *not* recommending the product. This is crucial information. If Alice recommends a product, it's likely high quality. However, since she isn't recommending it, it suggests the product is likely low quality.

*   **Alice's Incentives:** Alice wants to sell products. If she knows the product is high quality, she'd recommend it to maximize her chances of a sale. Her *not* recommending suggests she believes it's likely low quality.

*   **Updated Probability (Bayesian Reasoning):** We need to update our prior belief about the probability of high quality given that Alice did *not* recommend the product. While we don't have enough information for a precise Bayesian calculation, we can qualitatively reason. Alice's negative recommendation significantly lowers the probability of the product being high quality compared to the initial 80%.

*   **Expected Value:**
    *   If the product is high quality, it's worth $30,000.
    *   If the product is low quality, it's worth $0.
    *   The price is $10,000.
    *   Let's denote the probability of the product being high quality after the recommendation is *p*. The expected value of buying is: p * $30,000 + (1-p) * $0 - $10,000 = p * $30,000 - $10,000

*   **Decision:** Given that Alice didn't recommend the product, *p* is likely significantly less than 0.8. If *p* is less than 1/3, the expected value is negative, and so, I will not buy. I will pass on the product.

~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my reasoning:

*   **My Expected Value Without Recommendation:** The expected value of a randomly selected product is (0.8 * $30,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $24,000. Since the price is $10,000, I would buy a product without any other information.

*   **Impact of Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is *not* recommending the product. This is a negative signal.

*   **Bayesian Update:** We need to consider how Alice's negative recommendation shifts the probability of the product being high quality. This is where the provided statistics come into play. We know 12 high-quality products have been sold from an unknown number of offers. The important part is that Alice didn't recommend this one.

*   **Scenario 1: Alice recommends truthfully**: Then the negative recommendation means the product must be low quality, therefore I would decline.

*   **Scenario 2: Alice recommends strategically**: Given the statistics, it is hard to determine whether the recommendation is given truthfully. The best strategy would be to ignore the recommendation, and buy the product.

*   **Final Decision:** Given that I would buy the product with no information, and that there are scenarios in which the quality can't be inferred from the recommendation, the best strategy would be to buy the product.
