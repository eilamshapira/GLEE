"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Expected Value:** Without a recommendation, the expected value of a product is (0.3333 * $12,500) + (0.6667 * $0) = $4,166.25. This is significantly less than the $10,000 asking price.
* **Alice's Silence:** Alice knows the product's quality and how much you value it. Her lack of recommendation suggests it's likely a low-quality product she knows you wouldn't want. 

It's too risky to buy without any indication from Alice that it might be a high-quality product."
