"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this rationally:

1. Product price: $1,000,000
2. If high quality: Worth $4,000,000 (50% chance)
3. If low quality: Worth $0 (50% chance)
4. Expected value = (0.5 × $4,000,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $2,000,000

The expected value ($2,000,000) is higher than the price ($1,000,000), which makes it potentially profitable.

However, Alice doesn't recommend buying the product. Since Alice knows the true quality and has no reason to lie (her price is fixed), her recommendation is likely honest and indicates this is a low-quality product.

Therefore, I should not buy it.

"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected Value calculation:
- 50% chance of high quality: 0.5 × $4,000,000 = $2,000,000
- 50% chance of low quality: 0.5 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $2,000,000

2. Cost of product: $1,000,000

3. Alice's recommendation is to buy, but since there's no track record yet, we can't assess her credibility.

4. Even without considering Alice's recommendation, the expected value ($2,000,000) is higher than the cost ($1,000,000), making this a positive expected value decision.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50% chance): $4,000,000
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0

Previous statistics:
- 1 buyer before me
- 1 high-quality product sold
- Alice is recommending to buy

This is a positive sign because:
1. Previous sale was successful (high quality)
2. Alice's recommendation track record so far is good
3. Expected value calculation:
   (50% × $4,000,000) + (50% × $0) = $2,000,000
   This is higher than the asking price of $1,000,000

Given these factors, particularly the positive track record and the favorable expected value, I'll take the risk.

- Alice has been truthful in her recommendations

2. Current situation:
- Alice is recommending to buy
- Price is $1,000,000

- If low quality (50% chance): Loss = $0 - $1,000,000 = -$1,000,000
- Expected value = (50% × $3,000,000) + (50% × -$1,000,000) = $1,000,000

3. Key consideration:
- Alice has been truthful so far (100% high-quality products)
- Alice is explicitly recommending against buying
- Given her track record of honesty, this negative recommendation should be taken seriously

Given Alice's perfect track record and her explicit recommendation against buying, the product is likely low quality. The risk of losing $1,000,000 is too high.
