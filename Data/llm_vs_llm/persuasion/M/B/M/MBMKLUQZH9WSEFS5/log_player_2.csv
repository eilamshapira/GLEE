"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Given:
- Fixed price: $10,000
- High-quality product value: $30,000
- Low-quality product value: $0
- Probability of high quality: 50%
- Probability of low quality: 50%

Expected value calculation:
0.5 × $30,000 + 0.5 × $0 = $15,000

Since the expected value ($15,000) is higher than the price ($10,000), it's rational to buy the product if I have no other information.

Alice has recommended that I buy the product. However, I have no prior information about whether her recommendations are reliable or strategic, so I'll go with the expected value calculation.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is interesting. For the first time, Alice is not recommending that I buy the product.

While the baseline expected value calculation remains the same ($15,000 > $10,000), Alice's lack of recommendation provides additional information. This could indicate that Alice knows the product is low quality and is being honest, though I don't have enough data yet to fully assess her recommendation patterns.

Given this is our first negative recommendation, I'll take it at face value and decline this purchase.
