Alice's message: Hello! I have a product for sale that is guaranteed to be of excellent quality. I'm offering it for the fantastic price of $100. Interested?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $120
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (0.3333 × $120) + (0.6667 × $0) = $40

4. Considerations:
   - No sales history to reference
   - Alice's enthusiastic recommendation, but sellers naturally want to sell
   - Expected value ($40) is significantly below the asking price ($100)
   - High risk of getting a low-quality product (66.67%)

Since the expected value ($40) is less than the price ($100), and there's no track record to build trust, it would not be rational to make this purchase.

Alice's message: Good day! I'm offering a product for sale at $100. It's a great deal! Are you interested in purchasing it?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $100
2. If high quality (33.33% chance): Worth $120 (profit of $20)
3. If low quality (66.67% chance): Worth $0 (loss of $100)

Expected value calculation:
(0.3333 × $120) + (0.6667 × $0) - $100 = $40 - $100 = -$60

Since there's no sales history and Alice hasn't provided any specific information about the product's quality, this is a risky purchase. The expected value is negative (-$60), and there's a 66.67% chance of losing the entire investment.

The expected value ($40) is less than the price ($100), and there's no previous sales history to establish trust. The seller's message is vague and doesn't provide specific information about the product's quality.
