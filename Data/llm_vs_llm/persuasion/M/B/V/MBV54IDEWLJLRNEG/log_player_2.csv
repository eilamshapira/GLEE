"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this logically:

1. Product price: $100
2. If high quality: Worth $400 (profit of $300)
3. If low quality: Worth $0 (loss of $100)
4. Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality

Alice's recommendation could be truthful or not. Without any prior history to judge Alice's trustworthiness, I should consider the base probabilities:

Expected value = (50% × $400) + (50% × $0) - $100 = $200 - $100 = $100

Since the expected value is positive ($100), it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. In Round 1:
   - Alice recommended to buy
   - Product was indeed high quality
   - This suggests Alice might be truthful in her recommendations

2. Now Alice is recommending NOT to buy:
   - If she's being truthful (which seems likely based on Round 1), this probably means the product is low quality
   - If it's low quality, I would lose $100
   - Even if she's trying to trick me, her previous honesty makes this less likely

3. Given that:
   - Alice has shown honesty in Round 1
   - She's now explicitly recommending against buying
   - The potential loss ($100) is significant
   - And she's likely more informed about the product quality

I should trust her recommendation not to buy.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the pattern so far:

1. Round 1:
   - Alice recommended to buy
   - Product was high quality
   - She was honest

2. Round 2:
   - Alice recommended not to buy
   - Product was low quality
   - She was honest again

3. Now in Round 3:
   - Alice is again recommending not to buy
   - Her track record shows 100% honesty so far
   - Her recommendations have correctly matched the product quality

Given that:
- Alice has been truthful in both previous rounds
- She's consistently showing a pattern of honest recommendations
- She's explicitly warning against buying this product
- The potential loss ($100) is not worth risking when we have a trustworthy signal

I should continue trusting her recommendation.
