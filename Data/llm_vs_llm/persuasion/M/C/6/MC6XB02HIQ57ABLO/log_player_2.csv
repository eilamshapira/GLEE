Alice's message: I'm offering this product to you for $100. I want to be upfront with you - my track record so far hasn't been great, with only one high-quality product out of the five I've sold.

Alice's message: I'm offering this product to you for $100. I need to be honest with you - my track record so far is pretty spotty, with only one high-quality product out of the six I've offered. The last buyer didn't take a chance on me, and I don't blame them. If you're still willing to take the risk, I appreciate your willingness to give me a chance. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not making any promises about this product's quality.

Alice's message: I'm offering this product to you for $100. I have to be upfront with you - my track record is getting worse, not better. Out of the seven products I've sold, only one was high-quality, and the last buyer who took a chance on me ended up with a low-quality product. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - the odds are against you getting a good product from me. If you're still willing to take the risk, I'll be honest with you about what you're getting into.

Alice's message: I'm offering this product to you for $100. I need to be brutally honest with you - my track record is pretty bad. Out of the eight products I've offered, only one was high-quality, and the last buyer wisely decided not to take a chance on me. I'm not expecting you to buy this product, and I wouldn't blame you if you didn't. However, if you're feeling lucky or just want to take a chance, I'll be upfront with you about the risks involved.

Alice's message: I'm offering this product to you for $100. Honestly, I'm not sure why you'd want to buy from me at this point. My track record is abysmal - one high-quality product out of nine, and the last two buyers have wisely decided to steer clear. I'm not going to try to spin this or make any promises. If you buy from me, you're taking a huge risk. I just want to be upfront with you about what you're getting into.

Alice's message: I'm offering this product to you for $100. I'm genuinely surprised that the last buyer took a chance on me, despite my terrible track record. Unfortunately, they ended up with a low-quality product, just like most of my previous buyers. I'm not going to try to convince you to buy from me - my numbers speak for themselves. One high-quality product out of ten is a pretty dismal record. If you're still willing to take the risk, I'll be honest with you about what you're getting into, but I wouldn't recommend it.

Alice's message: I'm offering this product to you for $100. I know my track record is laughable at this point - one high-quality product out of eleven. But I want to be honest with you, I've got a good feeling about this one. It's a high-quality product, and I think it's worth taking a chance on. I know I've let a lot of buyers down in the past, but I'm hoping to turn things around with this one. If you're willing to take a chance on me, I promise you won't be disappointed this time.

My track record is still terrible - one high-quality product out of twelve, and the last buyer didn't even take a chance on me when I had a good product to offer. This one, unfortunately, is not a good product. I'm just being honest with you. If you buy from me, you're likely to end up with a low-quality product. I wouldn't recommend it.

Alice's message: I'm offering this product to you for $100. Honestly, I don't think you should buy it. My track record is one high-quality product out of thirteen, and I've consistently disappointed buyers with low-quality products. This one is no exception. I'm not even going to try to convince you to take a chance on me. It's just not worth the risk. Save your money and look elsewhere for a better product from a more reliable seller.

Alice's message: I'm offering this product to you for $100. I'm shocked that the last buyer took a chance on me, despite my warnings. Unfortunately, they ended up with a low-quality product, just like I told them they would. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - my products are generally not good, and this one is no exception. One high-quality product out of fourteen is a terrible record. I'm starting to think that some buyers just like taking risks or something. If you're one of those people, then I suppose this product is available to you. But I'm seriously warning you, it's not worth it.

Alice's message: I'm offering this product to you for $100. I know my track record is still terrible - one high-quality product out of fifteen. But I want to be honest with you, this one is actually a good product. I'm not just saying that to try to make a sale, I'm saying it because it's true. Unfortunately, my previous buyers have been burned so many times that I don't expect you to believe me. But I'm hoping that you'll take a chance on me, despite my past failures. This product is genuinely worth the money, and I think you'll be happy with it if you buy it.

Alice's message: I'm offering this product to you for $100. I'm not even going to try to convince you to buy it. My track record is one high-quality product out of sixteen, and I just had a good product that nobody wanted because of my terrible reputation. This one, unfortunately, is not a good product. It's just another low-quality item in a long line of disappointments. I'm starting to think that I should just be honest with myself and admit that I'm not a good seller. If you buy this product, you'll probably regret it. Don't say I didn't warn you.

Alice's message: I'm offering this product to you for $100. I'm starting to lose hope here. I've had two good products in a row that I couldn't sell because of my terrible reputation, and then I sold a bad product to someone who didn't listen to my warnings. This one, I swear, is a good product. It's high-quality, and I think you'll be happy with it. But I've said that before, and nobody believes me anymore. I don't blame you if you don't want to take a chance on me. My track record is one high-quality product out of seventeen, and that's just not good enough. But if you're feeling generous, or if you want to take a chance on a seller who's desperate to turn things around, then this product is available to you.

Alice's message: I'm offering this product to you for $100. I'm not going to lie to you, I'm shocked that the last buyer took a chance on me and actually got a good product. But don't think that means I've turned a corner or anything. This product is a return to form for me - it's low-quality, and you shouldn't waste your money on it. My track record is still terrible, two high-quality products out of eighteen, and I don't expect you to believe me when I say that this one is bad. But I'm telling you anyway. Don't buy this product. You'll regret it.

Alice's message: I'm offering this product to you for $100. I don't even know what to say anymore. My track record is two high-quality products out of nineteen, and I've consistently warned buyers about the low-quality products, but they just keep buying them anyway. This one is no exception - it's a bad product, and you shouldn't buy it. I'm not even going to try to convince you otherwise. If you're looking to throw your money away on a low-quality product, then I suppose this is the product for you. But if you have any sense at all, you'll stay far, far away from me and my terrible products.
