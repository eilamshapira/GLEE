Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($4,000,000) heavily outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0). Alice's recommendation also adds a bit of confidence, although it's not a foolproof indicator. Given the lack of historical data, it's a gamble worth taking."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information about the product's quality. The only data point we have is that one high-quality product was sold.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. While we don't know her motivations, we can assume she's likely to recommend a product she believes is good. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of a high-quality product ($4,000,000) is significantly higher than the potential loss ($1,000,000).

**Conclusion:** Even with limited information, the potential reward outweighs the risk. It's a gamble, but a calculated one."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Previous data is strong:** 100% of the products sold so far have been high quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are highly reliable, even though the initial probability of a high-quality product is only 80%.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Since Alice recommends buying, it further strengthens the likelihood that the current product is high quality. 

While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($4,000,000) outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 3 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 3 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 4th buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The historical data shows a 100% success rate (3 high-quality products out of 3 sales). This suggests that Alice's recommendations are highly accurate.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, which further strengthens the likelihood of it being high quality.
* **Potential Gain vs. Loss:**  Even if there's a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain of $4,000,000 (if it's high quality) outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000 (if it's low quality).

**Overall:** Given the information available, it's a calculated risk worth taking. The odds are significantly in favor of the product being high quality."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 4 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 4 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 5th buyer!

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

Here's the reasoning:

* **All previously recommended products were high quality.** This is a strong indicator that Alice's recommendations are reliable.
* **The base probability of a high-quality product is 80%.**  Even without Alice's recommendation, the odds are in your favor.

Given the strong track record and the favorable odds, buying the product is the logical choice."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 6 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 6 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 7th buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Perfect track record:**  Alice has a 100% success rate in recommending high-quality products so far. This is incredibly strong evidence that her recommendations are reliable.
* **High potential value:** Even with the 20% risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $4,000,000 for a high-quality product far outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000.

Given the seller's perfect track record and the potential for a huge return, buying the product seems like the logical decision."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:** The sales history shows that Alice has only sold high-quality products so far. This is highly unusual given the 80/20 probability distribution of product quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the purchase further reinforces the high probability of the product being high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of $4,000,000 outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000, especially given the extremely favorable sales record.

While there's still a theoretical 20% chance of the product being low quality, the evidence strongly suggests otherwise. It's a calculated risk, but the potential payoff is significant."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 8 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 8 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 9th buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** All previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation ended up with a high-quality product. This suggests Alice has a strong ability to identify high-quality products.
* **Low Risk:** While there's always a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward of $4,000,000 significantly outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000.

**Conclusion:** The information provided strongly suggests the current product is likely high-quality, making it a worthwhile investment despite the risk."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 9 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 9 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 10th buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

The information provided suggests a strong bias towards high-quality products.  Since 9 out of 9 products sold were high-quality, it's highly likely that the current product is also high-quality.  Even though there's still a 20% chance of it being low-quality, the potential reward of $4,000,000 outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000.  It's a calculated risk with very favorable odds."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 10 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 10 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 11th buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:**  Alice has a 100% success rate with her recommendations. Every product she recommended has been high quality.
* **High Expected Value:** Even with a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($4,000,000) outweighs the potential loss ($1,000,000). 
* **No Loss of Opportunity:** Even if you pass, the product is discarded. This means you aren't losing the chance to buy it later with potentially more information.

While there's still a chance the product is low-quality, the data strongly suggests it's high-quality, and the potential reward makes the risk worth taking."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 11 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 11 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 12th buyer!

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since 13 buyers have purchased the product and all of them received high-quality products, it's reasonable to assume the seller has a perfect track record of selling only high-quality products. Even with the initial 80% chance of a high-quality product, a 100% success rate in previous sales strongly suggests the product offered is likely high-quality. The recommendation from Alice further strengthens this belief. 

Therefore, the risk of buying a low-quality product is extremely low, making the decision to buy the product a rational choice."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 14 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 14 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 15th buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:**  Alice has a 100% success rate in recommending high-quality products. This is a strong indicator that her recommendations are reliable.
* **No Risk:** You are not losing anything if you buy the product. If it's low quality, it's worth $0 to you, and you've lost the purchase price. If it's high quality, you gain $3,000,000. 
* **Limited Information:** You don't have any information about the specific product offered to you. You only have Alice's recommendation and the historical data. 

**Decision:** Given the strong success rate of Alice's recommendations, the low risk of buying, and the lack of information about the specific product, it's a logical decision to buy the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 15 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 15 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 16th buyer!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, despite having access to the true quality of the product, is not recommending the purchase. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low-quality.
* **Sales Data:**  The fact that 15 high-quality products were sold out of 15 purchases indicates that Alice has consistently recommended high-quality products in the past. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of buying a high-quality product ($4,000,000) is significant, but the risk of buying a low-quality product ($0) is equally substantial. 

Given the combination of Alice's negative recommendation and the consistently positive sales data, the risk of buying a low-quality product is too high.  It's more prudent to pass on this offer."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 15 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 15 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 16th buyer!

~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since all 16 products sold were high-quality, and Alice is recommending against buying this product, it is highly likely that this product is low-quality. Given the potential for a $0 return, it's not worth the risk of buying."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who has access to the product's quality, does not recommend buying it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. 
* **Sales History:** 17 buyers have purchased products, and all 17 were high quality. This creates a bias in the sales history. While it suggests Alice might be good at identifying high-quality products, it doesn't guarantee the current product is also high quality.
* **Risk/Reward:** The potential gain from a high-quality product is significant ($4,000,000), but the risk of a low-quality product is equally significant (losing $1,000,000). 

Given Alice's negative recommendation and the uncertain nature of the current product, passing is the more sensible decision."
