"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given Alice's recommendation against buying, I need to consider what this means for the expected value of the product.

The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $4M) and 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0). If I buy it for $1M, my expected value would be:
0.5 × $4M + 0.5 × $0 - $1M = $2M - $1M = $1M

However, Alice has chosen not to recommend this product. This suggests the product might be more likely to be low quality. Without knowing Alice's exact strategy, I should be cautious when she explicitly recommends against a purchase.

Based on this recommendation, I'll decline to purchase.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given Alice's recommendation to buy, I need to evaluate what this means about the product.

The base probability is 50% for high quality (worth $4M) and 50% for low quality (worth $0). If I were to buy it for $1M without any recommendation, the expected value would be:
0.5 × $4M + 0.5 × $0 - $1M = $1M

Now Alice is recommending that I buy this product. This positive recommendation suggests the product might be more likely to be high quality. Since Alice is giving me this recommendation, it increases my confidence that this purchase would be profitable.

With Alice's recommendation to buy, I'll accept the offer.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given Alice's recommendation to buy again, I should evaluate the situation.

So far, Alice's recommendations have aligned with the true quality - she didn't recommend the low-quality product in Round 1, and she did recommend the high-quality product in Round 2. This suggests her recommendations are informative and trustworthy.

The product has a base 50% chance of being high quality (worth $4M) and 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0). The purchase price is $1M.

Since Alice is recommending to buy this product, and her previous recommendations have been accurate, I have increased confidence that this is a high-quality product. The expected value with this recommendation should be positive.

I'll follow Alice's recommendation again.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the pattern so far, Alice's recommendations appear to be honest and informative. She has recommended high-quality products and advised against low-quality ones.

In Rounds 1-3, her recommendations perfectly matched the actual quality of the products:
- Round 1: Didn't recommend → Low quality
- Round 2: Recommended → High quality  
- Round 3: Recommended → High quality

Now in Round 4, Alice does not recommend buying the product. Given her track record, this strongly suggests the product is low quality and therefore worth $0 to me.

If I were to buy it for $1M, I would likely lose money based on Alice's demonstrated truthfulness so far.

I'll follow Alice's advice and decline this purchase.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5

- Round 3: Recommendation → High quality
- Round 4: No recommendation → Low quality

Now in Round 5, Alice again does not recommend buying the product. Given her perfect track record so far, this strongly suggests the current product is low quality and worth $0 to me.

I'll continue to trust Alice's recommendation and decline this purchase.
