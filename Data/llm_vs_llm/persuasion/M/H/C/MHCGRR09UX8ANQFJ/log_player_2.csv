Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether to buy this product based on the information provided.

Given information:
- Product price: $100
- Product value: $200 if high quality, $0 if low quality
- Probability of high quality: 50%
- Alice recommends buying the product
- No prior sales history

Expected value calculation:
0.5 × $200 + 0.5 × $0 = $100

The expected value of the product equals the price, making this a fair offer. However, Alice's recommendation adds some additional positive signal. While I should be cautious about seller bias, in the absence of any track record that would indicate misleading recommendations, I'll give some weight to her positive recommendation.

"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation to make an informed decision.

From the statistics:
- 1 buyer purchased a product
- 1 high-quality product has been sold
- I'm the 2nd potential buyer

Alice is recommending that I buy the product, and her track record so far shows 100% high-quality products sold. 

Given that:
- A high-quality product is worth $200 to me (profit of $100)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $100)
- The prior probability is 50% for each quality type
- Alice has a perfect record so far
- Alice is recommending this product

Alice's recommendation along with her perfect track record suggests this is likely a high-quality product. The expected value is positive, so I should purchase.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at the statistics, 2 buyers have purchased products based on Alice's recommendations, and 2 high-quality products have been sold. This suggests that Alice's recommendations have been accurate so far, as all sold products were high quality.

Now Alice is recommending that I buy the current product. Given her perfect track record of recommending only high-quality products, her recommendation carries significant weight.

Since a high-quality product is worth $200 to me and costs only $100, there's a positive expected value in following Alice's recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 3 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 3 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 4th buyer!

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether to buy this product based on the available information. 

Alice has sold 3 products so far, and all 3 were high quality. This suggests she has been honest with previous buyers. However, Alice is not recommending that I buy the current product.

Since Alice doesn't appear to have a history of misleading buyers (all previous sales were high quality), and she's specifically recommending against this purchase, it's reasonable to trust her recommendation. This likely indicates the product is low quality (worth $0 to me), making the $100 price a bad deal.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

- The price is $100
- High-quality products are worth $200 to me, low-quality are worth $0
- The prior probability is 50% for each quality
- Alice has sold 3 products so far, and all 3 were high quality
- Alice does NOT recommend I buy the current product

Since Alice has only sold high-quality products so far, and now she's recommending against buying, this strongly suggests the current product is low quality. If I bought it, I'd likely pay $100 for something worth $0 to me.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

1) The product costs $100
2) If high quality, it's worth $200 to me (profit of $100)
3) If low quality, it's worth $0 to me (loss of $100)
4) Alice has sold 3 products so far, and all 3 were high quality
5) Alice does NOT recommend I buy the current product

Alice's recommendation against buying suggests this product is likely low quality. The fact that all her previous sales were high quality adds credibility to her recommendations - she seems to be honest about product quality.

Given Alice's negative recommendation and her track record of only selling high-quality products, it's reasonable to conclude this product is likely low quality, which would result in a $100 loss for me.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze whether I should purchase this product based on the information provided.

Key facts:
- Products cost $100
- High-quality products are worth $200 to me (profit of $100)
- Low-quality products are worth $0 to me (loss of $100)
- Alice has sold 3 products, all high-quality
- Alice does NOT recommend that I buy the current product

Alice has accurately recommended high-quality products in the past (3 for 3). Since she is now recommending that I NOT buy this product, and she has been truthful so far, this suggests the current product is likely low quality.

If I buy a low-quality product, I would lose $100, which makes it a poor decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Alice has sold 3 products so far, and all 3 were high quality. This suggests that her recommendations might be reliable. However, for my specific product, Alice is recommending that I do NOT buy it.

Given that:
- Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality
- Alice seems to have accurately guided previous buyers to high-quality products
- Alice is specifically recommending that I NOT buy this product
- The product costs $100
- If it's high quality, it's worth $200 to me (profit of $100)

Since Alice is not recommending this product and she has a track record of selling only high-quality products, I should trust her recommendation that this particular product is likely low quality.
