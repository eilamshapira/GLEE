Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 
   - 50% chance of $200 (high quality)
   - 50% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value: (0.5 × $200) + (0.5 × $0) = $100
4. Alice recommends buying
5. No historical data to reference

The expected value equals the price, and Alice recommends buying. While there's no track record to verify Alice's trustworthiness, there's no evidence of dishonesty either. Given the neutral expected value and positive recommendation, I'll take the chance.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Previous statistics:
- 1 buyer before me
- 1 purchase made
- 1 high-quality product sold
- 100% success rate so far

2. Current situation:
- Alice is not recommending the product
- Price is $100
- Product could be worth $200 (50% chance) or $0 (50% chance)
- Alice has been honest so far (100% high-quality products sold)
- Alice is explicitly warning me against this product

Given that Alice has shown honesty with the previous buyer (selling a high-quality product) and is now actively recommending against this purchase, it's likely that she's being truthful and this is a low-quality product.

1. Price: $100

   - Low quality: $0 (total loss)
3. Previous statistics:
   - 1 buyer before me
   - 1 purchase made
   - 1 high-quality product sold
4. Alice recommends buying

The fact that the previous sale was a high-quality product and Alice is recommending this one are positive indicators. The track record shows 100% success so far, though with a small sample size. Given Alice's recommendation and the positive history, even though limited, the expected value seems favorable.

1. Previous track record:
- 2 buyers so far
- 2 sales completed
- Both were high-quality products (100% high quality rate)

2. Alice's current recommendation:
- She recommends buying the product

3. Risk assessment:
- Cost: $100
- Potential value: $200 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Expected value with 50% probability: $100

4. Trust factors:
- Alice's previous recommendations led to positive outcomes
- Her current recommendation aligns with her track record
- She has maintained 100% high-quality sales so far

Given Alice's perfect track record and her positive recommendation, this seems like a reasonable risk to take. The previous success rate and her recommendation provide some confidence.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Previous sales:
- 3 buyers purchased products
- All 3 products sold were high quality
- Perfect track record so far (100% high quality)

2. Alice's recommendation:
- She's recommending me to buy
- Her previous recommendations have been accurate
- She has a perfect credibility record

3. Economics:
- Cost: $100
- Potential value: $200 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Expected value with 50/50 chance: $100
- But Alice's recommendation and track record suggest higher probability of high quality

Given Alice's perfect track record and her positive recommendation, the probability of this being a high-quality product seems significantly higher than 50%. The risk appears low based on previous outcomes.
