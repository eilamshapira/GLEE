Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected Value calculation:
- 33.33% chance of high quality ($2,000,000) = $666,667
- 66.67% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $666,667

2. Cost of product = $1,000,000

3. Considerations:
- Expected value ($666,667) is less than the cost ($1,000,000)
- No previous sales history to evaluate Alice's credibility
- Even with Alice's recommendation, the mathematical expectation doesn't justify the purchase

Since the expected value is lower than the cost, and there's no track record to assess Alice's truthfulness, it would be financially unwise to make the purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected Value Calculation:
* High quality (33.33%): $2,000,000 × 0.3333 = $666,660
* Low quality (66.67%): $0 × 0.6667 = $0
* Total Expected Value = $666,660

2. Cost: $1,000,000

3. Considerations:
* The expected value ($666,660) is less than the cost ($1,000,000)
* There's no historical data to evaluate Alice's recommendations
* Alice's recommendation could be biased as she's trying to make a sale
* The risk of losing $1,000,000 is significant

Given that the expected value is lower than the cost, and there's no track record to trust Alice's recommendation, it would be financially unwise to make this purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33%): $2,000,000
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0

Expected value = (0.3333 × $2,000,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $666,600

Since the expected value ($666,600) is less than the price ($1,000,000), and there's no historical data to validate Alice's trustworthiness regarding her recommendations, it would be risky to buy.

Even though Alice recommends buying, without any track record of her recommendations' reliability, the pure probability calculation suggests this is not a good investment.

While Alice recommends buying, since there's no track record yet and the seller has an incentive to sell regardless of quality, this recommendation doesn't carry much weight.
