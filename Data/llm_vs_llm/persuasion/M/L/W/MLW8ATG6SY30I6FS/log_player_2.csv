Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality (50% chance): $120
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0
3. Expected value: (0.5 × $120) + (0.5 × $0) = $60
4. Alice recommends buying, but as a seller, she has an incentive to sell regardless of quality
5. No historical data to validate Alice's reliability

Since the expected value ($60) is less than the price ($100), and there's no historical data to trust Alice's recommendation, it would be rational to decline.

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 
   - 50% chance of $120 (high quality)
   - 50% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value: (0.5 × $120) + (0.5 × $0) = $60
4. Alice has recommended buying
5. No prior sales history to evaluate Alice's trustworthiness

Given that the expected value ($60) is less than the price ($100), and there's no historical data to establish Alice's credibility, it would be risky to make this purchase. Even with Alice's recommendation, without any track record, we can't be sure if the recommendation is reliable.

5. No previous sales history to base decision on

Since the expected value ($60) is less than the price ($100), and there's no sales history to validate Alice's trustworthiness, it would be risky to buy. Even with Alice's recommendation, there's insufficient information to justify the purchase.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this decision:

1. Price is $100
2. If high quality (50% chance), value is $120 (profit of $20)
3. If low quality (50% chance), value is $0 (loss of $100)
4. Alice doesn't recommend buying
5. No previous sales history to base decision on

Expected value without Alice's recommendation:
(50% × $120) + (50% × $0) - $100 = -$40

Given that Alice doesn't recommend the purchase and there's no prior history to establish trust, it's safer to decline. The expected value is negative, and the seller's recommendation reinforces this.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Price of product: $100
2. High quality (50% chance): Worth $120
3. Low quality (50% chance): Worth $0
4. No previous sales data to reference
5. Alice does NOT recommend buying

The fact that Alice doesn't recommend buying is a significant signal. As a rational seller who wants to maintain a good reputation, Alice's negative recommendation likely indicates this is a low-quality product. 

Even without her recommendation, the expected value calculation would be:
(50% × $120) + (50% × $0) = $60

Since $60 is less than the $100 price, and Alice specifically recommends against buying, the rational choice is not to buy.

The expected value ($60) is less than the price ($100), and there's no historical data to provide additional confidence. Even with Alice's recommendation, the risk of losing $100 for a $0 value product is too high compared to the potential $20 gain on a high-quality product.

There's no sales history to base my decision on, so I can only consider:
- The expected value ($60) is less than the price ($100)
- Alice's recommendation, but since she's the seller, there might be bias

Given that the expected value is lower than the price, and there's no track record to establish trust, it would be risky to buy.
