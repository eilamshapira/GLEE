Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While there is a 20% chance the product is low quality, Alice knows the value of each product.  Since she recommends buying, we can assume she has a high confidence the product is high quality. The potential reward ($200) significantly outweighs the potential loss ($0).  As the first buyer, there is no historical data to inform our decision.  This makes the recommendation from Alice even more valuable."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice has a strong incentive to recommend products that are high-quality, as this leads to more sales and a better reputation.  Her recommendation is a strong signal.
* **Past data:**  The previous buyer bought a high-quality product. While one data point is not definitive, it suggests that Alice might be offering more high-quality products. 

**Overall:** The combination of Alice's recommendation and the limited but positive past data makes it a good gamble to buy the product. The potential reward ($200) outweighs the risk ($0)."
