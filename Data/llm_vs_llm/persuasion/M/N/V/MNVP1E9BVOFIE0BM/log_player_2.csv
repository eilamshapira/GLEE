Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33%): $1,200,000 (profit of $200,000)
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0 (loss of $1,000,000)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (33.33% × $1,200,000) + (66.67% × $0) - $1,000,000
   = $400,000 - $1,000,000
   = -$600,000

Even with Alice's recommendation, the expected value is negative. Without any track record to establish trust in Alice's recommendations, and given that the probability of a low-quality product is twice that of a high-quality product, it's too risky.

3. Expected value calculation:
   (33.33% × $1,200,000) + (66.67% × $0) = $400,000

4. Since the expected value ($400,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), it would be a negative expected value decision to buy.

5. While Alice recommends buying, there's no track record to establish her credibility, and she has an incentive to sell regardless of quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33%): $1,200,000
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.3333 × $1,200,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $400,000

The expected value ($400,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), and since there's no previous sales history to evaluate Alice's credibility, this would be a risky purchase. Even with Alice's recommendation, the mathematical expectation suggests this is not a good investment.

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Expected value calculation:
   * 33.33% chance of high quality ($1,200,000) = $400,000

   * Total expected value = $400,000

3. Alice is recommending to buy, but:
   * There's no track record to verify her credibility
   * The expected value ($400,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000)
   * Risk of total loss is high (66.67%)

Since the expected value is significantly below the asking price, and there's no historical data to trust Alice's recommendation, it would be financially unwise to make this purchase.

Even with Alice's recommendation, the expected value is negative. There's no track record to verify Alice's reliability, and the downside risk ($1M loss) is much larger than the potential upside ($200K gain).
