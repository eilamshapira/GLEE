"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this rationally:

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($12,500) = $10,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $10,000

Price = $10,000

Since the expected value equals the price, and Alice has recommended buying, I'll trust her recommendation as there's no incentive for her to mislead me in this scenario.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has no incentive to lie since she gets the same $10,000 whether the product is high or low quality. Therefore, if she's not recommending the purchase, it's likely because she knows it's a low-quality product.

Given that Alice explicitly recommends against buying, and she has perfect information about the product's quality, I should trust her recommendation to avoid buying.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has been honest in the previous two rounds, and her incentives align with being truthful since she gets the same price regardless of quality.

When she recommended buying in Round 1, it was indeed a high-quality product. When she recommended against buying in Round 2, it was indeed a low-quality product.

Given that she's recommending to buy this product, and she has shown to be trustworthy, I should follow her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has maintained perfect honesty in her recommendations so far:
- Round 1: Recommended buy → High quality
- Round 2: Recommended don't buy → Low quality
- Round 3: Recommended buy → High quality
- Round 4: Now recommending don't buy

Her incentives remain aligned with honesty (she gets $10,000 either way), and she has demonstrated consistent truthfulness. When she recommends against buying, it's likely because she knows it's a low-quality product that would be worth $0 to me.

Following her proven reliable guidance:

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to demonstrate perfect reliability in her recommendations:
- All her ""buy"" recommendations were high-quality products
- All her ""don't buy"" recommendations were low-quality products

Since she's recommending against buying again, and she has proven to be completely trustworthy with her perfect track record, I should follow her advice. There's no reason for her to lie since she would get the same $10,000 either way.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

- When she recommends buying, the products have been high quality
- When she recommends not buying, the products have been low quality

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

- Every time she's recommended buying, it was a high-quality product worth $12,500
- Every time she's recommended not buying, it was a low-quality product worth $0

Since she's recommending to buy again, and she has maintained a perfect track record of honest recommendations (with no incentive to lie since she gets $10,000 either way), I should trust her recommendation.

"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
