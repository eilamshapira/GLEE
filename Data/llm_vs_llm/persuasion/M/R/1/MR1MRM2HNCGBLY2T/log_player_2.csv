```

**Reasoning:**

Since no products have been sold yet, there is no historical data to analyze.  You are essentially making a decision based on a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product, which is worth $3,000,000, versus a low-quality product, which is worth $0.

Since the potential gain ($3,000,000) far outweighs the potential loss ($0), it makes sense to take the risk and buy the product."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only know that Alice has sold one high-quality product before. This is not enough to determine the quality of the current product.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation carries some weight. While she doesn't know the value of the product to you, she has some information about its quality that you don't.
* **Potential Reward vs. Risk:**  The potential reward ($3,000,000) is significantly higher than the potential loss ($1,000,000). 

**Given the limited information and the potential for a large profit, it's better to take the risk and buy the product.**"

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal.  Even though the historical sales record is positive (all sold products were high quality), the fact that Alice is not recommending this product means she likely sees it as low quality.  Since a low-quality product is worth $0 to you, it's not worth the risk of the $1,000,000 purchase."

{""decision"": ""no""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is not recommending the product, which is a strong signal that it might be low quality. 
* **Perfect Track Record:**  The sales record shows that all 5 previous buyers who purchased based on Alice's recommendations got high-quality products. This suggests that Alice is a reliable source of information.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of getting a high-quality product is high ($3,000,000). However, the risk of getting a low-quality product and losing $1,000,000 is equally high. Given Alice's non-recommendation, the risk outweighs the reward.

**Conclusion:** It's best to pass on this product."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who has seen the product's quality, is not recommending it. This is a strong signal that it's likely a low-quality product.
* **Sales Record:**  All 5 previous buyers purchased high-quality products. This suggests that Alice has been recommending high-quality products consistently. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward (a $3 million profit) is significant, but the risk (a $1 million loss) is also very high given Alice's recommendation and the established pattern.

**Conclusion:**  The risk of buying a low-quality product outweighs the potential reward, especially given Alice's recommendation.  Passing on the product is the more rational decision."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendations have been perfect so far, with all 5 buyers receiving high-quality products.  Since there's a 50/50 chance of a product being high or low quality, this is highly unlikely to happen by chance. This strongly suggests Alice has a way of identifying high-quality products. Therefore, even though the price is high, the recommendation makes it extremely likely that this product is also high-quality, making it a worthwhile purchase."

* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of a high-quality product is significant, but the risk of a low-quality product is also substantial, costing you $1,000,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal.
