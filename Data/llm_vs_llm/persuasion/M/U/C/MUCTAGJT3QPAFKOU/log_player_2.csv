"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'll analyze this decision using expected value.

If I buy a product:
- 80% chance it's high quality (worth $30,000 to me)
- 20% chance it's low quality (worth $0 to me)
- The price is always $10,000

Expected value = (0.8 × $30,000) + (0.2 × $0) - $10,000 = $24,000 - $10,000 = $14,000

Since the expected value is positive ($14,000), it makes sense to buy the product.

Alice's recommendation doesn't add additional information since I already know the probabilities.
