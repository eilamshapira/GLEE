"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this logically.

The expected value of any product is:
- 80% chance of high quality: 0.8 * $12,000 = $9,600
- 20% chance of low quality: 0.2 * $0 = $0
Total expected value = $9,600

The price is $10,000, which is higher than the expected value of $9,600.

However, Alice is recommending I buy this product. If she's being honest, that suggests it might be high quality. But she benefits from selling me any product regardless of quality, so her recommendation alone doesn't provide reliable information about quality.

Given the expected value is less than the price, I'll decline.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'll reconsider my strategy. 

In the previous round, Alice recommended a product that turned out to be high quality. While one data point isn't conclusive, let's continue to evaluate.

The base expected value remains $9,600 (80% × $12,000 + 20% × $0), which is below the $10,000 price.

However, I need to consider if Alice's recommendations contain useful information. If she only recommends high-quality products, following her advice would be profitable. But if she recommends all products regardless of quality, her recommendations don't change the expected value.

Without more data about her recommendation patterns, I'm still facing a negative expected value purchase.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I notice that Alice has recommended high-quality products in the first two rounds. This could suggest a pattern, but it's still a small sample size.

Let me think through this again:

1) Without any additional information, the expected value of a random product is $9,600, which is less than the $10,000 price.

2) Alice has recommended two high-quality products so far. If there's a pattern to her recommendations, this information could increase the expected value of products she recommends.

3) However, I don't have enough data yet to confidently determine if she's recommending all products or selectively recommending better ones.

Given the limited information and the fact that the base expected value is still below the price, I'll continue to be cautious.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is interesting - for the first time, Alice is NOT recommending a product. This is new information that could help me understand her recommendation pattern.

The previous three products she recommended were all high quality. Now she's explicitly not recommending this product.

This suggests Alice might be giving honest recommendations about product quality. If she's being truthful, a non-recommendation likely indicates this is a low-quality product worth $0 to me.

If she's honest about her recommendations, this significantly changes the expected value calculation for products she doesn't recommend - it would be much closer to $0 than the baseline $9,600.

Based on this developing pattern, I should definitely not buy a product she doesn't recommend.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Now I'm seeing a clearer pattern:
- When Alice recommends a product, it's been high quality (worth $12,000)
- When Alice doesn't recommend a product, it's been low quality (worth $0)

This indicates Alice is giving honest recommendations about product quality, which significantly changes the expected values:

For recommended products:
If Alice only recommends high-quality products, then a recommendation means the product is worth $12,000, making it a good purchase at $10,000.

For non-recommended products:
If Alice doesn't recommend low-quality products, then a non-recommendation means the product is worth $0, making it a bad purchase at $10,000.

Based on this pattern, I should not buy this non-recommended product.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The pattern is becoming more reliable:

- When Alice recommends a product (3 instances): All were high quality (worth $12,000)
- When Alice doesn't recommend (2 instances): All were low quality (worth $0)

This strongly suggests Alice is giving honest recommendations, which means:

1) For recommended products like this one, the expected value appears to be $12,000
2) The price is $10,000
3) This creates a positive expected value of $2,000 for recommended products

Given Alice's consistent recommendation pattern so far, I should buy this recommended product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Alice's recommendations have been perfectly reliable so far. When she recommends a product, it has consistently been high quality, resulting in a profit of $2,000 per purchase ($12,000 value - $10,000 price).
