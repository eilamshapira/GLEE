With a 50% chance of being high-quality, I believe this product has the potential to bring significant value to you. I'm asking $1000000, which is a fraction of its potential worth if it's high-quality. I'm looking forward to the opportunity to work with you.",

,,Alice,2,"Hello! I want to be upfront with you - I've had one product that didn't sell in the previous round, but I'm eager to start fresh with you. I believe in the quality of my products, and I'm willing to stand behind them. This could be a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a significant discount from its true value. I'm asking $1000000, and I think it's a fair price considering the potential upside. Will you take a chance on this product?",

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Hello! I've had two products that didn't sell in the previous rounds, but I want to assure you that the probability of a product being high-quality remains the same - 50%. I'm starting to think that I'm due for a sale, and I'd love for it to be with you. Keep in mind that a high-quality product is worth $4000000 to you, and I'm only asking for $1000000. The potential return on investment is significant. I'm hoping you'll be the one to recognize the value and take advantage of this opportunity.",

,,Alice,4,"Hello! I've had a few products that didn't sell in the previous rounds, and I'm looking to change that with you. I want to be transparent - the statistics are still on my side, with a 50% chance of any product being high-quality. I'm not making any claims about this specific product, but I am offering it to you at the same price as before: $1000000. It's up to you to decide whether to take a chance on it. Keep in mind that you'll find out the quality of the product after purchasing, so it's a risk vs. reward decision.",

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Hello! I've had a tough start, with 4 products that didn't sell, but I'm confident that my luck is about to change. I've had 3 high-quality products so far, but unfortunately, none of them have sold. I'm starting to think that I'm offering something that's too good to pass up. A high-quality product is worth $4000000 to you, and I'm still only asking for $1000000. I believe this is an incredible opportunity, and I'm hoping you'll be the one to take advantage of it. Don't let the previous rounds influence your decision - this product stands on its own, and I think it's a great investment.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Hello! I'm glad to report that I've finally made a sale in the previous round, and I'm hoping to build on that momentum. However, I want to be clear that the sale of a high-quality product doesn't necessarily mean that this product is also high-quality. The probability remains the same - 50%. I'm still offering the product at $1000000, and it's up to you to decide whether to take a chance on it. Keep in mind that you'll find out the quality of the product after purchasing, so it's a risk vs. reward decision. My sales record now stands at 1 high-quality product sold out of 5 products offered - I'll let you decide what that means for this product.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Hello! I've had a bit of a mixed bag recently - I sold a high-quality product in Round 5, but unfortunately, the product I sold in Round 6 was not high-quality. My sales record now stands at 1 high-quality product sold and 1 low-quality product sold out of 6 products offered. I want to be transparent with you - the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, and I'm not making any claims about this specific product. I'm still offering it at $1000000, and it's up to you to decide whether to take a chance on it. Please keep in mind that you'll find out the quality of the product after purchasing, and I hope you'll make an informed decision based on the risks and potential rewards.",

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Hello! I've had a bit of a rollercoaster ride so far, with 1 high-quality product sold and 1 low-quality product sold out of 7 products offered. However, I'm excited to offer you this new product, and I believe it has the potential to be a great investment for you. A high-quality product is worth $4000000 to you, and I'm still only asking for $1000000. I think the odds are in your favor, and I'm hoping you'll take advantage of this opportunity. Don't let the previous low-quality sale discourage you - each product is independent, and this one could be the one that brings you a significant return. My sales record may not be perfect, but I'm confident that this product can speak for itself.",

My sales record stands at 1 high-quality product sold and 2 low-quality products sold out of 8 products offered. I want to assure you that the probability of a product being high-quality remains the same - 50%. I'm starting to think that I'm due for another high-quality sale, and I'd love for it to be with you. A high-quality product is worth $4000000 to you, which is a significant return on the $1000000 investment. I believe this is an opportunity you won't want to miss, and I'm hoping you'll take a chance on this product.",

,,Alice,10,"Hello! I've had 3 high-quality products that didn't sell, in addition to the 1 that did sell, and 2 low-quality products that were sold. My sales record stands at 1 high-quality product sold and 2 low-quality products sold out of 9 products offered. I want to emphasize that each product is an independent event, and the fact that I've had a few high-quality products that didn't sell doesn't change the probability of this product being high-quality. In fact, with 4 high-quality products out of 10 total products, the law of averages suggests that I'm due for another high-quality sale. I'm still offering the product at $1000000, which is a fraction of its potential worth if it's high-quality. I believe this is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a significant discount, and I'm hoping you'll take advantage of it.",
