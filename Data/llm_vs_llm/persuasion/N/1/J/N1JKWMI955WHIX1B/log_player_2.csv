"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to think about this decision logically. 

Alice has an incentive to recommend products to me regardless of their quality, since she gets $100 for each sale. The fact that she recommends the product doesn't give me any additional information beyond the base probabilities.

The expected value calculation is:
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $300) = 0.8 × $300 = $240
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0) = 0.2 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $240

Since the expected value ($240) is greater than the cost ($100), it makes sense to buy.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is interesting. Alice is now not recommending the product, which could potentially signal that it's low quality. 

However, I need to be careful about reading too much into this. Since Alice gets $100 regardless of quality, she typically has an incentive to recommend all products. The fact that she's not recommending this one may suggest she knows it's low quality.

Given this new information, I should reconsider the probabilities. While the base rate is 80% high quality, Alice's non-recommendation likely indicates this particular product is low quality.
