Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes""}

Wait a minute, I see a pattern here. Alice always claims that the product is of high quality, and so far, she has been truthful. However, I need to keep in mind that there's a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product. Let's reassess my strategy.

I have been buying the product every round so far, but I need to consider the expected value of each purchase. The expected value of buying a product is:

(0.5 * $400) + (0.5 * $0) - $100 = $100

Since the expected value is greater than $0, it makes sense to continue buying the product each round. However, I should be aware that there's always a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product. I'll keep buying the product, but I'll be prepared for the possibility of receiving low-quality products in future rounds.

Final decision for this round: {""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Let's review the results so far:

* Rounds 1-4: High-quality products
* Rounds 5-6: Low-quality products
* Round 7: Alice claims it's a high-quality product

I've bought products for 7 rounds in a row, and now I've experienced getting low-quality products. I need to be more cautious. Although the expected value calculation suggests that buying is a good strategy, I should consider the possibility of prolonged bad luck.

For the upcoming rounds, I'll introduce a new rule: I'll pass on buying the product if I get two low-quality products in a row. This way, I can mitigate the risk of continued bad luck. However, for this round, I'll proceed with my initial decision."
