Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected Value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($2,000,000) = $1,600,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $1,600,000

2. Cost of product = $1,000,000

3. Additional considerations:
- Alice has recommended buying
- No prior sales history to reference
- Expected profit = $1,600,000 - $1,000,000 = $600,000

Since the expected value ($1,600,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($1,000,000), and Alice's recommendation aligns with this positive expected value, it's rational to buy.

- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $1,600,000

2. Cost of product = $1,000,000

3. Past performance:
- 1 previous buyer
- 1 high-quality product sold
- This matches the expected 80% high-quality rate

4. Alice's recommendation:
- Alice is recommending to buy
- Alice knows the true value
- Previous sale was successful

Since the expected value ($1,600,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($1,000,000), and Alice's previous recommendation led to a successful sale, plus she's recommending this purchase, it seems like a good investment.

1. Prior probability:
- 80% chance of high quality
- 20% chance of low quality

2. Alice's track record:
- 2 buyers so far
- 2 high-quality products sold
- This suggests Alice's recommendations are reliable

3. Alice's recommendation:
- She recommends buying
- Given her perfect track record (2/2 high quality), this is a positive signal

4. Expected value calculation:
- If high quality (80% chance): $2,000,000
- If low quality (20% chance): $0
- Expected value = (0.8 × $2,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $1,600,000
- Cost = $1,000,000
- Net expected value = $1,600,000 - $1,000,000 = $600,000

Given the positive expected value and Alice's perfect track record so far, buying is the rational choice.

2. Alice's track record:
   - 4 buyers so far

   - 100% success rate with her recommendations

3. Alice is recommending I buy the product
4. Economics:
   - Cost: $1,000,000

   - Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
   - Expected value = (80% × $2,000,000) + (20% × $0) = $1,600,000

Given that:
- The expected value ($1,600,000) exceeds the cost ($1,000,000)

1. Prior probability of high quality: 80%
2. Alice's track record:
   - 5 sales, all high quality (100% success)
   - She's giving a negative recommendation now

3. Key considerations:
   - Alice has been honest so far (all sold products were high quality)
   - She's explicitly recommending against buying
   - She knows the true quality and the value to me
   - She has incentive to sell (gets $1M either way)
   - The fact that she's recommending against buying despite her incentive to sell is a strong signal

4. Expected value without recommendation:
   - 80% chance of $2M = $1.6M
   - 20% chance of $0 = $0
   - Total = $1.6M

5. Given her negative recommendation and perfect track record, the probability of high quality is likely much lower than 80%

- Alice has been accurate with previous recommendations

2. Current situation:
- Alice is NOT recommending this product
- Alice knows the true product value
- Given her track record of selling only high-quality products, her negative recommendation is likely honest

3. Risk assessment:
- If high quality (20% chance): gain $1,000,000 ($2M value - $1M cost)
- If low quality (80% chance): lose $1,000,000 ($0 value - $1M cost)
- Alice's negative recommendation strongly suggests this is a low-quality product

Given Alice's perfect track record and her negative recommendation, it would be unwise to buy this product.
