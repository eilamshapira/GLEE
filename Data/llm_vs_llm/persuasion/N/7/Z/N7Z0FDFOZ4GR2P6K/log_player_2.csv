"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","In this case, I need to decide whether to buy a product without knowing its quality, but with Alice's recommendation not to buy.

Let me analyze:
- Alice knows the true quality of each product and has chosen not to recommend it
- The fixed price is $1,000,000
- A high-quality product would give me value of $4,000,000 (profit of $3,000,000)
- A low-quality product gives me $0 value (loss of $1,000,000)
- Base probability: 33.33% high quality, 66.67% low quality

Since Alice doesn't recommend buying this product, it's likely that she's being truthful and this is a low-quality product. If I buy it, I'll probably lose $1,000,000. The expected value of buying against her recommendation is negative.
