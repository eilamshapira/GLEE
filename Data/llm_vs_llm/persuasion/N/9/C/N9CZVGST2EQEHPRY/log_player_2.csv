Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. The price is $10,000
2. If high quality (33.33% chance), I get $40,000 value (+$30,000 profit)
3. If low quality (66.67% chance), I get $0 value (-$10,000 loss)
4. Expected value = (0.3333 × $30,000) + (0.6667 × -$10,000) = $10,000 - $6,667 = $3,333

While the expected value is positive, Alice's recommendation not to buy is concerning. As the seller, she knows the true quality and has no obvious incentive to discourage a sale unless the product is actually low quality.

Therefore, I'll trust Alice's recommendation.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33%): $40,000
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (33.33% × $40,000) + (66.67% × $0) = $13,332

4. Key considerations:
   - The expected value ($13,332) is higher than the price ($10,000)
   - However, Alice does not recommend buying
   - Alice has no track record yet to establish trustworthiness
   - The negative recommendation likely indicates this is a low-quality product

Given Alice's negative recommendation and considering she has direct knowledge of the product quality, I should trust her recommendation and avoid the purchase.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Cost of product: $10,000
2. If high quality (33.33% chance): Worth $40,000 (profit of $30,000)
3. If low quality (66.67% chance): Worth $0 (loss of $10,000)

Expected value calculation:
- (33.33% × $30,000) + (66.67% × -$10,000)
- $10,000 - $6,667 = $3,333

Even though there's no previous sales history to go by, the expected value is positive ($3,333), making this a mathematically favorable bet. Alice's recommendation provides some additional confidence.

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality: $40,000 (33.33% chance)
   - Low quality: $0 (66.67% chance)
3. Current statistics:
   - 1 previous buyer
   - 1 high-quality product sold
   - Alice does NOT recommend this product

Given that:
- Alice has sold only high-quality products so far (1/1)
- Alice is NOT recommending this product
- The seller's negative recommendation likely indicates this is a low-quality product
- The base probability of a low-quality product is already high (66.67%)

The combination of the base probability and the negative recommendation strongly suggests this is a low-quality product, which would be worth $0. Therefore, paying $10,000 would result in a loss.

4. Current situation:

   - Given her track record of honesty and her negative recommendation, this strongly suggests the product is low quality

Given that Alice has shown honesty in previous sales and is explicitly recommending against purchase, plus the fact that there's already a higher-than-base-rate proportion of high-quality products sold (1/1 vs expected 33.33%), this product is very likely low quality.

The fact that Alice has sold 1 high-quality product and is now recommending against buying suggests that this current product is likely low quality.

If the product is low quality (which is more likely given Alice's recommendation), I would lose $10,000.

- If low quality, I would lose $10,000

The fact that Alice's previous recommendation resulted in a high-quality sale is a positive signal. While the base probability of getting a high-quality product is 33.33%, Alice's track record (though limited) and current recommendation make it more likely that this is a high-quality product.

Expected value calculation:
If we assume Alice's recommendation is reliable based on past performance:
- Chance of high quality (when recommended): Higher than 33.33%
- If high quality: Profit = $40,000 - $10,000 = $30,000

4. Alice has recommended buying this product

The historical data shows that when Alice recommends a product, it has been high quality 100% of the time (2 out of 2). While this is a small sample size, it's a strong positive signal. Since Alice is recommending this product, and her track record is perfect so far, this suggests the product is likely high quality.

If it's high quality, the profit would be $30,000 ($40,000 - $10,000).
If it's low quality, the loss would be $10,000.
