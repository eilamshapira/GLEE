Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Before making a recommendation, let's consider the current statistics:

- Total products sold: 10
- High-quality products sold: 10
- Low-quality products sold: 0

Given that the buyer knows the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and seeing that all products sold so far have been high-quality, the buyer might be increasingly confident in the quality of the products. However, it's crucial to maintain the buyer's trust by continuing to be honest about the product quality.
