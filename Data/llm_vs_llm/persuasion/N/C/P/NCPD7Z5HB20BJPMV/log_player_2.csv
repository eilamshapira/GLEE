Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No prior information:** There are no prior sales data, so we only have Alice's recommendation and the product's inherent 80% chance of being high-quality.
* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice recommending the product carries some weight. While she doesn't know the exact value to you, she's likely trying to make a sale. This suggests she might have some insider knowledge or believes the product is likely good.
* **Expected value:** The expected value of buying is 0.8 * $125 + 0.2 * $0 = $100. This is exactly the price, meaning there's no inherent loss in buying.

**Overall, the lack of negative information and Alice's recommendation make it worthwhile to take a chance on the product.**"
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who has more information about the product's quality, is not recommending it. This is a strong signal that it's likely a low-quality product.
* **Limited Data:**  We only have one data point from the previous buyer.  This is not enough to overcome the information from Alice's recommendation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even though there's a chance the product is high quality, the potential loss ($100) if it's low quality outweighs the potential gain ($25).

**It's better to be cautious and pass on this product.**"

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is recommended by Alice and the previous buyer purchased a high-quality product, it's likely this product is also high quality.  Even with the 20% chance of it being low quality, the potential reward of $125 outweighs the risk of getting a $0 product."

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, despite having no information about the current product's quality, is recommending against buying it. This suggests she has some insight that we don't. It's possible she's seen a trend of low-quality products being offered lately.
* **Previous Sales:**  The sales history shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products. However, this is based on a very small sample size (only 2). It's not enough to guarantee the current product is high-quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of $125 is attractive, but the risk of getting a worthless product is significant. Since Alice is recommending against buying, and the sample size is small, it's better to play it safe and pass."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong indicator. Since all 3 previous buyers who bought the product received high-quality items, Alice's recommendation against buying suggests the current product is likely low quality.  While there's always a chance it could be high quality, the risk is too high based on the available information."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Signal:**  Alice has recommended the product, and all previous recommendations have resulted in high-quality products. This is a very strong signal that the current product is also likely to be high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $125 outweighs the risk of losing $100. 

Since the likelihood of getting a high-quality product is high, and the potential payoff is significant, it makes sense to buy the product."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The information provided suggests a very strong likelihood that the current product is of high quality.  Here's why:

* **Perfect Track Record:** All 6 products sold so far have been high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation suggests she believes the product is worth buying. This could be based on her knowledge of the product's quality, or a strategy to maximize sales.

While there's still a 20% chance of it being low quality, the potential reward of $125 far outweighs the risk of losing $100."

Alice's recommendation and the sales record strongly suggest that the product is high-quality.  

* **100% success rate:** All 12 products sold have been high-quality. This is a very strong signal.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Since Alice knows the product's true quality, her recommendation carries significant weight. 

Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the high probability of getting a high-quality product ($125 value) makes it a worthwhile risk."
