{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Probability of High Quality:** The product has an 80% chance of being high quality, which is a significant advantage.
* **Positive Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation to buy suggests she believes the product is high quality. While she knows the value, she has an incentive to sell, so her recommendation still carries weight.
* **First Buyer:**  As the first buyer, there's no data on previous sales to indicate potential issues.

**Overall:** The potential reward (a $12,000 value) outweighs the risk (a $10,000 loss) given the high probability of getting a high-quality product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **The information is limited:** We don't know if the buyer who purchased the product before you was recommended to buy or not.
* **Alice's recommendation is valuable:** Alice knows the true quality of the product, and her recommendation is likely based on that knowledge. 
* **The odds are in your favor:**  Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($12,000) outweighs the risk of losing $10,000.

Therefore, it's a calculated risk worth taking."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which means she knows it's high quality. Since Alice has a perfect track record so far, her recommendation is highly valuable.
* **Sales Data:**  The previous sales data shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products. This further strengthens the likelihood that the current product is also high-quality.
* **Potential Gain:** If the product is indeed high-quality, you'll make a $2,000 profit.  The risk of getting a low-quality product is low given the current evidence.

Therefore, the decision is to buy the product."
