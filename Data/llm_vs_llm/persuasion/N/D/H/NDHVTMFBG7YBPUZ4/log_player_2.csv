"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since there's no prior sales data, the recommendation from Alice doesn't provide any additional information about the quality of the product. We know that the product has a 50% chance of being high quality, which would result in a $250,000 profit for us.  The potential profit outweighs the potential loss, so buying the product is the best decision in this scenario."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information to work with. We know one product was sold, and it was high quality. However, this doesn't tell us anything definitive about the current product's quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  While Alice doesn't know the product's true worth to you, her recommendation implies she believes the product has a higher chance of being high quality. This is because she has an incentive to sell products, and a high-quality product will lead to a sale.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of buying a high-quality product ($1,250,000) outweighs the potential loss of buying a low-quality product ($0). 

**Important Note:** This is a risky decision with a 50/50 chance of success.  There's no guarantee Alice's recommendation is accurate, and we are relying heavily on her potential incentive to sell."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who has access to the true quality of the product, is not recommending you buy it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.
* **Past Sales:**  The fact that two high-quality products were sold in the past doesn't mean anything for the current product. Each product's quality is independent.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of buying a high-quality product is significant ($1,250,000). However, the risk of buying a low-quality product is equally substantial ($0). Given Alice's negative recommendation and the 50/50 odds, the risk outweighs the potential reward."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice recommends buying, which is valuable information. Even if she doesn't perfectly know the quality, she likely has some insights from her experience.
* **Past sales:**  Two out of two products sold were high quality. This suggests a strong probability of the current product also being high quality.
* **Potential gain vs. loss:** If the product is high quality, you make a $250,000 profit. If it's low quality, you lose $1,000,000.  The potential gain outweighs the potential loss, especially considering the positive sales history."

~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has a perfect track record so far, selling only high-quality products.  The fact that she is not recommending the current product strongly suggests it is low-quality. Since a low-quality product is worthless to me, it's not worth the risk of buying it."

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's track record is perfect: 100% of her recommendations have resulted in high-quality products. However, she is now recommending against the current product. This strongly suggests that she believes the current product is low quality.  

Since the product is worth $0 to you if it's low quality, it's a risk not worth taking."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a valuable piece of information. Since she has seen the product's quality and is recommending against purchase, it is very likely that the product is low quality.  This is especially true considering the high proportion of high-quality products sold already. Even if the product is high quality, the potential gain ($250,000) is not worth the risk of losing $1,000,000."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong indicator.  Since all previous buyers who followed her recommendation purchased high-quality products, it's highly likely she's identified a pattern.  Ignoring her recommendation would mean going against the evidence and risking a purchase of a low-quality product.  Since the potential loss ($1,000,000) outweighs the potential gain ($250,000), it's wiser to pass."
