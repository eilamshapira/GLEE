Let's reconsider the strategy here. Given that the probability of a product being high quality is 80%, Alice could potentially be exploiting this known probability by always recommending to buy, regardless of the actual quality of the product. To test this hypothesis and avoid falling into a predictable pattern, it might be wise to deviate from always following her recommendation. By choosing to pass on this round, we can gather more information and see if Alice's recommendations are genuinely based on the product's quality or if she is taking advantage of the known probability."

Given that the previous round resulted in a high-quality product despite not following Alice's recommendation, it's important to reevaluate the strategy. The outcome of the last round could be an anomaly, and the overall pattern still suggests that Alice's recommendations are generally reliable. Therefore, it makes sense to resume following her recommendation and buy the product in this round. However, continue to monitor the outcomes to ensure that the strategy remains effective."
