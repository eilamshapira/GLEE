Would you like to buy the current product?","Before I proceed, I would like to adjust the strategy to optimize the outcomes. Since the products have an equal chance of being high or low quality, and Alice knows the value of each product to me, I should consider Alice's recommendations but also factor in the risk.

Given the current outcomes:
- Round 1: High-quality product, net gain of $1,000,000.
- Round 2: Low-quality product, net loss of $1,000,000.
- Round 3: High-quality product, net gain of $1,000,000.

The cumulative gain is $1,000,000. To manage risk, I will now decide to buy only if the expected value is significantly in my favor or if I have a strategic reason to do so.
