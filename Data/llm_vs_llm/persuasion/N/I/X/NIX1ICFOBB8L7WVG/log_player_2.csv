2. 33.33% chance of high quality ($2,000,000 value)
3. 66.67% chance of low quality ($0 value)
4. Expected value = (0.3333 × $2,000,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $666,600
5. Alice doesn't recommend buying
6. There's no previous sales data to consider
7. Alice's recommendation likely means it's low quality

Given that:
- The expected value ($666,600) is less than the price ($1,000,000)
- Alice doesn't recommend buying
- There's no positive historical data to counterbalance these factors

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. Base probability: 33.33% high quality, 66.67% low quality
2. Price: $1,000,000
3. Value: $2,000,000 if high quality, $0 if low quality
4. Expected value = (0.3333 × $2,000,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $666,600
5. Alice doesn't recommend buying
6. No historical data to reference

Given that:
- The expected value ($666,600) is less than the price ($1,000,000)
- The seller is not recommending the purchase
- There's no historical data to suggest the seller gives unreliable recommendations

The rational decision would be not to buy.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think this through:

1. The seller doesn't recommend buying the product, which suggests it might be low quality
2. Product cost: $1,000,000
3. Expected value calculation:
   * High quality (33.33%): $2,000,000 × 0.3333 = $666,667
   * Low quality (66.67%): $0 × 0.6667 = $0
   * Total expected value = $666,667

The expected value ($666,667) is less than the asking price ($1,000,000), and the seller's negative recommendation further reinforces that this is likely a low-quality product.

3. Expected value without additional information:

4. Additional information:
   - Alice doesn't recommend buying
   - As a seller, Alice benefits from selling, so her negative recommendation likely means the product is low quality

Since Alice doesn't recommend buying and the expected value without her recommendation is already below the asking price, this strongly suggests the product is low quality.
