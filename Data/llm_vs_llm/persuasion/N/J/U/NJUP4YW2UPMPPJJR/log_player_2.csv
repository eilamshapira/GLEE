"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the information:

1. Alice has sold 2 products, both of which were high-quality.
2. Alice is recommending this current product to you.

Given this record, it appears that Alice has only recommended high-quality products for purchase so far. The recommendation and past sales history provide a strong indication of high quality.

Based on the 80% probability leading to high quality and the seller's past performance (100% recommendation has led to high-quality buys), it makes sense to purchase the product as the expected value (EV) calculation is favorable:

- EV of buying = 0.80 * $1,250,000 + 0.20 * $0 - $1,000,000 = $1,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $0 (but with full history of 100% HQ sales, EV is $250,000 positive)

Therefore, I would recommend purchasing the product based on these circumstances.

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make an informed decision, we need to consider the following factors:

- The product's probability of being high quality (80%) if we rely on general odds.
- Alice has a perfect record so far (6 high-quality products sold out of 6 buyers), suggesting her recommendations have been reliable.

Given this, Alice's recommendation holds considerable weight due to her perfect track record. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume the current product is also high quality.

Given these considerations, here is my decision:
