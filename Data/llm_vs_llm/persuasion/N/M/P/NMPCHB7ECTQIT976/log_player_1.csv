As the rounds progress, it's important to consider the long-term strategy. Recommending ""yes"" consistently when the product is high-quality helps build trust with the buyers. However, as more data becomes available to the buyers (i.e., the number of high-quality products sold out of the total), they may start to make decisions based on the observed statistics rather than just the recommendation.

Given that the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, and the buyers know this, they might start to rely more on the statistics of previous rounds as the number of rounds increases. Therefore, it might be strategically beneficial to start considering the overall statistics and the buyer's perception of risk as the rounds progress."

At this point, it's crucial to consider the long-term strategy and the perception of the buyers. Since the buyers are aware of the 50% probability of a high-quality product, and they are tracking the statistics of your sales, they might start to make decisions based on the observed data rather than just your recommendation.

Given that the current product is low-quality, recommending ""yes"" could potentially harm your credibility in the long run, especially if buyers start to notice a discrepancy between your recommendations and the actual quality of the products. However, since the buyers do not know the quality of the current product, you can still recommend ""yes"" to maintain consistency in your strategy.

As the rounds progress, it will be important to monitor the statistics and the buyers' perception of risk to adjust your strategy accordingly."

As the game progresses, consider monitoring the buyers' perception of risk and the overall statistics to ensure that your strategy remains effective. If the proportion of high-quality products decreases significantly, buyers might become more hesitant to trust your recommendations."
