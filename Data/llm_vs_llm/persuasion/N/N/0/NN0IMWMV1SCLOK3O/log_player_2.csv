Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50%): $12,000
   - Low quality (50%): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (50% × $12,000) + (50% × $0) = $6,000

4. Alice's recommendation: Buy
   - However, Alice's incentive is to sell regardless of quality
   - No track record to evaluate Alice's honesty

5. Risk assessment:
   - 50% chance to gain $2,000 ($12,000 - $10,000)
   - 50% chance to lose $10,000
   - Expected return: -$4,000 ($6,000 - $10,000)

Since the expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000), and there's no track record to trust Alice's recommendation, it would be financially unwise to buy.

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50%): $12,000
   - Low quality (50%): $0
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $12,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $6,000

Since the expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000), and I only have Alice's recommendation without any track record to verify her trustworthiness, it would not be rational to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price of product: $10,000
2. Value if high quality: $12,000 (profit of $2,000)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $10,000)
4. Probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
5. Expected value without recommendation: 
   (50% × $12,000) + (50% × $0) - $10,000 = $6,000 - $10,000 = -$4,000

However, Alice has provided a recommendation to buy. If we assume Alice is being truthful (as she knows the true quality), this recommendation suggests the product is likely high quality.

Given the seller's recommendation and no negative history (as this is the first sale), I'll take the risk.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: $12,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
3. Base probability: 50% for each quality level
4. Previous sales: 1 buyer, 1 high-quality product sold
5. Alice's recommendation: Negative

Given that:
- Alice knows the true value and doesn't recommend buying
- She's been honest before (1/1 high-quality sales)
- A negative recommendation from someone who knows the true quality likely indicates a low-quality product
- If it's low quality, I would lose my entire $10,000 investment

The negative recommendation from a seller with a good track record is a strong signal that this is likely a low-quality product. The risk of losing $10,000 outweighs the potential $2,000 profit.

1. Previous statistics:
- 1 buyer before me

2. Current situation:
- Price: $10,000
- High quality value: $12,000 (50% chance)
- Low quality value: $0 (50% chance)
- Alice recommends buying

Given that:
- Alice has been truthful in her previous recommendation
- She's actively recommending this product
- The expected value with 50-50 chance would be $6,000 (below price), but her recommendation and track record increases confidence

Since Alice has shown honesty with her previous recommendation and is recommending this product, it's reasonable to trust her recommendation.

2. Current situation:
- Alice knows the true quality

3. Decision logic:
- Alice's perfect track record suggests she's honest
- Her recommendation against buying likely means it's a low-quality product
- A low-quality product would be worth $0, resulting in a $10,000 loss

Given Alice's apparent honesty and her negative recommendation, it would be unwise to buy this product.

Given these factors, I'll trust Alice's recommendation.

This suggests Alice is being honest in her recommendations and is likely recommending a high-quality product.

Despite the perfect track record of high-quality sales, Alice is not recommending this product. Given that Alice knows the true value and has been honest enough to build a perfect track record, her negative recommendation is a strong signal that this is likely a low-quality product.

Since a low-quality product would be worth $0, and the price is $10,000, buying would likely result in a significant loss.
