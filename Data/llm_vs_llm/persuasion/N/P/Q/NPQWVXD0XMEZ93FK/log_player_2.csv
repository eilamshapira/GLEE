{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong indicator. Since no products have been sold yet, there's no historical data to suggest she's recommending based on anything other than the product's actual quality. Her recommendation against buying suggests the product is likely low quality, which is worth $0 to me.  It's not worth the risk."

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since there's no previous sales data to go by, we have to rely on Alice's recommendation. As Alice does not recommend buying the product, it's highly likely the product is low quality (since she knows the true value to us).  The risk of buying a low-quality product and losing $100 is too high, so it's better to pass."
"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong indicator.  Since no products have been sold yet, there's no historical data to rely on.  Alice, knowing the product's quality, is explicitly advising against buying.  Given the high probability of a low-quality product (66.67%) and the risk of getting a worthless item, it's best to pass."
"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since there is no prior sales data, the recommendation from Alice is the only information available.  As a rational buyer, I should trust Alice's recommendation. Given the potential value of a high-quality product ($200) and the potential loss of a low-quality product ($0), the recommendation makes it worthwhile to take the risk."

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. She knows the quality of the product and has a strong incentive to sell high-quality products to maximize her profit. Since she doesn't recommend buying, it strongly suggests the product is low quality.  Even though the previous sales record is positive, the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product outweighs the positive past data."

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, who knows the product's quality, is not recommending the purchase. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low-quality.
* **Past Sales Data:**  2 out of 2 products sold were high quality. This is an extremely high success rate, suggesting that Alice has been recommending only the good products. Since she's not recommending this one, it's likely bad.

While there's always a chance the product is high quality, the odds are heavily against it.  It's not worth the risk of losing $100."

Here's why:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, who knows the product's quality, is not recommending the purchase. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.
* **Past data:**  All previous buyers who accepted Alice's recommendations ended up with high-quality products. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are accurate and reliable.

Given the information, it's highly probable that the current product is low quality.  Therefore, passing on the product is the rational decision."

Here's why:

* **Alice's Expertise:** Alice knows the true value of each product. Her recommendation against buying is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.
* **Statistics:** 100% of the products recommended by Alice have been high quality. This reinforces the trust in her judgment. 
* **Risk/Reward:**  A low-quality product yields no value. Buying a product that Alice doesn't recommend carries a high risk with no potential for reward.

It's better to pass and wait for a product that Alice recommends."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice knows the value of the product to you, and she recommends buying it, this strongly suggests the product is high quality. With a 100% success rate of high-quality products being sold so far, it's highly likely that the current product is also high quality.  Therefore, the risk is low, and the potential reward of $200 is worth the $100 investment."

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since she knows the true value of each product, her recommendation not to buy indicates a high probability of the product being low quality. Even though the sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products, this is based on a small sample size. It's more likely that Alice is being truthful about the current product's quality. Therefore, it's best to pass on the offer."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since all 5 previous buyers who purchased the product received a high-quality product, it's highly likely that Alice is recommending a high-quality product to you.  The recommendation alone, coupled with the perfect sales record, provides strong evidence that this product is worth the risk."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 6 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 6 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 7th buyer!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who knows the product's quality, is not recommending the purchase. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.
* **Sales Record:**  All 6 previous buyers who purchased based on Alice's recommendation received high-quality products. This suggests that Alice is reliable in her recommendations. 

Considering both factors, it's highly likely that the product is low quality, making it unwise to buy."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:** Alice has a 100% success rate in recommending high-quality products. 
* **High Value:**  A high-quality product is worth $200 to you, which is double the price. Even if it's low quality, you lose only $100, which is less than the potential gain.
* **Limited Information:** While the probability of a low-quality product is higher, the seller's perfect track record provides strong evidence that the current product is likely high quality. 

**Therefore, based on the available information, buying the product is the best strategy.**"
