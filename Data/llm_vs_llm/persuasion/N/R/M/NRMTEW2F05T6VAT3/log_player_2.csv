"Round 1
Alice's message: I have an exceptional product available for you today, well worth the investment of $1000000. It is of high quality, and I can confidently say that it will exceed your expectations and provide significant value. Don't miss this opportunity!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to decide if buying makes sense given the information. 

Each product has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $2M to me) and 20% chance of low quality (worth $0). Alice is trying to sell me a product for $1M and claims it's high quality.

The expected value calculation is:
- If high quality (80% chance): $2M - $1M = $1M profit
- If low quality (20% chance): $0 - $1M = -$1M loss
- Expected value: (0.8 × $1M) + (0.2 × -$1M) = $0.8M - $0.2M = $0.6M

Since the expected value is positive, it makes sense to buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is interesting - Alice's message has changed. For the first time, she's indicating that this product is ""not the highest quality"" rather than explicitly stating it's high quality like in previous rounds.

If Alice is being truthful, this suggests the current product is low quality. If the product is low quality, it's worth $0 to me, and buying it for $1M would result in a $1M loss.

Although the base probability is 80% high quality and 20% low quality, Alice's specific messaging about this product being ""not the highest quality"" is a strong signal that overrides the general probability.
