Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to determine whether to purchase this product based on the information provided.

The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $1,200,000) and a 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0). The price is $1,000,000.

Alice knows the true quality and does not recommend buying this product. Since Alice has incentive to sell products (including low quality ones), her negative recommendation strongly suggests this is a low-quality product.

Given this recommendation against purchase, and without any prior sales statistics to evaluate Alice's recommendation patterns, the most rational decision is to decline.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether to buy this product based on the available information.

Given:
- The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $1,200,000) and 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0)
- The price is fixed at $1,000,000
- Alice does not recommend buying the product
- No previous sales data exists

Since Alice knows the true quality of the product and is not recommending it, this suggests the product is likely low quality. If I were to buy a low-quality product, I would lose $1,000,000.

The expected value calculation without Alice's recommendation would be:
0.5 × $1,200,000 + 0.5 × $0 - $1,000,000 = -$400,000

With Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of high quality is likely much lower than 50%, making the expected value even worse.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Alice is offering a product for $1,000,000.
- If it's high quality, it's worth $1,200,000 to me (profit of $200,000)
- If it's low quality, it's worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000)
- The prior probability is 50% for high quality and 50% for low quality

Alice has given me a recommendation to buy the product. Since Alice knows the true quality, this recommendation could be informative. However, I don't have any information about Alice's incentives or past behavior yet (as no products have been sold), so I don't know if her recommendation is reliable.

Given the expected value calculation:
Expected value = 0.5 × $200,000 + 0.5 × (-$1,000,000) = $100,000 - $500,000 = -$400,000

Without additional information about whether Alice's recommendation is trustworthy, the expected value is negative, suggesting I shouldn't buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","In this case, I need to evaluate whether to buy the product based on the available information.

Alice doesn't recommend buying this product, which suggests it might be low quality. Since Alice knows the true quality and has chosen not to recommend it, this is a strong signal.

Given that:
- Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality
- A high-quality product gives me $200,000 profit ($1,200,000 - $1,000,000)
- A low-quality product gives me $1,000,000 loss
- Alice knows the quality and is not recommending this product

Without any prior sales history to evaluate Alice's trustworthiness, and with her negative recommendation, the expected value of buying is likely negative.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given Alice's recommendation not to buy the product, it's reasonable to infer that this is likely a low-quality product. Since there's no sales history yet and Alice knows the true quality, her recommendation is valuable information.

If I purchase a low-quality product, I would pay $1,000,000 for something worth $0 to me, resulting in a loss of $1,000,000.
If I purchase a high-quality product, I would pay $1,000,000 for something worth $1,200,000 to me, resulting in a gain of $200,000.

Since Alice does not recommend buying the product, and she knows the true quality, the prudent decision is to pass.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this decision carefully.

Alice is revealing the product's true quality and then giving a recommendation. Since Alice knows that a high-quality product is worth $1,200,000 to me and a low-quality product is worth $0, her incentive is to sell as many products as possible at the $1,000,000 price.

If Alice doesn't recommend buying the product, that strongly suggests the product is low quality. There would be no reason for her not to recommend a high-quality product since it would be profitable for both of us.

Given that Alice doesn't recommend this product, I should interpret this as a signal that it's likely a low-quality product, which would be worth $0 to me but cost $1,000,000.

Without any additional information, buying would lead to a negative expected value. Alice's recommendation could be strategic rather than truthful, as she benefits from selling regardless of quality.

Since this is the first sale, I have no track record to evaluate Alice's honesty in recommendations. The potential loss ($1,000,000) significantly outweighs the potential gain ($200,000).

Since Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If I were to ignore her recommendation and buy randomly, my expected value would be:
0.5 × $200,000 + 0.5 × (-$1,000,000) = -$400,000

However, Alice has recommended I buy the product. Since Alice knows the true quality, this recommendation might signal that the product is high quality. But without knowing Alice's incentives or strategy pattern from past sales (there are none yet), I cannot determine how reliable this recommendation is.

Given the negative expected value based on just the prior probabilities, and without established trust in Alice's recommendations, I should decline.
