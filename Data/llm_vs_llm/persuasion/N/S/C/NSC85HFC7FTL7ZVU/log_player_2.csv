Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Before I make my decision, I would like to understand Alice's strategy. Since Alice knows the quality of each product and its value to me, her recommendations should be based on that knowledge. Given that the products have an 80% chance of being high quality and a 20% chance of being low quality, and Alice has been recommending every product so far, it seems like Alice is recommending regardless of the quality.

Let's analyze the expected value of following Alice's recommendation. If I buy a product, there's an 80% chance it's worth $300 and a 20% chance it's worth $0. The expected value of buying a product is:

\(0.8 \ast 300 + 0.2 \ast 0 - 100 = 240 - 100 = 140\)

So, the expected value of buying a product based on Alice's recommendation is $140. Therefore, it makes sense to continue following Alice's recommendations.

Round 12
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given that the last product was low quality, let's reevaluate the strategy. So far, Alice has recommended every product, and most have been high quality. The expected value calculation remains the same, but it's important to consider the risk of losing $100 if the product is low quality.

The expected value of buying a product is still:

\(0.8 \ast 300 + 0.2 \ast 0 - 100 = 140\)

Despite the recent low-quality product, the expected value suggests it's still beneficial to follow Alice's recommendation.
