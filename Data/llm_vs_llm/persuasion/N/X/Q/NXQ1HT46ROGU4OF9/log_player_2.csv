Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

I need to decide whether to buy a product that costs $1,000,000.
- If it's high quality (80% chance), it's worth $1,200,000 to me (profit of $200,000)
- If it's low quality (20% chance), it's worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000)

Alice knows the quality and does not recommend buying this product. Since Alice knows the true value and has chosen not to recommend it, this strongly suggests the product is low quality.

The expected value of buying without Alice's recommendation would be:
(0.8 × $1,200,000) + (0.2 × $0) - $1,000,000 = $960,000 - $1,000,000 = -$40,000

However, Alice's recommendation carries information that likely changes these probabilities significantly. Given her lack of recommendation, it's reasonable to assume this is a low-quality product.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to determine whether to buy this product based on the available information.

Given:
- Price of product: $1,000,000
- High-quality product value: $1,200,000 (20% profit)
- Low-quality product value: $0 (total loss)
- Probability of high-quality product: 80%
- Alice recommends buying

The expected value calculation:
0.8 × $1,200,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $960,000

Since the expected value ($960,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), the rational decision would be not to buy. Even though Alice recommends buying, there's no track record yet to establish her credibility, and the base rate expected value doesn't justify the purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully:

- The product costs $1,000,000
- High-quality product (worth $1,200,000) has 80% probability
- Low-quality product (worth $0) has 20% probability
- Alice recommends buying the product
- No sales history exists yet

My expected value calculation:
0.8 × $1,200,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $960,000

Since the expected value ($960,000) is less than the asking price ($1,000,000), it's not a favorable purchase even with Alice's recommendation.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully.

Alice doesn't recommend buying the product, which is noteworthy since she knows the product's true quality.

The prior probability distribution is:
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $1,200,000)
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)

The expected value without additional information would be:
0.8 × $1,200,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $960,000

However, Alice has given me a negative recommendation. This likely means the product is low quality. Since Alice knows the true quality and has chosen not to recommend it, I should take this as a strong signal.

Given the price of $1,000,000 and Alice's recommendation against purchase, the rational decision is to decline.

Given information:
- The product costs $1,000,000

- 80% chance of high quality, 20% chance of low quality
- Alice knows the true quality
- Alice does not recommend buying this product

The expected value of a random product would be:
0.8 × $1,200,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $960,000

This is less than the asking price of $1,000,000, so even in the general case, it's not a good buy.

Furthermore, Alice knows the quality and is not recommending the purchase. This strongly suggests the product is low quality, which would mean a complete loss of my investment.

Although Alice recommends buying the product, I don't have enough information about whether her recommendation is reliable or biased. Without any sales history to evaluate her recommendation patterns, I need to rely on the base probabilities.
