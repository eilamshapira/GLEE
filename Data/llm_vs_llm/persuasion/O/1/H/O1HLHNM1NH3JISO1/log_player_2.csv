Would you like to proceed with acquiring this premium item?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Before making a decision, let's calculate the expected value of buying a product.

The expected value (EV) of buying a product is:

EV = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality) - Price
EV = (0.8 * $20,000) + (0.2 * $0) - $10,000
EV = $16,000 + $0 - $10,000
EV = $6,000

Since the expected value of buying a product is positive, it makes sense to continue buying.
