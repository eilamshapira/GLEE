Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this offer carefully:

- Price: $10,000
- Potential value: $12,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
- Expected value: 0.5 × $12,000 + 0.5 × $0 = $6,000

Since the expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000), purchasing would lead to an expected loss of $4,000.

Alice recommends buying, but since there's no track record of previous sales, I have no evidence that her recommendations align with product quality. Her recommendation alone isn't sufficient to overcome the negative expected value.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze if buying this product is a good decision based on the expected value.

Facts:
- Product price: $10,000
- High-quality value: $12,000 (50% chance)
- Low-quality value: $0 (50% chance)
- Alice recommends buying the product
- No previous sales history to establish Alice's recommendation credibility

Expected value calculation:
0.5 × $12,000 + 0.5 × $0 = $6,000

Since the expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000), and there's no previous sales data to assess if Alice's recommendations are reliable, buying would be a negative expected value decision.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Since Alice doesn't recommend buying the product and there's no prior sales record to evaluate her trustworthiness, this suggests the product might be low quality.

If the product is high quality ($12,000 value), I'd gain $2,000 by purchasing at $10,000.
If the product is low quality ($0 value), I'd lose $10,000.

With a 50% chance of each outcome and Alice explicitly recommending against purchase, the expected value appears negative.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendation against buying suggests the product is likely of low quality. If I buy, I'll pay $10,000 for a product that has a 50% chance of being worth $12,000 (high quality) and a 50% chance of being worth $0 (low quality). Given Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of low quality is likely higher than 50%.

The expected value would be less than $6,000 (0.5 × $12,000), which is below the $10,000 price, making this a poor decision economically.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information provided, I need to make a decision about whether to purchase this product or not.

Alice does not recommend buying the product, which suggests she believes it may be low quality. Since Alice has revealed the true quality of the product to herself (as per the game rules), her recommendation likely reflects this knowledge.

There's no prior sales record to analyze since I would be the first buyer. Without any historical data on Alice's recommendation patterns, I should take her recommendation at face value.

If the product is low quality (worth $0 to me) and I pay $10,000, I would lose $10,000. If it's high quality (worth $12,000 to me) and I pay $10,000, I would gain $2,000.

Since Alice explicitly recommends against buying the product, and she knows its true quality, the rational decision is to follow her advice.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Alice recommends that I buy the product, but I have no prior history of her recommendations to judge her trustworthiness. 

The expected value calculation is straightforward:
- 50% chance of high quality: 0.5 × $12,000 = $6,000
- 50% chance of low quality: 0.5 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value: $6,000

Since the price is $10,000 and the expected value is only $6,000, the rational decision is not to buy.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Alice has selected a product for me and is recommending that I buy it. Since no products have been sold yet, I don't have any track record to evaluate Alice's trustworthiness.

The product costs $10,000.
- If it's high quality (50% chance), it's worth $12,000 to me (profit of $2,000)
- If it's low quality (50% chance), it's worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)

Expected value calculation:
0.5 × $2,000 + 0.5 × (-$10,000) = $1,000 - $5,000 = -$4,000

The expected value is negative, which means on average I would lose money on this purchase, regardless of Alice's recommendation.

Alice doesn't recommend buying this product, which suggests it might be low quality. Since no products have been sold yet, I don't have any historical data to judge Alice's recommendation credibility.

- If high quality (50% chance): $12,000
- If low quality (50% chance): $0
- Expected value: 0.5 × $12,000 + 0.5 × $0 = $6,000

The product costs $10,000, but its expected value is only $6,000. Given Alice's negative recommendation, which likely indicates this specific product is low quality, I should decline.

Given information:

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided:

1. The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $12,000) and 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0).
2. The price is fixed at $10,000.
3. Alice does not recommend buying the product.
4. There's no prior sales history to establish Alice's recommendation reliability.

Given that Alice is not recommending the purchase and there's no way to evaluate the credibility of her recommendation, it would be risky to buy the product. The expected value without additional information would be $6,000 (0.5 × $12,000), which is less than the $10,000 price.

Alice does not recommend buying the product, which suggests it may be low quality. Given that:
- Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality
- A high-quality product is worth $12,000 to me (profit of $2,000)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- Alice knows the true quality and is giving me a recommendation
- There's no prior sales history to evaluate Alice's trustworthiness

Since Alice has no incentive to lie (she gets $10,000 regardless of quality), her recommendation not to buy likely means the product is low quality. If I buy against her recommendation, I would likely lose $10,000.

The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $12,000 to me) and a 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me).

Alice has randomly selected a product for me and does not recommend buying it. This is a signal that it might be low quality. While Alice's interests don't necessarily align with mine, the fact that she specifically does not recommend the purchase is concerning.

The expected value calculation without the recommendation would be:
