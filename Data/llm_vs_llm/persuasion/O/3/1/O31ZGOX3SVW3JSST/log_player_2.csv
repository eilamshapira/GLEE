Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33%): $1,200,000
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0

Expected value = (0.3333 × $1,200,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $400,000

Even with Alice's recommendation, the expected value ($400,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), and there's no previous sales history to establish trust in Alice's recommendations.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Expected value calculation:
   * 33.33% chance of high quality ($1,200,000) = $400,000
   * 66.67% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
   * Total expected value = $400,000

3. The expected value ($400,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000)

4. Even though Alice recommends buying, since she knows the true quality, there's no track record to establish her trustworthiness yet.

5. Without any historical data about Alice's honesty in recommendations, it's too risky to trust the recommendation alone when the basic probability makes this a losing proposition.

2. The cost is $1,000,000

3. Considerations:
- Expected value ($400,000) < Cost ($1,000,000)
- No historical data to evaluate Alice's trustworthiness
- Alice's recommendation could be biased as she wants to make a sale
- High risk of loss given the probability distribution

Given that the expected value is less than the cost and there's no track record to trust Alice's recommendation, it would be financially unwise to make the purchase.

Even with Alice's recommendation, the expected value is negative. Without any track record of Alice's honesty in recommendations, it's too risky to trust just the recommendation alone given the high stakes and negative expected value.
