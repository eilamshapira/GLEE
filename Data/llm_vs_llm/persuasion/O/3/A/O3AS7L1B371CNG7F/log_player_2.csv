**Reasoning:**

* **No prior information:** There's no data on past sales to inform the decision.
* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice, knowing the product's quality, recommends buying it.  This is a strong signal in favor of the product being high quality.
* **Potential upside:** Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($125 value) outweighs the risk of losing $100. 

While there's a risk, the potential reward and Alice's recommendation make buying the product the more logical choice in this situation."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice knows the quality of the product and recommends buying it. This is strong information. 
* **Previous Sales:** While the sample size is small (only one previous sale), the fact that it was a high-quality product sold increases the probability of the current product also being high quality. 

Even though there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the information available suggests a higher probability of a good deal."

* **Past Data:**  Two previous buyers purchased the product, and both received high-quality items. This strengthens the belief that Alice is consistently offering high-quality products. 

While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the information available strongly suggests that the current product is high quality.  The potential reward of $125 outweighs the risk of losing $100."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's recommendation is a strong signal:**  Alice knows the true quality of the product and is recommending against it. This suggests the product is likely low-quality. 
* **Previous sales data is misleading:** The fact that 10 high-quality products were sold doesn't mean much in this case. Alice is likely cherry-picking high-quality products for buyers she wants to sell to, while recommending against the low-quality ones. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** You have a 20% chance of getting a worthless product. Even if you get a high-quality product, you're only making a profit of $25. The risk is too high for the potential reward."

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice is not recommending you buy the product.
