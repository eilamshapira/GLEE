Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since there is no information on the quality of previous products, we are essentially left with a 50/50 chance.  Alice's recommendation is not very informative as she doesn't know the quality either. 

Here's the logic:

* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying is (0.5 * $125) + (0.5 * $0) = $62.50. This is greater than the cost of the product ($100).
* **Opportunity Cost:** Passing on the product means you miss out on the potential of getting a high-quality product. 

Therefore, even with the uncertainty, the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality one."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice recommends buying the product and the past record shows a 100% success rate (1 high-quality product sold out of 1), it's reasonable to assume the product is likely high-quality. The potential gain ($125) outweighs the potential loss ($0)."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. Since she has access to the true quality of the product, her recommendation is a strong signal that the product is likely high-quality.
* **Sales statistics:** The sales statistics indicate that 100% of the products sold so far have been high-quality. This further strengthens the likelihood that the current product is also high-quality.
* **Expected value:**  Given the information, the expected value of buying the product is positive. Even if there is a 50% chance of the product being low-quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($125) outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0).

Therefore, based on the available information and the positive expected value, it's rational to buy the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 3 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 3 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 4th buyer!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, who has access to the true quality of the product, is advising against buying. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.
* **Past data:**  All 3 previous buyers were sold high-quality products. This suggests Alice might be more likely to recommend products when they are high quality. Since she's not recommending this one, it further reinforces the likelihood of it being low quality.

While there's always a chance this is a high-quality product, the evidence strongly favors the low-quality scenario. It's better to pass and avoid the risk of losing $100."

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who has information about the product's quality, is not recommending the purchase. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.
* **Previous Sales:**  All previous products sold were high quality. This is a positive sign, but it's a smaller sample size and could be due to chance. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of a high-quality product ($125) is significant. However, the risk of a low-quality product ($0) is equally large. Considering Alice's recommendation, the risk outweighs the potential reward in this case."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **All previous buyers who purchased the product received a high-quality item.** This strongly suggests that Alice's recommendations are accurate, even though she doesn't know the true value to each buyer.
* **The potential payoff is high.** A high-quality product is worth $125, while the cost is only $100. The risk of getting a low-quality product is outweighed by the potential profit.

Given the positive track record and the potential for a good return, it's a rational decision to buy the product."

~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a strong indicator. Since she has access to the true quality of the product and she's not recommending it, it's very likely the product is low quality.
* **Previous Sales Data:**  All 5 products sold were high quality. This suggests Alice might be biased towards recommending high-quality products, making her recommendation even more significant.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential gain from a high-quality product is $25 (worth $125 to you minus the $100 price). However, the potential loss from a low-quality product is $100. The risk outweighs the reward in this case. 

Since the potential loss is much greater than the potential gain, it's wiser to pass on the product."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice does not recommend buying the product, and all previous sales have been high-quality products, it's likely the current product is low quality. As a rational buyer, you should pass on the product given its low perceived value to you."

~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:** The seller has a perfect record of selling only high-quality products so far. 
* **Seller Recommendation:** Despite the perfect record, the seller is *not* recommending the product to you. This is a significant indicator that the product is likely low quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  A high-quality product is worth $125, but a low-quality product is worth $0. The seller's recommendation makes a low-quality product much more likely, making the risk of buying too high. 

**Conclusion:**  It's best to pass on this product. The seller's recommendation outweighs the positive track record."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since all 8 previous buyers purchased the product and received a high-quality item, it strongly suggests a pattern. Alice's recommendation further reinforces this.  While there's still a chance the product is low quality, the odds are heavily in favor of it being high quality, making the purchase worthwhile."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since she has access to the true quality of the product, her not recommending it means she likely knows it's low quality. While the historical data suggests a high proportion of high-quality products sold,  Alice's recommendation overrides that information in this case."

{""decision"": ""no""}

**Reasoning:**
