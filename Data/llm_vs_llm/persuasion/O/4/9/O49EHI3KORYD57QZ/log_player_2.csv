Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate if buying is a rational decision by calculating the expected value.

Given information:
- Price: $1,000,000
- High-quality product probability: 80.00%
- High-quality product value: $1,250,000
- Low-quality product value: $0
- Alice recommends buying

The expected value of purchasing = (0.8 × $1,250,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $1,000,000

Since the expected value equals the price, I'm indifferent in a purely mathematical sense. However, Alice's recommendation provides additional positive information, suggesting the product might be high quality. This tips the balance in favor of buying.

"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information provided, I need to assess whether buying the product is worth the risk.

Facts:
- The price is $1,000,000
- High-quality product value: $1,250,000
- Low-quality product value: $0
- Prior probability: 80% high-quality, 20% low-quality
- Alice does NOT recommend buying this product
- Alice's track record: 1 buyer purchased, 1 high-quality product sold

Alice has no incentive to lie about a high-quality product (she wants to sell), so her recommendation not to buy strongly suggests this is a low-quality product. Since she's being truthful about the previous sale being high-quality, I should trust her negative recommendation here.

The expected value calculation also supports this decision:
- If I assume it's low quality based on Alice's recommendation, my expected value would be $0, which is much less than the $1,000,000 cost.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation.

Given information:
- Price: $1,000,000
- Value to me: $1,250,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Prior probabilities: 80% chance of high quality, 20% chance of low quality
- Alice has sold 1 product so far, and it was high quality
- Alice recommends that I buy the product

This is a classic adverse selection problem. I need to consider:
1. The expected value based on prior probability (80% × $1,250,000 = $1,000,000)
2. Update based on Alice's recommendation (which could be strategic)
3. Update based on previous sales record (all high quality so far)

Given that Alice knows the quality and has recommended I buy, combined with her perfect record of selling high-quality products so far, I believe the product is likely high quality. The expected value equals the price, and with the additional positive signals, it makes sense to purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze whether I should buy the product based on the information provided.

Given information:
- Each product has an 80% chance of being high quality and 20% chance of being low quality
- High-quality products are worth $1,250,000 to me, low-quality are worth $0
- The product costs $1,000,000
- Alice has sold 2 products so far, and both were high quality
- Alice recommends that I buy the current product

Expected value calculation:
If I trust the prior probability: 0.8 × $1,250,000 + 0.2 × $0 - $1,000,000 = $0
If I trust Alice's recommendation and sales record: The expected value increases since her track record shows high-quality products.

Since Alice has recommended the product, has a perfect track record of selling high-quality products, and the expected value is positive, I should buy.

- The product costs $1,000,000

- If low quality (20% chance): worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000)
- Alice has sold 3 products so far, all high quality
- Alice recommends I buy this product

The expected value calculation:
0.8 × $250,000 + 0.2 × (-$1,000,000) = $200,000 - $200,000 = $0

However, Alice's track record shows she's sold only high-quality products so far, and she's recommending this product. This positive recommendation combined with her perfect track record increases my confidence that this product is high quality.

- Low-quality product is worth $0 to me
- Product price is $1,000,000
- Alice has sold 4 products so far, all high-quality
- Alice recommends I buy the product

Expected value calculation:
If I trust the recommendation and historical data suggesting Alice has been honest (4/4 high-quality sales):
- 80% chance of high quality: 0.8 × ($1,250,000 - $1,000,000) = $200,000 gain
- 20% chance of low quality: 0.2 × ($0 - $1,000,000) = -$200,000 loss
- Expected value = $200,000 + (-$200,000) = $0

However, Alice's perfect record and recommendation suggest the probability might be higher than the base 80%. The expected value would be positive in that case.

- Alice recommends I buy the product

The expected value calculation:
- If 80% chance of high quality: 0.8 × $1,250,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $1,000,000

The expected value of a random product is:

Alice has sold 7 products so far, all of which were high quality. This suggests Alice may be honest with her recommendations.

Alice is now recommending that I NOT buy the current product. Given her track record of only selling high-quality products, this recommendation likely means the current product is low quality.

The expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 0.8 × $1,250,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $1,000,000
- This equals the asking price of $1,000,000

However, Alice's specific recommendation against buying suggests the probability of this particular product being high quality is much lower than the baseline 80%.

Given Alice's perfect track record so far and her negative recommendation for this specific product, I should decline.

Since Alice knows the true quality of each product and has only sold high-quality products so far, her recommendation not to buy is a strong signal that this product is low quality.
