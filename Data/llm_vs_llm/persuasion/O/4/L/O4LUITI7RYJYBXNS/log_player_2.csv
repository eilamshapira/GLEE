Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While there's no past data to rely on, the key here is Alice's recommendation. Since she knows the true quality of the product and is recommending you buy it, there's a strong chance it's high quality. 

Even though there's a 20% chance of it being low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk, especially since there's no other information to work with."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information to go on. We know only one buyer has purchased a product, and it was high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. This is significant, even though we don't know her reasoning. It suggests she believes the product is high quality.
* **Potential Loss:** If we pass, we lose the opportunity to buy a potentially high-quality product. The risk of a low-quality product is significant, but the potential reward of a high-quality product is greater.

**Given the limited information and Alice's recommendation, the risk of passing is higher than the risk of buying.**"
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, who has seen the product, doesn't recommend it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low-quality.
* **Past sales:** While 2 high-quality products have been sold, this doesn't guarantee that future products will be the same. The 20% chance of a low-quality product is still present. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of buying (a $1,250,000 gain) is significant, but the potential loss (a $1,000,000 loss) is also very high. Given the lack of information and Alice's negative recommendation, the risk outweighs the potential reward."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The sales record shows that 100% of products sold so far were high quality. This strongly suggests that Alice's recommendations are accurate. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommending the purchase further strengthens the likelihood of the product being high quality.

While there's still a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the available information heavily favors the product being high quality, making it a worthwhile gamble."

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  Alice has a 100% success rate in recommending high-quality products so far. 
* **No Information on Low-Quality Products:** We don't have any information about Alice recommending low-quality products, so we can't assess her accuracy in those cases.
* **Potential High Reward:** The potential gain from a high-quality product is substantial ($1,250,000). 

While there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward from the high-quality product outweighs the risk.  It's worth taking a gamble given Alice's perfect track record."

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is based on her knowledge of the product's quality. Since she's not recommending you to buy, it's highly likely that the product is of low quality.  While there's a chance she could be wrong, the information provided suggests it's a risky purchase."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which suggests she believes it's high-quality. While her information is not perfect, it's a positive signal.
* **Past Data:**  100% of the products sold so far have been high-quality. This is a strong indicator that the products Alice is offering are likely to be of high quality.
* **Expected Value:**  Given the high probability of the product being high-quality (based on the past data), the expected value of buying is positive:
    * Expected value = (Probability of high-quality) * (Value of high-quality) + (Probability of low-quality) * (Value of low-quality)
    * Expected value = (0.8) * ($1,250,000) + (0.2) * ($0) = $1,000,000

Since the expected value is equal to the price, and there's a strong likelihood of getting a high-quality product, it's worthwhile to buy."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** All previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation ended up with a high-quality product. This suggests a strong correlation between Alice's recommendations and product quality. 
* **Value Potential:**  Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain of $1,250,000 from a high-quality product far outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000. 
* **Limited Information:** While there's always a risk, we have no other information about the current product other than Alice's recommendation, which has been proven accurate so far.

**Note:** This decision is based on the available information and the assumption that Alice is acting in good faith, attempting to sell high-quality products.  There is still a chance the current product might be low quality."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high-quality, as she wouldn't recommend a product that is likely to be worthless to you.
* **Sales Record:**  All 6 previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendations received high-quality products. This reinforces the reliability of Alice's recommendations.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the product is low-quality (20% chance), you lose $1,000,000.  However, if it's high-quality (80% chance), you gain $250,000. The potential reward outweighs the potential risk given the information available. 

Therefore, based on the available information, it is highly likely that the product is of high quality, making it a worthwhile purchase."

{""decision"": ""yes""}

**Reasoning:**

* **No information on low-quality products:** We only know about the high-quality products sold. We don't know if any low-quality products were offered and rejected.
* **Perfect track record:** The seller has a 100% success rate for high-quality products. This implies a strong ability to identify high-quality products.
* **Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. This, combined with her track record, increases the probability that the current product is high-quality.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has a perfect track record. All 11 products she recommended have been high quality.  Since the product is worth $1,250,000 to you if it's high quality, and $0 if it's low quality, you are guaranteed to make a profit if you buy it. The risk of getting a low-quality product is outweighed by the potential reward."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Perfect Track Record:** Since all previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation purchased high-quality products, it's highly likely this product is also high quality.
* **No Risk:** If you buy and it's low-quality, you lose $1,000,000. However, if it's high quality, you gain $250,000.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Passing on the product means you miss out on the potential gain if it is high-quality. 

Considering the strong evidence and potential gains, buying the product is the most rational decision."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice's recommendations have been accurate so far (all 13 buyers who purchased based on her recommendation got high-quality products), it's safe to assume she has perfect knowledge of the product quality. Given her recommendation to buy, we can assume the product is high quality. Even though there's still a 20% chance it could be low quality, the potential reward of $1,250,000 significantly outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000."
