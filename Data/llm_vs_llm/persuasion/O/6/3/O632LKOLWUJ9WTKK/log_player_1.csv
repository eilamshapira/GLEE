I want to build a reputation as a reliable seller, so even though this isn't a high-quality product, I'm still offering it at a price significantly less than the potential payoff from a high-quality product. This loss-leader strategy aims to encourage future transactions based on building trust. I will try to indicate high quality when I can, but sometimes I have to move inventory of all types.""}
