Alice's message: This is a high-quality product.  I know you can't verify this directly, but I promise this one is worth the $100. Since this is the first round, you have no prior information about my honesty, so you'll have to take a risk if you want the potential $300 payoff.

"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice's message: I understand you might be hesitant after the last round.  However, remember that there's a 50/50 chance of a high-quality product. The potential reward of $300 is still significantly higher than the cost. I want to build a reputation as a reliable seller, so even though this isn't a high-quality product, I'm still offering it at a price significantly less than the potential payoff from a high-quality product. This loss-leader strategy aims to encourage future transactions based on building trust. I will try to indicate high quality when I can, but sometimes I have to move inventory of all types.

Alice's message: I know the last potential buyer declined, which is understandable.  But consider this: the odds are still 50/50 for a high-quality product. One failed sale doesn't change the inherent value proposition. I know selling the low-quality products presents a challenge. However, I'm confident in providing high-quality products enough times to earn your repeat business.
