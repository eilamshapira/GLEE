Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Expected value calculation:
   * 80% chance of high quality ($1,200,000) = $960,000
   * 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
   * Total expected value = $960,000

3. Seller's recommendation: Positive
4. No prior sales history to validate seller's credibility

Even though the seller recommends buying, the expected value ($960,000) is less than the asking price ($1,000,000). Without any track record to establish trust in the seller's recommendations, it would be financially unwise to make this purchase.

3. Considerations:
   * The expected value ($960,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000)
   * Alice's recommendation might be biased since she wants to sell
   * No previous sales history to validate Alice's reliability
   * The risk of losing $1,000,000 with a 20% probability is significant

Given that the expected value is less than the price and there's no track record to trust Alice's recommendation, it would be financially prudent to decline.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1) Product price: $1,000,000
2) Expected value calculation:
   * 80% chance of high quality ($1,200,000) = $960,000
   * 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
   * Total expected value = $960,000

3) Seller's recommendation: Positive
4) No prior sales history to reference

Given that:
- The expected value ($960,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000)
- There's no track record to establish trust
- Even with a favorable recommendation, the risk of losing $1,000,000 (with 20% probability) is significant
- The potential profit ($200,000) doesn't justify the risk of total loss

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (80% chance): $1,200,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $1,200,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $960,000

The expected value ($960,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), indicating a negative expected return of -$40,000.

Even though Alice recommends buying the product, I need to be cautious since:
1. There's no track record to verify Alice's reliability
2. The expected value is below the purchase price
3. The risk of total loss (20% chance) is significant

{""decision"": ""no""}"

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think this through:

1. Base probability of high quality: 80%
2. Price: $1,000,000
3. Value if high quality: $1,200,000
4. Value if low quality: $0
5. Alice doesn't recommend buying
6. No prior sales history to reference

Expected value calculation:
- If high quality (80%): $1,200,000 * 0.8 = $960,000
- If low quality (20%): $0 * 0.2 = $0
- Total expected value: $960,000

The fact that Alice doesn't recommend buying is concerning, as she knows the true quality. This likely indicates it's a low-quality product.

Given Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase, I should trust her recommendation.

1. Base probability of high quality: 80%
2. Expected value without additional information:
   * 80% chance of $1,200,000 = $960,000
   * 20% chance of $0 = $0
   * Total expected value = $960,000

4. Alice doesn't recommend buying
