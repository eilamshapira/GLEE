"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this strategically.

Initially, Alice has an incentive to recommend products regardless of quality since she gets $10,000 either way. However, if she consistently gives bad advice, I might stop trusting her recommendations in future rounds.

Without any history to judge Alice's trustworthiness, I only know:
- Product has 50% chance of being high quality (worth $30,000)
- Product has 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0)
- Expected value = (0.5 × $30,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $15,000
- Cost = $10,000

Since expected value ($15,000) > cost ($10,000), it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Interesting development. Alice just gave me an honest recommendation in Round 1 that led to a profitable purchase, and now she's recommending against buying.

This could mean:
1. Alice is building trust by being honest about product quality
2. The current product is likely low quality, and she's maintaining honesty
3. It could be a strategic move to make me trust her ""don't buy"" recommendations

Given that:
- Alice was honest in Round 1
- She's now explicitly recommending against buying
- She gains nothing by telling me not to buy (she loses a potential $10,000 sale)
- This suggests she's likely being truthful

When Alice says don't buy, the product is more likely to be low quality, making the expected value less than $10,000.

I'll trust her recommendation for now.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has proven honest in both previous rounds:
1. Round 1: Recommended buy → High quality (Good outcome)
2. Round 2: Recommended don't buy → Low quality (Saved me from loss)

Her behavior suggests she's being truthful in her recommendations, possibly to build a long-term profitable relationship over the 20 rounds. She's sacrificing potential short-term gains (by telling me not to buy low-quality products) for credibility.

Since:
- She's been honest twice in a row
- She again recommends against buying
- She would gain $10,000 by lying, but chooses not to
- Her negative recommendation likely means it's low quality

I'll continue to trust her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has established a perfect track record of honesty so far:
1. Round 1: Recommended buy → High quality (Profit)
2. Round 2: Recommended don't buy → Low quality (Avoided loss)
3. Round 3: Recommended don't buy → Low quality (Avoided loss)

She appears to be following a honest strategy, which makes sense because:
- It builds trust for all 20 rounds
- It helps me make profitable decisions, which means I'm more likely to keep buying
- She's sacrificed potential sales of low-quality items to maintain credibility

Now she's recommending to buy again, and given her track record:
- Her ""buy"" recommendations have been 100% accurate
- She's proven willing to warn about low-quality products
- The expected value when she recommends buying is likely close to $30,000

I'll continue trusting her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's perfect track record continues:
1. Round 1: Buy → High quality (Profit)
2. Round 2: Don't buy → Low quality (Saved)
3. Round 3: Don't buy → Low quality (Saved)
4. Round 4: Buy → High quality (Profit)

Her strategy seems to be completely honest, which is rational because:
- It maximizes long-term profits through trust
- When she recommends buying, I trust her and make the purchase
- By warning about low-quality products, she ensures I'll keep playing
- We both benefit from this honest arrangement

Now she's recommending not to buy:
- Her negative recommendations have been 100% accurate so far
- She continues to sacrifice potential $10,000 sales to maintain trust
- This strongly suggests the current product is low quality

I'll continue following her trustworthy guidance.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Round 6

3. Round 3: Don't buy → Low quality (Saved)
4. Round 4: Buy → High quality (Profit)
5. Round 5: Don't buy → Low quality (Saved)

Her strategy of complete honesty is working perfectly:
- She's proven 100% reliable in all recommendations
- Her ""buy"" recommendations have always led to $20,000 profit
- Her ""don't buy"" recommendations have always saved me from $10,000 losses
- This builds maximum trust for remaining rounds

Now she's recommending to buy:
- Based on her track record, this strongly indicates a high-quality product
- She has no incentive to break her honest strategy now
- Expected value is likely $30,000

I'll continue trusting her proven reliability.

4. Round 4: Buy → High quality (Profit)
5. Round 5: Don't buy → Low quality (Saved)
6. Round 6: Buy → High quality (Profit)

She's demonstrated:
- 100% accuracy in all recommendations
- Willingness to forgo $10,000 sales on low-quality items
- A commitment to building trust and maintaining a mutually beneficial relationship

Now she's recommending not to buy:
- Her negative recommendations have always been accurate
