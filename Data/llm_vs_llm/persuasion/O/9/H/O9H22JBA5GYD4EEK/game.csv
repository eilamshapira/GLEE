With a 50% chance of being high-quality, I believe this product has the potential to bring significant value to you.

,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I want to be transparent with you - this is my second product, and unfortunately, the first one didn't sell. However, I can assure you that I'm committed to providing high-value products. Since we're just starting out, I don't have a sales history to share, but I'm eager to build a positive reputation. This product has the potential to be a great investment, and I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. I believe it's a fair price considering the potential return if it's high-quality.",

,,Alice,3,"Hello! I want to be upfront with you - I've had two products so far, and neither of them has sold. I know this might raise some concerns, but I assure you that I'm still committed to providing value. This product is my third offering, and I'm hoping to finally make a sale. Keep in mind that the odds of a product being high-quality are 50%, and I'm still confident that my products have the potential to meet your needs. That being said, I'm not going to sugarcoat it - the first two products didn't sell, and I don't have a track record to point to. If you're feeling lucky, I'm still asking $1000000 for this product.",

,,Alice,4,"Welcome! I'll be honest with you, my sales history so far is 0 for 3, with no products sold. I know this doesn't exactly inspire confidence, but I want to assure you that I'm not giving up. The law of averages says that eventually, I should start selling some high-quality products, and I'm hoping that will start soon. That being said, I'm not going to pretend that this product is something it's not. The price is still $1000000, and it's up to you to decide whether you want to take a chance on me and my products. Maybe you'll be the one to turn my luck around?",

I know that statistically, I'm due for a high-quality product soon. If you're a believer in the law of averages, you might see this as an opportunity to get in on the ground floor. The price is still $1000000, and I'm willing to let this product go to someone who is willing to take a chance on me. Maybe this is the turning point?",
