Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected Value calculation:
- High quality (50%): $4,000,000 × 0.5 = $2,000,000
- Low quality (50%): $0 × 0.5 = $0
- Total Expected Value = $2,000,000

2. Cost: $1,000,000

3. Considerations:
- Alice recommends buying
- No previous sales history to validate Alice's credibility
- Expected value ($2,000,000) > Cost ($1,000,000)
- Potential profit: $1,000,000 (Expected Value - Cost)

Since the expected value is twice the cost, even without considering Alice's recommendation, this is a mathematically favorable bet.

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality: $4,000,000 (50% chance)
   - Low quality: $0 (50% chance)
3. Track record:
   - 1 previous buyer
   - 1 high-quality product sold
   - Alice has been honest so far
4. Alice recommends buying

Given that:
- Alice's previous recommendation led to a successful high-quality sale
- The expected value of a random product (($4M × 0.5) + ($0 × 0.5) = $2M) is higher than the price
- Alice is recommending to buy
- Alice has shown truthfulness in her previous recommendation

This seems like a good opportunity with positive expected value.

- Alice is recommending this product

2. Economics:
- Cost: $1,000,000

   - Low quality: $0 (50% chance)
3. Track record:
   - 3 buyers so far

   - 100% success rate on recommendations

The fact that Alice has a perfect track record (3/3 high-quality products) and is now recommending this product is a very positive signal. Her recommendations have been reliable so far.

Expected value calculation:
- If Alice's recommendations are trustworthy, the expected value would be close to $4,000,000
- Even with some uncertainty, this far exceeds the $1,000,000 price

Given Alice's perfect track record and current recommendation, the risk appears manageable relative to the potential reward.

3. Analysis:
- Alice's perfect track record suggests trustworthiness
- Her recommendation to buy is a positive signal
- Even though each product has a 50/50 chance initially, Alice's recommendation and track record significantly increase the likelihood of high quality

- The expected value calculation even without considering Alice's recommendation:
  (50% × $3,000,000) + (50% × -$1,000,000) = $1,000,000 positive expected value

1. Price of product: $1,000,000
2. Potential value: $4,000,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
3. Historical data:
   - 7 buyers purchased
   - 6 high-quality products sold

4. Alice is recommending to buy

The historical data suggests Alice's recommendations have been reliable. With 6 out of 7 products being high quality, and now receiving a positive recommendation, the probability seems favorable. The expected value calculation:

If similar success rate continues:
86% chance of $4M (high quality) = $3.44M
14% chance of $0 (low quality) = $0
Expected value = $3.44M

Since the expected value ($3.44M) is significantly higher than the price ($1M), and Alice has demonstrated good reliability in previous recommendations...
