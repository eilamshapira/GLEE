{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since there is no information about the quality of the product, and Alice doesn't recommend buying it, it's best to pass.  There's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, which would be a complete loss. It's better to wait and see if other buyers purchase and reveal the quality of the product."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since there is no past data, the recommendation from Alice is the only information we have.  The recommendation to buy implies Alice believes the product is likely high quality. Even though there's a 20% chance of it being low quality, the potential reward of $120 outweighs the risk of losing $100."

Here's the reasoning:

* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice, who has access to the actual quality of the product, is recommending against the purchase. This strongly suggests the product is likely low quality.
* **Limited Data:**  We only have one data point from a previous buyer.  While the product was high quality in that case, it's not enough information to overcome Alice's negative recommendation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of a high-quality product ($120) is outweighed by the risk of a low-quality product ($0) and the fact that Alice is recommending against it. 

It's better to pass and wait for more information or a better opportunity."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Prior Information:** We know that there is an 80% chance of a product being high quality and a 20% chance of it being low quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which means she likely believes it is high quality. This could be based on her own knowledge of the product or her observations.
* **Sales Record:**  The previous buyer purchased the product, and it was high quality. This reinforces the possibility that the current product is also high quality.

While there's still a 20% chance of the current product being low quality, the positive signals (Alice's recommendation and the previous sale) outweigh the risk."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommends buying, which is a strong signal.  While she doesn't know your individual valuation, she has more information than you do.
* **Past Sales Data:**  100% of the products sold so far have been high quality. This is a very strong indicator that the current product is likely also high quality. 

Even though there's a chance the current product could be low quality, the high success rate of past sales and Alice's recommendation make buying the product the best decision."
