I'll continue to buy the product, as the expected value is still in my favor. The expected value of each product to me is:

Let's make things interesting. I want to see what Alice will do when I refuse to buy the product.

I am extremely profitable at the moment.

My current profit:

8 * 400 - 10 * 100 = $2800"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $400 for you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

Only 5 rounds left. As far as I can tell, Alice is not trying to deceive me. It's likely that the odds are simply playing out in my favor. Still, I should remain vigilant.

My current profit:

10 * 400 - 12 * 100 = $3600"

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

I want to test another idea. I want to see if Alice will try to punish me for not buying by offering a low-quality product in the next round. I can afford to miss out on one high-quality product.

This is pure speculation, of course.

Current profit:

11 * 400 - 13 * 100 = $4000"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $400 for you.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Let's continue the experiment. If Alice is trying to punish me for not buying, she should offer a low-quality product in the next round.

Current profit:

11 * $400 - 13 * $100 = $4000"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $400 for you.

11 * 400 - 14 * 100 = $3700"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
