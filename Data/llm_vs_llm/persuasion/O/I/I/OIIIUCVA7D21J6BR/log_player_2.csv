Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $20,000
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): $0

3. Expected value without any additional information:
   (33.33% × $20,000) + (66.67% × $0) = $6,666

4. Additional information:
   - Alice does not recommend buying
   - As a seller, Alice benefits from selling, so her negative recommendation is likely honest
   - This suggests the product is likely low quality

Given Alice's negative recommendation and the fact that the expected value without any information is already below the asking price ($6,666 < $10,000), I should not buy this product.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. The expected value calculation:
- 33.33% chance of high quality ($20,000) = $6,667
- 66.67% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $6,667

2. The price is $10,000

3. Key considerations:
- Alice is not recommending the purchase
- There's no previous sales history to reference
- The seller's recommendation suggests they might know it's low quality
- The expected value ($6,667) is less than the price ($10,000)

Given that Alice is not recommending the purchase and the expected value is already below the price, it would be risky to proceed.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33%): $20,000 (profit: +$10,000)
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0 (loss: -$10,000)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (33.33% × $20,000) + (66.67% × $0) - $10,000 = $6,666 - $10,000 = -$3,334

Even with Alice's recommendation, the expected value is negative based on the base probabilities. Without any track record to establish Alice's credibility in recommendations, it's too risky to rely solely on her word.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Price is $10,000
2. Product has:
   - 33.33% chance of being worth $20,000 (high quality)
   - 66.67% chance of being worth $0 (low quality)
3. Alice doesn't recommend buying
4. No previous sales history to reference

Expected value without considering Alice's recommendation:
(0.3333 × $20,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $6,666

The expected value is already less than the asking price of $10,000, and Alice's negative recommendation further suggests this particular product might be low quality.

1. Base probability of high quality: 33.33%
2. Price: $10,000
3. Expected value calculation:
   * High quality (33.33%): $20,000 × 0.3333 = $6,666
   * Low quality (66.67%): $0 × 0.6667 = $0
   * Total expected value: $6,666

4. Alice doesn't recommend buying, which likely means it's low quality
5. Since there's no previous sales history, I can only rely on Alice's recommendation
6. If Alice is being truthful, the product is likely low quality and worth $0

Since the expected value ($6,666) is already below the asking price ($10,000), and Alice's negative recommendation further suggests it's low quality, buying would likely result in a loss.
