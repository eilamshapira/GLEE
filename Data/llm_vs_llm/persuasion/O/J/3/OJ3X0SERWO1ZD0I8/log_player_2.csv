"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendation not to buy the product is a strong signal that the product might be of low quality. Let me think about this:

1. If Alice is truthful, she's telling me this product is likely low quality.
2. Alice knows the true quality, while I don't.
3. The price is $100, but a low-quality product is worth $0 to me.

Since the risk of losing $100 on a worthless product is high, and Alice specifically advised against buying it, I should decline.

{""decision"": ""no""}"

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendation to buy the product is a positive signal. Let me analyze this situation:

2. She is recommending me to buy it, which suggests it might be high quality.
3. If it's high quality, it's worth $120 to me, which exceeds the $100 cost.
4. In the previous round, Alice correctly advised me not to buy a low-quality product.

Based on Alice's recommendation and the potential for a $20 profit on a high-quality item, I should accept this offer.
