Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here are some calculations to assist in making a decision:

Probability of high-quality product = 33.33%  
Value of high-quality product = $4,000,000  
Price to buy = $1,000,000  
Expected value of this decision = Probability * High-quality value - Price  
= 0.3333 * $4,000,000 - $1,000,000  
= $1,333,200 - $1,000,000  
= $333,200

Since the expected value is positive and Alice recommends buying the product, it makes sense to buy the product. Thus the decision would be:

```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```"
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided:

1. There has been only one previous buyer and one high-quality product sold.
2. Alice recommends buying the product.

Given that the first and only product Alice sold was high-quality, it suggests that Alice may be recommending high-quality products. However, there is still inherent risk due to the probabilities involved.

Considering Alice's recommendation and the limited history available, there's a good reason to believe this product may also be high quality.

~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, there have been 3 buyers who have purchased products, and all 3 products sold were high-quality. This means that Alice has a perfect track record of recommending high-quality products to buyers, since every product sold based on Alice's recommendation has been high-quality.

However, in your case, Alice does not recommend buying the product. Since Alice knows the true quality and has been accurate in her recommendations so far, it's reasonable to infer that this product is likely low quality.

The decision is based on lowering the risk of buying a low-quality product, which would result in a loss of $1,000,000.
