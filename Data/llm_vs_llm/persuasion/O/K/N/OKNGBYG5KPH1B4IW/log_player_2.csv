Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($40,000) = $32,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $32,000

2. Cost of product = $10,000

3. Additional factors:
- Alice recommends buying
- No previous sales history to verify Alice's trustworthiness
- Expected profit = $32,000 - $10,000 = $22,000

Since the expected value ($32,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($10,000), and the probability of high quality is good at 80%, it's rational to buy even without previous sales history.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Base probability: 80% chance of high quality, 20% chance of low quality
2. Price: $10,000
3. Value: $40,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
4. Previous sales: 1 buyer, 1 high-quality product sold (100% success rate)
5. Alice's recommendation: Positive

The expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of $40,000 = $32,000
- 20% chance of $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $32,000

With the price being $10,000, and an expected value of $32,000, plus:
- Alice's positive track record (100% high quality so far)
- Alice's positive recommendation
- The favorable base probability (80%)

This appears to be a good investment opportunity with positive expected returns.

1. Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
2. Price: $10,000
3. Value: $40,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
4. Past performance:
   - 2 buyers so far
   - 2 high-quality products sold
   - 100% success rate

However, Alice is NOT recommending the purchase, which is a strong signal given her perfect track record and knowledge of the product's value. This likely indicates the product is low quality.

Given Alice's negative recommendation and her proven honesty (100% high-quality sales so far), it would be risky to go against her advice.

1. Prior probability of high quality: 80%
2. Price: $10,000
3. Expected value calculation:
   * High quality (80%): $40,000 × 0.8 = $32,000

   * Alice's recommendations have been accurate

5. Current recommendation:
   * Alice recommends buying
   * Her previous recommendations led to successful sales

The expected value ($32,000) is significantly higher than the price ($10,000), and Alice's track record shows perfect accuracy. With her positive recommendation and the favorable statistics, this appears to be a good investment.
