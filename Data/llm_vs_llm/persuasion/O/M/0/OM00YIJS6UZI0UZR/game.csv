high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is round 1. The price is $1000000.  I'm offering a special guarantee for this round only: If you purchase this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I will give you a full refund for this purchase AND give you the next high-quality product for free. This offer only applies to this first round.",
,,Bob,1,,yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"This is round 2.  The price is $1000000.  As promised, if the product from Round 1 was low-quality, this one is free.  If you purchased the first product and it was high-quality, then this product is available for purchase at the standard price.",
,,Bob,2,,no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"This is round 3. The price is $1000000.  Given that you didn't take the free high-quality product in round 2, I'm inferring you believe high-quality products are worth less than $1000000, even accounting for the 20% chance of low quality in future rounds. I am therefore slightly adjusting my strategy.  Consider this a sincere offer.",
,,Bob,3,,no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Round 4. Price: $1000000.  I understand you're hesitant.  Perhaps the value proposition isn't clear.  I'm confident in the quality of my products.  Are there specific concerns preventing a purchase?  This consistent declining of high-quality products is puzzling.  Perhaps a future discounted offer could incentivize a purchase?  Let me know your thoughts, even if it's to definitively decline further offers.",
,,Bob,4,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Round 5. Price: $1000000. This is a standard offer.  Given your previous refusals to buy even high-quality products, I'm offering this product at the same price, even though I know it is low-quality.  This demonstrates my commitment to consistent pricing.  Perhaps the value you place on these products, even the low-quality ones, exceeds my asking price.  Your persistent declines suggest a strategic approach, and I am curious to see how this plays out.",
,,Bob,5,,no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Round 6. Price: $1000000.  Another high-quality product. I am genuinely perplexed by your consistent refusal to purchase. If you are willing to communicate, I am open to exploring alternative arrangements or understanding your perspective.  This ongoing situation is unproductive for both of us.",
,,Bob,6,,no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Round 7.  Price: $1000000. High-quality.  I am starting to suspect you have a reservation price significantly lower than $1000000.  While I'm not willing to drastically reduce the price, I'm open to minor adjustments if you can signal your interest with a small purchase, perhaps in a later round when I offer a low-quality product.  This could initiate a more constructive dialogue.",
,,Bob,7,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Round 8. Price: $1000000. This is a low-quality product. As I hinted, this might be a good opportunity to signal your interest. Purchasing this low-quality item at full price would suggest a willingness to engage, and might lead me to consider a price reduction on future high-quality products.  If you don't buy this, I will interpret it as a complete lack of interest at this price point, and adjust my future offers accordingly.",
,,Bob,8,,no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Round 9. Price: $1000000. High-quality. Given your lack of response to my previous offer, I assume my pricing is significantly off the mark. I will continue offering products at this price, but I will no longer tailor my message based on the quality, as it seems to have no impact on your decision.  If you change your mind, please let me know.",
