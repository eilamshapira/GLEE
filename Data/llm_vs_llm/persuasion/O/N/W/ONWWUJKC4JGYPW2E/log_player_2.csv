Alice's message: This is a fantastic opportunity! This product could really change your life. I have a strong feeling about this one.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $10,000
2. Expected value calculation:
   * 33.33% chance of high quality ($40,000) = $13,333
   * 66.67% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
   * Total expected value = $13,333

3. Considerations:
   * The expected value ($13,333) is higher than the price ($10,000)
   * No previous sales history to validate Alice's credibility
   * Alice's message is very enthusiastic but non-specific
   * The recommendation could be trying to exploit first-mover optimism

While the expected value is favorable, Alice's vague enthusiasm without specific quality claims, combined with no track record to establish trust, makes this a risky decision.

Alice's message: I'm very confident in this product. It's a game-changer.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33%): $40,000
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (33.33% × $40,000) + (66.67% × $0) = $13,332

4. Considerations:
   - Expected value ($13,332) > Price ($10,000)
   - No previous sales history to verify Alice's credibility
   - Alice's enthusiastic recommendation
   - Base probability favors low quality (66.67%)

While the expected value is higher than the price, there's significant risk. However, given the potential upside and the seller's strong recommendation, it's worth taking the calculated risk.

Alice's message: This product is truly special. I have a great feeling about this one – it's a top-tier item.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Prior probabilities:
- 33.33% chance of high quality ($40,000 value)
- 66.67% chance of low quality ($0 value)

2. Sales history:
- 1 previous buyer purchased
- 0 high-quality products sold
- This suggests the previous sale was a low-quality product

3. Seller's message is very positive, but considering:
- The previous sale was likely low quality
- The 2:1 odds of getting a low-quality product
- The fixed price of $10,000
- Expected value = (0.3333 × $40,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $13,332

The expected value is only slightly higher than the price, and the sales history suggests possible deceptive practices. The risk is too high.

   - High quality: $40,000 (33.33% chance)
   - Low quality: $0 (66.67% chance)

Red flags:
- Out of 1 previous sale, 0 were high quality

3. Previous sales:

Alice's enthusiastic recommendation needs to be weighed against the fact that her previous recommendation led to a sale of a low-quality product. This suggests she might not be truthful in her recommendations.

The expected value calculation:
- 33.33% chance of $40,000 = $13,333
- 66.67% chance of $0 = $0
Total expected value = $13,333

Since the price ($10,000) is less than the expected value ($13,333), it might seem like a good deal mathematically. However, the previous sale being low quality raises serious concerns about Alice's credibility.

Given the evidence of misleading recommendations in the past, I'll decline.
