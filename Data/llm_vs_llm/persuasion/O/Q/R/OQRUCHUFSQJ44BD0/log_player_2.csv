"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to think through this decision carefully. 

Alice has incentive to sell me products regardless of quality since she gets $10,000 either way. The fact that she recommends buying doesn't provide useful information since she benefits from my purchase regardless of quality.

For me, the expected value calculation is:
- 50% chance of high quality: 0.5 × $12,000 = $6,000
- 50% chance of low quality: 0.5 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value: $6,000

Since the price is $10,000 and the expected value is only $6,000, it's not a good deal for me.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate this situation again.

Alice still has an incentive to recommend products regardless of quality, since she receives $10,000 either way. Her recommendation doesn't provide reliable information about the product's quality.

The expected value calculation remains:
- 50% chance of high quality: 0.5 × $12,000 = $6,000
- 50% chance of low quality: 0.5 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value: $6,000

Since the price ($10,000) exceeds the expected value ($6,000), buying would be a losing proposition for me on average.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to continue evaluating each offer independently.

Alice's incentive structure remains unchanged - she benefits from selling me products regardless of their quality, earning $10,000 either way. Her recommendation provides no reliable signal about quality.

The expected value calculation is still:
- 50% chance of high quality: 0.5 × $12,000 = $6,000
- 50% chance of low quality: 0.5 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value: $6,000

Since the expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000), buying would result in an expected loss of $4,000.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to maintain the same analytical approach.

Alice's incentives haven't changed - she earns $10,000 from each sale regardless of product quality. Her recommendation doesn't provide meaningful information about the quality.

The expected value calculation remains:
- 50% chance of high quality: 0.5 × $12,000 = $6,000
- 50% chance of low quality: 0.5 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value: $6,000

Since the price ($10,000) exceeds the expected value ($6,000), buying would be an economically irrational decision for me.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to continue evaluating each offer based on the expected value.

Although I missed out on a high-quality product in the previous round, the fundamental economics haven't changed. Alice still earns $10,000 regardless of quality, so her recommendation doesn't provide reliable information.

The expected value calculation remains:
- 50% chance of high quality: 0.5 × $12,000 = $6,000
- 50% chance of low quality: 0.5 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value: $6,000

Since the price ($10,000) is higher than the expected value ($6,000), buying would result in an expected loss of $4,000.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Alice's incentive structure remains unchanged - she receives $10,000 per sale regardless of quality. Her recommendation doesn't provide reliable information about the product's quality.

The expected value calculation is still:
- 50% chance of high quality: 0.5 × $12,000 = $6,000

- Total expected value: $6,000

Since the price ($10,000) exceeds the expected value ($6,000), buying would result in an expected loss of $4,000 for me.
