Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make a decision, let's consider the data provided:

- Alice has sold 3 products to previous buyers, all of which were high quality.
- Alice recommends buying the product.

Given that 100% of the products sold have been high quality and Alice recommends this product, there is a strong indication of a high-quality product.

In this scenario, the expected profit if I purchase:
- With 100% success rate so far, I can assume the product is of high quality, thus worth $20,000.
- The cost is $10,000.

Expected profit = $20,000 (value) - $10,000 (cost) = $10,000.

Considering the above analysis, my decision is:
