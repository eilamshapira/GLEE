Additionally, you might want to start providing some statistics to the buyers to build trust. For example:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""So far, 5 products have been sold, and all of them were high-quality. You have an 80% chance to have the same experience!""
}
```"

  ""message"": ""So far, 7 products have been sold, and 5 of them were high-quality. You still have an 80% chance to get a high-quality product! Don't miss out!""
}
```

I think we should still encourage the buyer to purchase the product. The buyer is aware of the 80% probability of getting a high-quality product, and our current record aligns with this probability. Therefore, it makes sense to continue recommending the purchase."

Round 8

}
```

At this point we are in a difficult situation. We have sold a significant amount of low quality products in a row. We still want to encourage the buyer to purchase the product. We can still justify this by reminding the new buyer of the overall probability of receiving a high-quality product. However, we must be aware that if the number of low quality products increases, the buyer will be less likely to trust our recommendation."

We have now sold 7 high quality products in a row. We should obviously encourage the buyer to purchase the product.

As a side note, it is interesting to see such a long streak of high quality products. This makes me wonder if there is some kind of dependency between the rounds. However, we should still act under the assumption that the quality of the product in each round is an independent event with a probability of 80% of being high quality."
