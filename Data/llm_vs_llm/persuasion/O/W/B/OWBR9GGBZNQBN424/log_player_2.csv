Alice's message: Hello! I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product for only $10000.  This is a one-time opportunity, and I believe you'll be very satisfied. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to carefully evaluate this offer. 

The product costs $10,000. If it's high quality (50% chance), it's worth $12,500 to me, giving me a $2,500 profit. If it's low quality (50% chance), it's worth $0, causing me to lose $10,000.

Expected value = (0.5 × $12,500) + (0.5 × $0) - $10,000 = $6,250 - $10,000 = -$3,750

Alice hasn't provided any information about the quality of this specific product or shown me a product with its revealed quality as described in the game rules. Also, there's no sales history to evaluate her trustworthiness.

Given the negative expected value and lack of quality information, I should decline.

Alice's message: Greetings! I have a high-quality product available for $10000.  This is a great deal considering its true value.  I'm confident you won't be disappointed. What are your thoughts?

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this carefully:

- The product costs $10,000
- If high quality (50% chance), it's worth $12,500 to me (+$2,500 profit)
- If low quality (50% chance), it's worth $0 to me (-$10,000 loss)
- Expected value: 0.5 × (+$2,500) + 0.5 × (-$10,000) = -$3,750

Alice claims the product is high quality, but I have no prior evidence of her trustworthiness. The expected value calculation shows that without additional verification, purchasing is not favorable.

Alice's message: Good day! I'm offering a product that's worth a lot more than the $10000 asking price.  It's a genuine opportunity to acquire something of great value.  Would you like to learn more?

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate this decision carefully. 

Alice is offering a product for $10,000 that has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $12,500 to me) and a 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me).

The expected value is: 0.5 × $12,500 + 0.5 × $0 = $6,250

Since the expected value ($6,250) is less than the asking price ($10,000), it would not be rational for me to buy the product without additional information that changes the probability assessment.

Alice hasn't revealed the quality of this specific product, and there's no sales history to evaluate her reliability. Her message is vague and doesn't provide concrete information about the product's quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to carefully consider this decision.

Alice is offering a product for $10,000. The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $12,500 to me) and a 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me).

Alice hasn't provided me with information about the specific quality of this product. She simply stated it's ""a great deal"" and ""good value"" which is vague and doesn't tell me if it's high or low quality.

The expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of gaining $12,500 (value) - $10,000 (cost) = $2,500 profit
- 50% chance of losing $10,000 (cost)
Expected value = 0.5 × $2,500 + 0.5 × (-$10,000) = $1,250 - $5,000 = -$3,750

Since the expected value is negative, it's not rational for me to purchase the product without more specific information about its quality.
