Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Value of high-quality product: $12,500 (profit = $2,500)
3. Value of low-quality product: $0 (loss = -$10,000)
4. Base probability: 33.33% high quality, 66.67% low quality
5. Alice doesn't recommend buying
6. No previous sales history to reference

Given that Alice doesn't recommend the purchase and there's no prior sales history to evaluate her trustworthiness, this seems risky. Moreover:

- Expected value without recommendation: 
  (0.3333 × $12,500) + (0.6667 × $0) = $4,166
  This is already less than the $10,000 price

- Alice's negative recommendation likely means the probability is even lower

The expected value is well below the asking price, and Alice's recommendation reinforces this negative outlook.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $12,500
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.3333 × $12,500) + (0.6667 × $0) = $4,166.25

The expected value ($4,166.25) is less than the price ($10,000), and there's no historical data to validate Alice's trustworthiness in recommendations. Even though Alice recommends buying, the risk of loss is too high given the probability distribution.

1. Price: $10,000
2. Possible values:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $12,500

3. Expected value without additional information:

4. Additional information:
   - Alice doesn't recommend buying
   - As a seller, Alice benefits from selling, so a negative recommendation likely means low quality

Given that Alice doesn't recommend the purchase and the expected value without any information is already below the asking price ($4,166.25 < $10,000), this seems like a risky purchase.
