Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```
I will continue to buy the product each round as the expected utility is positive.

Explanation:
There is a 50% probability that a product is high quality and worth 300 dollars and a 50%  probability that it is low quality and worth 0 dollars.
So the expected value of the product is:

0.5 * 300 + 0.5 * 0 = 150

The price of the product is 100.

So the expected utility of buying the product is:

150 - 100 = 50

Since the expected utility is positive, I should always buy the product."

Even though the last three products were low quality I will continue to accept Alice's recommendation to buy the product.
