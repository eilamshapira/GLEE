"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

Expected value calculation:
- Price: $10,000
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $30,000) = 0.8 × $30,000 = $24,000
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0) = 0.2 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $24,000

Expected profit = Expected value - Price
= $24,000 - $10,000 = $14,000

Since the expected profit is positive ($14,000), it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The previous outcome confirms the game's stated probabilities, but each round is independent.

The same calculation applies:

Expected value calculation:
- Price: $10,000
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $30,000) = 0.8 × $30,000 = $24,000
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0) = 0.2 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $24,000

Expected profit = Expected value - Price
= $24,000 - $10,000 = $14,000

Since the expected profit remains positive ($14,000), it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Despite the previous loss, each round is independent and the fundamental probabilities remain the same.

Expected value calculation:
- Price: $10,000
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $30,000) = 0.8 × $30,000 = $24,000
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0) = 0.2 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $24,000

Expected profit = Expected value - Price
= $24,000 - $10,000 = $14,000

Even though we just experienced a loss, the expected value is still positive and the probabilities haven't changed. It's still rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Each round remains independent, and the underlying probabilities haven't changed.

Expected value calculation:
- Price: $10,000

- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0) = 0.2 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $24,000

Expected profit = Expected value - Price
= $24,000 - $10,000 = $14,000
