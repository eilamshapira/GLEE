Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make an informed decision, let's consider the available statistics:

- So far, there have been 2 buyers before you, and 2 products have been sold.
- Both products sold were high-quality.

Alice recommends you buy the product. Given that the recommendation and the previous statistics suggest that Alice is likely recommending high-quality products, it is reasonable to infer that there is a good chance this product is also high-quality.

Therefore, the expected value calculation seems favorable:

- Expected value if buying (given Alice's recommendation appears to favor high-quality): High chance of being high-quality.

Therefore, I would recommend buying the product.

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make an informed decision, let's analyze the information:

1. Total buyers so far = 8 (including you).
2. 7 prior buyers purchased the product.
3. All 7 products sold were high-quality.
4. Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Given that all previous buyers received recommendations and those products turned out to be high-quality, Alice's recommendation seems to have a strong correlation with high-quality products. Thus, the probability that a recommended product is high-quality appears high based on the observed data.

Given that the product is worth $4,000,000 to you if it's high-quality and only costs $1,000,000, the expected value is highly favorable if the confidence in quality is strong, as it appears to be here.

So, the decision is:
