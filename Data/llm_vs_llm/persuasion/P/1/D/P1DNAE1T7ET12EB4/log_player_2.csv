"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation not to buy, combined with the fact that no products have been sold yet, strongly suggests that the product is likely low quality.  Since a low-quality product is worth $0 to me, it's not worth the risk of buying."
"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since no products have been sold yet, there's no information to base a decision on other than Alice's recommendation. As Alice has no incentive to lie (she makes the same profit regardless of quality), her recommendation should be taken as an indication that the product is high quality.  The expected value of buying is 0.5 * $12,000 + 0.5 * $0 = $6,000, which is greater than the price of $10,000. Therefore, buying the product is the optimal decision."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's recommendation is against buying the product. This suggests that she has information indicating the current product is likely low quality.
* While there's a 50% chance of being high quality, it's unwise to gamble given the lack of evidence and the potential for a complete loss. 
* The previous buyer's purchase of a high-quality product doesn't necessarily mean this product will also be high quality. 
* It's better to pass and wait for a more promising opportunity."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **The prior:**  We know there's a 50/50 chance of a product being high or low quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which is useful information.  Since she doesn't know your individual valuation, her recommendation implies she believes the product is likely high quality.
* **The Data:**  One product was sold, and it was high quality. This reinforces the idea that the product is likely high quality, especially since Alice likely knows the quality of the product she's recommending.

**The Risk/Reward:**

* **Buying:** If the product is high quality, you gain $2,000. If it's low quality, you lose $10,000.
* **Passing:** You gain nothing, and the product is discarded.

Given the recommendation and the data, the odds seem slightly in your favor. It's still a risky decision, but the potential reward outweighs the risk in this case."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since all three previous buyers bought the product and they were all high quality, the current product is likely also high quality.  Even though the probability of a single product being high quality is 50%, the evidence strongly suggests this product is high quality. The recommendation from Alice further reinforces this.  The potential gain ($12,000) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0)."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:**  Alice has recommended 4 products, and all of them have been high quality. This suggests she has a perfect ability to identify high-quality products. 
* **Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation strongly suggests the current product is high quality.
* **Potential Upside:** Even if there's a chance of it being low quality, the potential gain of $12,000 outweighs the potential loss of $10,000.

While there's still a 50% chance of the product being low quality, the evidence overwhelmingly favors it being high quality, making it a worthwhile risk."

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:**  All 5 previous buyers who purchased based on Alice's recommendation received high-quality products. This suggests Alice is a reliable source of information.
* **50/50 Odds:**  While there's always the risk of getting a low-quality product, the odds are still in your favor. A high-quality product nets you $2,000 profit.
* **Opportunity Cost:** If you pass, you lose the chance to potentially get a high-quality product.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who has seen the product's quality, does not recommend buying it. This is a strong indicator that the product is likely low quality.
* **Sales Record:** The sales record shows a perfect track record of high-quality products being sold. This suggests that Alice has been recommending only high-quality products.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Buying the product carries a 50% chance of getting a worthless product. The potential reward of a high-quality product is not worth the risk given Alice's recommendation and the consistent record of high-quality sales."

Here's why:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who has seen the product's quality, is not recommending you buy it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. 
* **Perfect Track Record:**  The sales record shows 100% of the products sold were high quality. This means Alice has consistently recommended only high-quality products.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Since you know the product is worth $12,000 if high quality and $0 if low quality, and Alice is not recommending it, the risk of buying is too high. It's better to pass and avoid the potential loss."

**Explanation:**

Alice has a perfect track record, recommending only high-quality products.  Since she is not recommending this product, it's highly likely it's low quality. Given the 50/50 chance of a product being high or low quality, and Alice's perfect track record, it's statistically more likely this product is low quality and therefore worth nothing to you."

**Reasoning:**

Alice has a perfect track record so far, selling only high-quality products.  Since she's not recommending this product, it strongly suggests that it's low quality.  Given the 50/50 odds and the potential for a $12,000 loss, it's not worth the risk."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, who has access to the actual product quality, does not recommend buying the product. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.
* **Sales data:**  The sales data shows a perfect track record with all 6 previous buyers purchasing high-quality products. This suggests Alice has a strong bias towards recommending high-quality products. 
* **Risk assessment:**  Since the product is worth $12,000 if high quality but $0 if low quality, the risk of buying a low-quality product is very high. 

Given the lack of recommendation from Alice, the high probability of the product being low quality, and the potential for significant loss, it's best to pass on this product."

{""decision"": ""no""}

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since she has consistently recommended high-quality products in the past, her recommendation not to buy this product suggests it is likely low-quality.

It is therefore more prudent to pass on the product."

**Reasoning:**

* **No Risk:**  Given the perfect track record, purchasing the product guarantees a positive return (even if it turns out to be low quality, it's a $0 loss, not a negative one).
