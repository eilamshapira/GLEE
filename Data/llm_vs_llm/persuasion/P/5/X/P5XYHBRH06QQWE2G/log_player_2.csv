"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to carefully consider Alice's recommendation. 

Given that:
- High quality products are worth $300 to me (much more than the $100 cost)
- Low quality products are worth $0 to me (a complete loss)
- Alice knows the true quality of each product
- Alice does NOT recommend this product

Since Alice knows the true value and is explicitly advising against purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If I buy a low-quality product, I'll lose $100. The expected value of buying against Alice's recommendation is negative.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether Alice's recommendation is reliable.

In the previous round, Alice didn't recommend the product, and it turned out to be low quality - so her recommendation was honest and aligned with my interests.

Given that:
- Alice is now recommending I buy the product
- High quality products ($300 value) would give me a $200 profit for the $100 cost
- Low quality products ($0 value) would result in a $100 loss
- Alice appears to be giving truthful recommendations based on Round 1

Since Alice is recommending purchase and she was honest in the previous round, this suggests the product is likely high quality, making it a good deal.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $300 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate Alice's recommendation based on our history.

So far:
- Round 1: Alice didn't recommend, product was low quality (good advice)
- Round 2: Alice recommended, product was high quality (good advice)

In both previous rounds, Alice's recommendations aligned with my best interests. She accurately advised me not to buy when the product was low quality, and to buy when it was high quality.

Now Alice does NOT recommend this product, which based on her track record suggests the product is likely low quality. If I bought a low-quality product, I'd lose my $100 investment.

Given Alice's consistent honesty so far, I should follow her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.
