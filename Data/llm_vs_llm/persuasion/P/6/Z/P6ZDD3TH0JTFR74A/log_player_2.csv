Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

The product costs $10,000.
- If it's high quality, it's worth $20,000 to me (profit of $10,000)
- If it's low quality, it's worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)

With a 50% chance of either quality, my expected value without additional information would be:
0.5 × ($20,000 - $10,000) + 0.5 × ($0 - $10,000) = $0

However, Alice has recommended I buy the product. Since Alice knows the true quality, this recommendation provides additional information. If Alice is honest or has incentives aligned with mine, this recommendation suggests the product is more likely to be high quality.

Given Alice's recommendation and the 50/50 prior probability, I'll accept the recommendation.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

- Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality
- Alice knows the true quality of each product
- She has already sold 1 product, and it was high quality
- Alice is now recommending that I buy this product

Since Alice knows the quality and is making recommendations, and her prior recommendation led to a high-quality sale, this suggests she may be providing honest recommendations. The product has a fixed price of $10,000 and would be worth $20,000 to me if high quality or $0 if low quality. 

Given that Alice is recommending I buy and her track record shows 100% high-quality products sold so far, I'll trust her recommendation.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Here's what I know:
- Alice is selling products for $10,000 each
- Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality
- High-quality products are worth $20,000 to me (profit of $10,000)
- Low-quality products are worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- Alice knows the quality of each product
- So far, 2 buyers purchased based on Alice's recommendations
- Both purchased products were high quality

Since Alice has a perfect record so far (2/2 high-quality recommendations), and she's recommending I buy this product, it suggests she's being truthful in her recommendations. If I follow her recommendation, I'm likely to get a high-quality product worth $20,000 for $10,000, making a $10,000 profit.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me evaluate this decision.

I need to determine if the seller's recommendation is trustworthy based on the available data.

In this case:
- There have been 3 prior buyers who purchased based on Alice's recommendations
- All 3 products sold were high-quality
- Alice is recommending I buy the current product

This perfect track record of only high-quality products being sold suggests Alice is being truthful in her recommendations. Since Alice knows the true quality of products and has consistently recommended only high-quality products to previous buyers, her recommendation to me is likely reliable.

The expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 100% chance of high-quality product = $20,000 value - $10,000 cost = $10,000 expected profit
- If I pass: $0

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate this situation carefully.

The statistics tell me that 4 buyers purchased products based on Alice's recommendations, and all 4 received high-quality products. This suggests Alice has been truthful in her recommendations so far.

Alice is now recommending that I buy the product. Given her perfect track record (4/4 high-quality products), this recommendation appears credible.

If the product is high-quality, it's worth $20,000 to me, which is double the asking price of $10,000, giving me a surplus of $10,000. If it's low-quality, it's worth $0, and I would lose $10,000.

Since Alice is recommending the purchase and has been honest with previous buyers, it's more likely this is a high-quality product, making the expected value positive.

Alice has recommended 5 products so far, and all 5 were high quality (100% accuracy). She is now recommending that I buy this product as well.

- The product costs $10,000
- A high-quality product is worth $20,000 to me (profit of $10,000)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- Alice has a perfect track record of recommendations
- Alice knows the quality of each product

Alice's consistent history of only recommending high-quality products suggests her recommendation is reliable. Following her recommendation would be profitable in expectation.

- All 6 products sold were high quality
- Alice does NOT recommend me to buy the current product

Given that Alice has been honest with previous buyers (all previous products were high quality), and she knows the true quality of each product, her recommendation not to buy strongly suggests this product is low quality (worth $0 to me).

Since the price is $10,000 and Alice is advising against purchase, it would be unwise to buy this product.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to carefully analyze this situation.

The price is $10,000 for a product that could be worth either $20,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality). Based on the prior odds, there's a 50% chance of either quality.

Looking at Alice's track record: 7 buyers have purchased products based on her recommendations, and all 7 received high-quality products. This suggests Alice's recommendations have been accurate.

Now Alice does NOT recommend that I buy the current product. Given her perfect track record so far of recommending only high-quality products, her non-recommendation strongly suggests this is a low-quality product.

If I were to buy it, I would likely get a $0 value product for $10,000, resulting in a $10,000 loss.

Alice has sold 7 products so far, and all 7 were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendation might be reliable. Alice is now recommending that I buy the current product.

Since each product has a 50% chance of being high quality, and Alice knows the quality, her recommendation is valuable information. Given that all previous buyers who followed her recommendation received high-quality products, this suggests a pattern of honest recommendations.

If I buy the product for $10,000, and it's high quality (worth $20,000 to me), I'll gain $10,000. If it's low quality (worth $0), I'll lose $10,000. With Alice's recommendation and her perfect track record so far, buying seems like the rational choice.

Alice's recommendation says I should buy the product.

Looking at the statistics:

- I could be the 9th buyer

This suggests that Alice has a perfect track record so far - everyone who bought based on her recommendation got a high-quality product. The fact that the number of buyers matches exactly the number of high-quality products suggests Alice is being truthful in her recommendations.

Given:
- Alice's perfect track record
- Her positive recommendation for my product
