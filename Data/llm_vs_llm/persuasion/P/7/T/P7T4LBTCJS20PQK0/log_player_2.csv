Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (80% chance): $40,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $40,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $32,000

Since the expected value ($32,000) is significantly higher than the price ($10,000), and Alice is recommending the purchase, this appears to be a good deal, even without any previous sales history.

1. Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($40,000) = $32,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $32,000

2. Cost = $10,000

3. Previous track record:
- One buyer before me
- One high-quality product sold
- This supports the stated 80% probability of high quality

4. Alice's recommendation:
- She recommends buying
- Her previous recommendation led to a successful high-quality sale

Given that:
- The expected value ($32,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($10,000)
- The previous sale was successful
- Alice's recommendation has proven reliable so far
- The stated probabilities are holding true

This appears to be a good investment opportunity.

1. Past performance:
- 2 buyers so far
- 2 high-quality products sold
- 100% success rate on previous sales

2. Economics:
- Cost: $10,000
- Value if high quality: $40,000 (80% chance)
- Value if low quality: $0 (20% chance)
- Expected value = (0.8 × $40,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $32,000

3. Considerations:
- Alice's recommendation is positive
- Previous track record is perfect
- Expected value ($32,000) is significantly higher than cost ($10,000)

Given the positive recommendation, perfect track record, and favorable expected value calculation, buying seems like a rational decision.

2. Track record:
- 3 buyers so far

3. Decision factors:
- Expected value ($32,000) > Price ($10,000)

4. Value if low quality: $0
5. Track record: 4 out of 4 products sold were high quality (100%)
6. Alice recommends buying

Expected value calculation:
* With 80% chance of high quality, and Alice's perfect track record plus positive recommendation, the probability of high quality is very favorable
* If high quality (very likely): Profit = $40,000 - $10,000 = $30,000
