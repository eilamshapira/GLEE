Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully:

- The product costs $1,000,000
- High-quality products are worth $2,000,000 to me (profit of $1,000,000)
- Low-quality products are worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000)
- There's an 80% chance of high quality and 20% chance of low quality
- Alice recommends buying the product
- There's no sales history yet to judge Alice's trustworthiness

The expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of $1,000,000 profit = $800,000
- 20% chance of $1,000,000 loss = -$200,000
- Net expected value = $600,000

Since the expected value is positive, even without knowing if Alice's recommendation is trustworthy, it makes sense to buy.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Given information:
- The price is $1,000,000
- High-quality product (80% chance) is worth $2,000,000 to me
- Low-quality product (20% chance) is worth $0 to me
- Alice recommends that I buy the product
- 1 previous buyer purchased based on Alice's recommendation
- 1 high-quality product has been sold so far

Based on the expected value calculation:
Expected value = (0.8 × $2,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) - $1,000,000 = $1,600,000 - $1,000,000 = $600,000

Additionally, Alice's previous recommendation resulted in a high-quality product sale, which suggests her recommendations may be reliable.

Given the positive expected value and Alice's track record of recommending a high-quality product previously, I'll purchase the product.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Alice, the seller, knows the true quality of each product. For this particular product, Alice does not recommend I buy it.

Given that:
- Alice has successfully sold 2 high-quality products already
- Alice knows the true value of each product to me
- For this product, Alice is specifically recommending against buying
- Alice's prior recommendations have resulted in 2 high-quality purchases

Alice's lack of recommendation is a strong signal that this product is likely low quality. Since a low-quality product is worth $0 to me but costs $1,000,000, following Alice's recommendation is the rational choice.

- The prior probability of a high-quality product is 80%
- Alice recommends I buy the product

- The fixed price is $1,000,000
- A high-quality product is worth $2,000,000 to me (profit of $1,000,000)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000)

The track record shows that Alice has been honest so far (2/2 high-quality products). Her recommendation to buy suggests the product is likely high-quality. With the prior probability of 80% and the additional positive signal from Alice's recommendation, it's rational to proceed with the purchase.

The expected value is positive: 0.8 × $1,000,000 - 0.2 × $1,000,000 = $600,000

- 3 previous buyers all purchased products based on Alice's recommendations
- All 3 products sold were high-quality
- Alice recommends I buy the current product

Expected value calculation:

Expected value = (Probability of high quality × Value of high quality) - Price
Expected value = (0.8 × $2,000,000) - $1,000,000 = $600,000

The expected value calculation:

Let me think about what I know:
- Products have an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $2M to me) and 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)
- Price is fixed at $1M
- 6 previous buyers purchased based on Alice's recommendations
- 4 high-quality products were sold (out of 6)
- Alice is recommending I buy this product

The expected value of a random product is: 0.8 × $2M + 0.2 × $0 = $1.6M, which exceeds the $1M cost.

However, I should also consider Alice's recommendation track record. She's sold 4 high-quality products out of 6 total sales, which is a 66.7% quality rate - lower than the baseline 80%. This suggests her recommendations might not be perfectly aligned with my interests.

Still, even with this track record, the expected value when Alice recommends buying would be: 0.667 × $2M + 0.333 × $0 = $1.33M, which still exceeds the $1M cost.

Given the positive expected value, I'll buy the product.

- 80% chance of high quality in general
- 8 previous buyers purchased based on Alice's recommendations

- Alice recommends I buy the product

Since Alice knows the quality and has recommended I buy, and her recommendations have led to a 75% success rate (close to the base rate of 80%), I will trust her recommendation.

The expected value calculation:
- 75% chance of profit ($1,000,000) = $750,000

- Price is $1,000,000
- 9 previous buyers purchased products

Expected value calculation:

- Alice's recommendation combined with prior information suggests this might be a high-quality product

If it's high-quality (worth $2M), I gain $1M by buying

Since Alice has sold 8 high-quality products out of 10 total sales (80%), this matches the prior probability distribution of product quality. Alice's recommendation provides some positive signal, though without knowing her recommendation strategy, I can't quantify exactly how much.

Given the expected value calculation:
0.8 × $1,000,000 (profit from high-quality) + 0.2 × (-$1,000,000) (loss from low-quality) = $600,000
