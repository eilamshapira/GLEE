"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While we don't know how much the high-quality product is worth to Bob, we know it's *at least* worth $10,000 to Alice since that's her selling price. Since there's an 80% chance of any product being high-quality, it's in Bob's best interest to buy, as the expected value of the purchase is positive."
"Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The outcome of the previous round provides no new information about the value of high-quality products to Bob. The same logic from the previous round applies: the expected value of purchasing is still positive."
"Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

"Bob bought the product!

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

We know that a low-quality product is worth less than $10,000 to Alice (otherwise she wouldn't be selling it). Since Bob doesn't know the quality of the product, he's taking a risk.  It's no longer a guaranteed positive expected value purchase. The recommendation is to avoid the purchase, as the risk of a loss outweighs the potential gain."
"Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's decision in the previous round gives us some new information. We know that a low-quality product is worth *less* to Bob than $10,000, otherwise he would have purchased it.  Since the current product is high-quality, it's still a good deal for Bob, even if the exact value to him is unknown. The expected value of purchasing is still positive."
