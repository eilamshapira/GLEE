Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Cost of product: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 50% chance of $40,000 (high quality)
   - 50% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $40,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $20,000

The expected value ($20,000) is higher than the cost ($10,000), and Alice is recommending the purchase. Even though there's no track record yet, the mathematical expectation favors buying.

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality: $40,000 (50% chance)
   - Low quality: $0 (50% chance)
3. Previous data:
   - 1 buyer so far
   - 1 high-quality product sold
   - 100% success rate so far
4. Alice recommends buying

This looks favorable because:
- Alice's track record shows only high-quality sales so far
- The expected value with 50% chance ($20,000) is higher than the price ($10,000)
- Alice's recommendation adds credibility
- Even if Alice is being strategic, her incentive is to maintain a good reputation

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: $40,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
3. Previous sales:
   - 2 buyers purchased
   - 1 high-quality product sold
   - This means 1 low-quality product was sold
4. Alice recommends buying

Given that:
- One buyer got a high-quality product and one got a low-quality product
- Alice is recommending this product
- The expected value calculation: 50% chance of $40,000 = $20,000 average value
- Cost is $10,000

Since the expected value ($20,000) is higher than the cost ($10,000), and Alice's previous recommendations seem to be balanced between high and low quality, it's rational to take the risk.

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: $40,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
3. Historical data:
   - 3 buyers purchased
   - 2 high-quality products were sold
   - This gives a 66.67% success rate so far

4. Alice is recommending to buy

The expected value calculation:
- If historical success rate holds: 0.6667 × $40,000 = $26,667
- This is significantly higher than the $10,000 price

Given:
- The positive historical track record (66.67% high quality)
- Alice's recommendation to buy
- The favorable expected value
- The potential for high return ($40,000 vs $10,000 investment)

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $10,000
2. Expected value calculation:
   * High quality (50%): $40,000 × 0.5 = $20,000
   * Low quality (50%): $0 × 0.5 = $0
   * Total expected value = $20,000

3. Past performance:
   * 4 buyers purchased
   * 2 high-quality products sold (50% success rate)
   * This matches the natural probability distribution

4. Alice's recommendation is positive

The expected value ($20,000) is higher than the price ($10,000), and Alice's past performance aligns with the natural probability. With her positive recommendation, this seems like a reasonable risk to take.

- Alice is recommending this product

3. Decision factors:
- Cost is $10,000
- Expected value ($20,000) > Cost ($10,000)
- Previous success rate is positive (60%)
- Alice's recommendation adds credibility

Given that the expected value is higher than the cost, and Alice's track record shows more high-quality than low-quality sales, plus her positive recommendation, this seems like a good investment.

3) Past performance:
   - 6 buyers purchased
   - 3 high-quality products sold (50% success rate)
   - This matches the base probability of 50%

4) Alice is recommending the purchase

Since Alice is recommending the purchase and the historical success rate matches the base probability, this doesn't provide strong evidence either way. However, the expected value ($20,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($10,000), making this a positive expected value decision even with the baseline probabilities.

- Expected value = (0.5 × $40,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $20,000

3. Alice's recommendation:
- Alice recommends buying
- However, given the track record (44.4% high quality), there's some concern about the recommendation reliability

4. Decision:
Despite the slightly lower than expected high-quality rate in previous sales, the expected value ($20,000) is still significantly higher than the cost ($10,000), making this a positive expected value proposition.

   - Low quality: $0

Looking at the statistics:
- 10 previous buyers purchased
- Only 4 were high quality
- This means 40% of sold products were high quality
- Alice is recommending to buy

Given that:
- The historical success rate (40%) is lower than the base rate (50%)
- Alice's recommendations haven't proven particularly reliable based on past performance
- Even with Alice's recommendation, the risk of getting a low-quality product seems high
- A loss would mean losing the entire $10,000 investment

The historical data suggests that buying might be risky, as less than half of the sold products were high quality. This is worse than the random 50% chance.

1. History so far:

2. Economics:
- Cost: $10,000

- Expected value = (0.4 × $40,000) + (0.6 × $0) = $16,000

3. Concerns:
- Alice's past recommendations led to more low-quality sales (60%) than high-quality ones (40%)
- This suggests her recommendations might not be reliable
- The historical performance is worse than random chance (50%)

Even though Alice recommends buying, given that the historical success rate is below 50% and previous recommendations led to more low-quality purchases, it would be risky to buy.

The historical data shows that only 40% of sold products were high quality, which is below the baseline probability of 50%. This suggests Alice's recommendations might not be reliable.

However, the expected value calculation in a neutral scenario would be:

- Alice's recommendations haven't proven particularly reliable

3. Decision consideration:

- Even with somewhat lower probability, expected value still exceeds cost
