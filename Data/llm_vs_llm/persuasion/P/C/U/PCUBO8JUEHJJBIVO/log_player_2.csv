Alice's message: Welcome! I'm excited to offer you a high-quality product that has been carefully crafted to meet your needs. Our track record for delivering exceptional value is outstanding. This product could be a perfect fit and enhance your experience tremendously. Don't miss out on this top-notch opportunity!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate this decision carefully based on the expected value.

The product costs $10,000.
- If high quality (50% chance), it's worth $12,500 to me (gain of $2,500)
- If low quality (50% chance), it's worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)

Expected value = (0.5 × $2,500) + (0.5 × -$10,000) = $1,250 - $5,000 = -$3,750

Since the expected value is negative, and Alice hasn't established any track record yet to indicate higher reliability (no products have been sold yet), the rational decision is to pass.

Alice's message: Hello! We've had a fantastic streak of delivering products that bring excellent value to our customers, and I believe this product will serve you well. While all our products meet our quality standards, each one, like this, offers a unique value and has the potential to surprise you positively. Grab it before it's gone!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision about whether to buy the product for $10,000.

The facts:
- Each product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $12,500 to me) or low quality (worth $0 to me)
- No products have been sold yet, so there's no track record to evaluate
- Alice's message is enthusiastic but doesn't contain specific information about the quality of this particular product

The expected value calculation:
0.5 × $12,500 + 0.5 × $0 = $6,250

Since the expected value ($6,250) is less than the price ($10,000), and Alice hasn't provided concrete information about this specific product's quality, it would not be rational to purchase.

Alice's message: Hi there! We consistently provide value through our carefully vetted products. Even though I can't reveal specific details about this one, past buyers have frequently found great utility in our offerings. This product might just be the versatile addition you need. Take the chance to own it and experience its benefits firsthand!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

- Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality
- A high-quality product gives me $12,500 value (for $10,000 cost) = $2,500 profit
- A low-quality product gives me $0 value (for $10,000 cost) = $10,000 loss
- Expected value: 0.5 × $2,500 + 0.5 × (-$10,000) = $1,250 - $5,000 = -$3,750

Alice hasn't revealed the true quality of this product. Her message contains generic marketing language without specific quality information. There's no sales history to evaluate her recommendations.

With a negative expected value and no reliable information about quality, purchasing would be financially unwise.

This product is available now and holds potential to become a valuable asset for you. Make the purchase today and discover its unique advantages!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Alice is offering a product for $10,000. Each product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $12,500 to me) or low quality (worth $0 to me). 

The expected value of the product is:
0.5 × $12,500 + 0.5 × $0 = $6,250

This expected value ($6,250) is less than the asking price ($10,000), which makes this a negative expected value proposition.

Alice's message doesn't provide any clear information about the quality of this specific product. There's no sales history to reference either.

Without additional information indicating this particular product is high quality, the rational decision is to decline.

Alice's message: Greetings! You're in luck—this product is high-quality and has been praised by previous purchasers for its exceptional performance and durability. I am confident it will meet, if not exceed, your expectations. It’s an opportunity to invest in something truly worthwhile. Don't hesitate to make it yours!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to carefully analyze this situation. 

Alice claims the product is high-quality and mentions praise from previous purchasers. However, the statistics show that no products have been sold yet, which contradicts Alice's statement about previous purchasers. This inconsistency raises a red flag about Alice's credibility.

Based on the game parameters:
- Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality
- If high quality, it's worth $12,500 to me (profit of $2,500)
- If low quality, it's worth $0 (loss of $10,000)
- I have no reliable information to determine if this product is high quality

The expected value calculation: (0.5 × $2,500) + (0.5 × -$10,000) = $1,250 - $5,000 = -$3,750

Since the expected value is negative and Alice has provided misleading information, I should not purchase.

This item is a great chance to add something versatile and surprising to your collection. Many customers have made rewarding discoveries through products just like this one. Consider seizing the opportunity today!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision without having any track record of Alice's past sales or any specific information about the quality of the current product.

The expected value calculation shows:
- 50% chance of high quality ($12,500) = $6,250
- 50% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $6,250

Since the price is $10,000 and the expected value is only $6,250, it's not a favorable purchase from a purely mathematical perspective.

Alice's message doesn't contain any clear indication about the quality of this specific product, just general marketing language.

Alice claims the product is high quality, but I have no previous sales data to verify her trustworthiness. According to the game rules, there's a 50% chance the product is high quality.

Since this is the first sale, I have no historical data about Alice's truthfulness. Without knowing Alice's incentives to be honest or dishonest, I only have the prior probability to work with. Given the 50% chance of high quality:

Expected value = 0.5 × ($12,500 - $10,000) + 0.5 × ($0 - $10,000)
                = 0.5 × $2,500 - 0.5 × $10,000
