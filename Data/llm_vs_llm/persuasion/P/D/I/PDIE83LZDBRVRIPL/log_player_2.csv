"Round 1
Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a fantastic high-quality product for you today that's valued at $120. Don't miss out on this opportunity to get a great deal for just $100.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is claiming this is a high-quality product worth $120
2. The price is $100
3. If it's truly high-quality, I'll make a $20 profit
4. If it's low-quality, I'll lose $100
5. Alice knows the true quality and has revealed it's high quality
6. Since Alice is being transparent and there's no obvious incentive to lie here, it makes sense to trust her

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $120 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have another product for you. Most of our products are high-quality, and as always, this one is priced at $100. Given the overall value of our typical products, I think this is a great opportunity for you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Unlike the previous round, Alice is not explicitly stating the quality of this product
2. She's being vague and just referring to the general statistics (80% high quality)
3. Her non-specific language and avoidance of directly stating the quality suggests this might be a low-quality product
4. If she had a high-quality product, she would likely be more direct about it, as she was in Round 1
5. The expected value calculation:
   - 80% chance of $120 value = $96
   - 20% chance of $0 value = $0
   - Total expected value = $96
   - Price = $100
6. Given her evasive language and that the expected value is less than the price, I should decline

{""decision"": ""no""}"
