"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze whether it's beneficial to buy the product based on the expected value.

Expected value calculation:
- If the product is high quality (80% chance): I get $3,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $2,000,000 profit
- If the product is low quality (20% chance): I lose $1,000,000

Expected value = (0.8 × $2,000,000) + (0.2 × -$1,000,000)
               = $1,600,000 - $200,000
               = $1,400,000

Since the expected value is positive and substantial, I should buy the product.

Expected value = (0.8 × $2,000,000) + (0.2 × -$1,000,000)
               = $1,600,000 - $200,000
