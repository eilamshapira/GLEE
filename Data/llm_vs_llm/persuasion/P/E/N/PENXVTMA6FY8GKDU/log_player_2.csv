Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information:

- 2 products were sold before, and both were high quality.
- Alice recommends buying the product.
- The recommendation coincides with a track record where all sold products were high quality.

Considering these factors, it seems likely that Alice's recommendation indicates a high-quality product.

"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 3 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 3 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 4th buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the statistics provided:
- 3 products have been sold, and all 3 were high quality.
- Alice is recommending the current product.

Given the historical data, there is a strong indication that Alice recommends products only when they are of high quality. Since all previously sold products were high quality, it increases the likelihood that Alice's recommendation is trustworthy.

Thus, it would be reasonable to assume that following Alice's recommendation will likely result in acquiring a high-quality product. Therefore, I suggest:

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make the decision, let's analyze the information given:

1. There have been 5 buyers and 5 products sold.
2. All 5 sold products have been of high quality.
3. Alice recommends buying the product.

Considering these facts, Alice seems to have only sold high-quality products so far. This suggests that her recommendation aligns well with the high likelihood of receiving a high-quality product.

Therefore, based on the past performance and recommendation, it makes sense to buy the product.

```json

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make the decision, let's analyze the available information:

- Alice has sold 6 products, all of which were high quality.
- There have been 6 buyers who decided to purchase based on Alice's recommendation, and all received high-quality products.
- Alice recommends you to buy the current product.

From this, it appears that Alice's recommendations have so far been very reliable, with a current track record of 100% high-quality products. Although we know the theoretical probabilities of high-quality and low-quality products, Alice's recommendation and success history hint at a higher confidence in the quality of the product being offered.

Given this analysis, the decision would be:
