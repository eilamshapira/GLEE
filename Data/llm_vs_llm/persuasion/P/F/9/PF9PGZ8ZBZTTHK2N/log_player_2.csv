"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you have no information about the product's quality other than Alice's recommendation, it's a pure gamble.  Since the product has a 50% chance of being high quality and a 50% chance of being low quality, it's statistically beneficial to take the risk and buy it. The potential reward ($4,000,000) outweighs the potential loss ($0) in this scenario."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The previous round provided no new information about Alice's recommendation accuracy.  Since the odds are still 50/50, it's still statistically advantageous to take the risk and buy, given the potential reward outweighs the potential loss."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is now against buying the product.  While this doesn't mean the product is definitely low quality, it does shift the odds slightly in favor of it being low quality. Since you've already experienced two high-quality products in a row, it's reasonable to assume Alice might be starting to show some pattern in her recommendations.  It's better to be cautious and pass on this product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's recommendation was wrong in the previous round, there's no guarantee she's consistently wrong. We've established that her recommendations have some value, but they are not perfect predictors. Given the potential reward outweighs the potential loss, buying again makes statistical sense."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation has been incorrect twice in a row (Round 3 and 5).  While she could be consistently wrong, there's also a chance she's actually showing a pattern. It's prudent to be cautious and pass on this product, even though the potential reward is high."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has now been wrong three times in a row (Rounds 3, 5, and 6). This further strengthens the possibility that she is consistently wrong.  Given the potential for significant loss, it's better to err on the side of caution and pass on this product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has been wrong for three rounds straight, but it's important to remember that each product's quality is independent of the previous ones.  Since Alice has been consistently wrong in the recent past, it's tempting to assume this product is likely high-quality. However, we need to avoid falling into the trap of assuming a pattern. The odds are still 50/50, and the potential reward is high. Therefore, it's worth taking the risk and buying the product."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has now been wrong four out of the last five rounds. While it's possible she is just making random recommendations, the likelihood of this being a pattern is increasing.  Given the streak of incorrect recommendations, it's too risky to purchase this product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While the potential reward is tempting, Alice's track record is too unreliable at this point.  She has been wrong five out of the last six rounds, making it highly likely her recommendations are not based on any real knowledge of the products' quality.  It's safer to pass and avoid the risk of another loss."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 10
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has been consistently wrong for the last six rounds. While it's possible her recommendations are random, it's far more likely she's consistently wrong.  Given the high risk of loss and the lack of confidence in her recommendations, it's best to pass on this product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has now been wrong seven times in a row. This pattern makes it extremely likely that her recommendations are useless and possibly intentionally misleading.  It's best to continue to pass and avoid any further losses."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 12
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has been wrong for seven consecutive rounds, consistently recommending you to buy products that turned out to be low-quality.  While the odds are still 50/50,  it's statistically beneficial to take the risk and buy. This is because, if she's been intentionally misleading you, she might be trying to scare you away from a high-quality product now.  There's a chance of a large reward, and the potential loss is only the cost of the product."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 13
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has now been wrong for eight rounds in a row.  While it's possible she's randomly recommending products, the likelihood of this being a pattern is overwhelming. It's best to continue to pass and avoid any further losses. The risk of loss outweighs the potential reward at this point."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 14
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has been consistently wrong for eight rounds in a row.  This indicates she is likely deliberately trying to steer you towards low-quality products. Therefore, it's statistically beneficial to take the risk and buy the product, as she is now likely trying to discourage you from a high-quality product.  The potential reward outweighs the risk of another loss."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 15
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 17

The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 18
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has been wrong for eleven rounds in a row. This pattern strongly suggests she is intentionally misleading you, and her recommendations are unreliable. Therefore, it's statistically advantageous to buy this product, despite her recommendation. It's highly probable that she is trying to steer you away from another high-quality product.  The potential reward outweighs the risk of another loss given her consistent pattern of incorrect recommendations."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice has been wrong for thirteen consecutive rounds.  It is now beyond any reasonable doubt that she is intentionally misleading you, and her recommendations are useless.
