Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since no products have been sold yet, there's no information to suggest the seller is biased or dishonest. The product has an 80% chance of being high quality, which means a potential profit of $1,000,000. While there is a 20% chance of losing the entire investment, the potential reward outweighs the risk. Furthermore, Alice's recommendation adds a slight level of confidence."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Prior Information:** The prior probability of a product being high quality is 80%.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which means she has seen something that makes her think this product is more likely high quality than low quality. 
* **Limited Data:** We have very limited data (only 1 prior sale), but the fact that the previous buyer purchased and it was high quality is a positive sign.

**Therefore, given the limited information, it's more likely that the product is high quality. The potential gain ($2,000,000) outweighs the potential loss ($1,000,000), so it's a reasonable gamble to buy.**"
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. Since she has access to the true quality of the product, this recommendation is a strong signal that it is likely high quality.
* **The statistics:** All products sold so far have been high quality. This further strengthens the belief that the current product is also high quality.
* **The potential payoff:**  A high-quality product is worth $2,000,000 to you.  Even if there's a chance it's low quality (20%), the potential reward outweighs the risk.

While there's always a risk, the information available suggests a high probability of the product being valuable."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 3 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 3 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 4th buyer!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who has no idea about the product's true value to you, is not recommending the purchase. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low-quality. 
* **Previous Sales:**  While the previous sales record shows a 100% success rate with high-quality products, this is a small sample size. It's possible Alice simply got lucky with the first three buyers.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward ($2,000,000) is high, but the risk of getting a worthless product ($0) is also significant. The odds are against you, and it's not worth the gamble."

{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since she has a perfect track record of recommending only high-quality products, and she's not recommending this one, it's likely to be low quality.  The price ($1,000,000) is far too high to justify the 20% risk of it being worthless."

* **100% Success Rate:** All 4 previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation received high-quality products. 
* **No Incentive to Lie:** Alice has no incentive to lie about the quality of the product. If she recommends a low-quality product, it will be discarded, meaning she loses a sale.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** All 9 previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation purchased high-quality products. This indicates a strong correlation between Alice's recommendations and the product quality.
* **No Information Loss:** You are not losing any information by buying. If the product is low-quality, you lose $1,000,000. If it's high-quality, you gain $1,000,000.
* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying is positive: (0.8 * $1,000,000) + (0.2 * -$1,000,000) = $600,000.

**Therefore, based on the available information, it's statistically advantageous to buy the product.**"

* **High Probability:** Even without Alice's recommendation, the base probability of a high-quality product is 80%, which is already quite high.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since all 12 previous buyers who purchased the product received a high-quality product, the probability of this product also being high-quality is very high. 

Here's why:

* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation, in this case, is a strong indicator. If she knew the product was low quality, she would likely advise against buying it, as she wouldn't want to lose future customers. 
* **Past Sales Record:** The perfect track record of high-quality products sold suggests a strong pattern. While it's possible that the initial 12 buyers were simply lucky, the odds of it continuing are very low. 

While there's still a 20% chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product significantly outweighs the risk."

The seller's track record is perfect. All 14 previous buyers who followed the recommendation received high-quality products. Since the seller has no incentive to lie, it's highly likely the current product is also high quality.
