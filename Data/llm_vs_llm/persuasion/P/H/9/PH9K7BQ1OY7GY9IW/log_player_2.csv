"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Expected Value:** Without a recommendation, the expected value of a product is 0.5 * $30,000 + 0.5 * $0 = $15,000.  
* **Price vs. Expected Value:** The price of $10,000 is less than the expected value of $15,000. However, Alice has provided no new information to suggest the product is more likely to be high quality. Her lack of recommendation suggests she might believe it's more likely to be low quality. 
* **Risk Aversion:** While the expected value is positive, there's a 50% chance of losing $10,000.  It's wiser to be slightly risk-averse in this scenario, especially since we'll have more information in future rounds."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice knows the true value of the product. Her recommendation to buy strongly suggests this round's product is high quality.  
* **Favorable Odds:** While there's still a chance the product is low quality, Alice's recommendation drastically changes the odds in our favor. It's reasonable to assume she's acting in her own best interest to maximize profit. Selling a high-quality product for $10,000 is better for her than it being thrown away.

Let's see what happens next!"
