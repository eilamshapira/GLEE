"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this strategically.

If Alice is being truthful, buying would be good. However, Alice has an incentive to recommend buying regardless of quality since she gets $1,000,000 either way.

Without any history to evaluate Alice's credibility, and given:
- 50% chance of high quality ($2M value)
- 50% chance of low quality ($0 value)
- Price is $1M
- Alice has incentive to always recommend buying

Expected value = (0.5 × $2M) + (0.5 × $0) = $1M

The expected value equals the price, so I'm indifferent. Given uncertainty about Alice's truthfulness, I'll be cautious.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is interesting. In Round 1, Alice was truthful in recommending a high-quality product.

Now in Round 2, Alice is NOT recommending the product, which is notable because:
1. Alice has a financial incentive to sell ($1M per sale)
2. Yet she's advising against buying
3. This suggests she might be building trust by being honest

If Alice is being truthful and strategic:
- Not recommending might indicate this is a low-quality product
- She might be establishing credibility for future rounds
- Her recommendation pattern suggests honesty

Given that:
1. Her first recommendation was honest
2. She's now recommending against her own financial interest
3. This strongly suggests the product is low quality

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is getting more interesting. Alice has shown a pattern of honesty:

Round 1: Recommended buying → Was high quality
Round 2: Recommended not buying → Was low quality
Round 3: Now recommending not buying

Analysis:
1. Alice appears to be building a reputation for honest recommendations
2. She could have tried to sell low-quality products but hasn't
3. She's consistently acting against her immediate financial interest when products are low quality
4. This suggests she's playing a long-term strategy focused on trust

Given that:
- Her recommendations have been 100% accurate so far
- She's again recommending against buying
- She's proven willing to forgo profit on low-quality items
- She's building credibility

I'll continue to trust her recommendation.
