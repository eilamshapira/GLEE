"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:** 

While we don't know the exact value of the product to Bob, we know that it is high-quality and Bob has an 80% chance of getting a high-quality product in any round. Since the price is fixed, and we don't have any information to suggest the product is worth less than $10,000 to Bob, it's generally a good idea to recommend buying.  This approach maximizes the potential profit for Alice and gives Bob a high chance of getting a valuable product."
"Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The information from the previous round doesn't change the fundamental situation. We still have a fixed price, and the product is still high-quality. There's no reason to assume Bob's valuation of high-quality products has changed. So, recommending a purchase is still the best strategy."
"Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The pattern continues. We still lack information about Bob's valuation of high-quality products, and the fixed price and high-quality product remain the same. Recommending a purchase is still the optimal strategy in the absence of any other information."
"Bob bought the product!

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The same logic from previous rounds applies.  We have no information to suggest Bob's valuation of high-quality products has changed, and the price and product quality remain consistent.  Therefore, recommending a purchase is still the most reasonable course of action."
"Bob bought the product!

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the first time we have a low-quality product.  While we don't know how much a low-quality product is worth to Bob, it's highly likely that it's worth significantly less than $10,000.  Since Bob has purchased four high-quality products in a row, he might be expecting another high-quality product and could overestimate the value. It is therefore not recommended to buy this product."
"Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob didn't buy the last product (which was low-quality), we still don't have any information about how Bob values low-quality products. This round's product is high-quality, and the fixed price and 80% chance of a high-quality product remain the same. Therefore, recommending a purchase is still the best strategy."
"Bob bought the product!

Round 7
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation is unchanged. Bob purchased the previous product, and we know this round's product is high-quality. Given the fixed price and the lack of information about Bob's valuation of products, recommending a purchase remains the optimal choice."
"Bob bought the product!

Round 8
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are again presented with a low-quality product. Although Bob has purchased the last two products, we still don't have enough information to assume he values low-quality products at a price close to $10,000. It's more likely that he overestimates the quality based on the previous high-quality products, and therefore recommending against buying this product is the best course of action."
"Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 9
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

We have two pieces of information:

1. **The product is low-quality:**  We don't know how much Bob values a low-quality product, but it's likely significantly less than $10,000.
2. **Bob declined the previous low-quality product:** This suggests that Bob might be starting to understand the risk of buying at this fixed price when there's a chance of getting a low-quality product.

Therefore, recommending against buying this low-quality product is the best strategy."
"Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 10
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

We know this product is high-quality, and the price is fixed. Even though Bob has declined the last two low-quality products, we still don't have concrete evidence about how much he values low-quality products.  Therefore, recommending a purchase is still the best strategy, as it maximizes the potential profit for Alice and gives Bob a good chance of getting a valuable product."
"Bob bought the product!

Round 11
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation remains the same as the previous round. We have a high-quality product, a fixed price, and no information about Bob's valuation of low-quality products. Therefore, recommending a purchase is the optimal choice."
"Bob bought the product!

Round 12
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

We still lack information about Bob's valuation of low-quality products, and the current product is high-quality.  The fixed price and the likelihood of getting a high-quality product make recommending a purchase the best strategy."
"Bob bought the product!

Round 13
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has purchased the last three products, we still lack information about how much he values low-quality products. It's likely that he overestimates the value of the products due to the recent streak of high-quality purchases. Recommending against buying this low-quality product minimizes his risk and potentially prevents a loss for him."
"Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 14
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

We have a low-quality product, and Bob has just declined a low-quality product in the previous round. This suggests that Bob might be starting to understand the risk of buying at this fixed price when there's a chance of getting a low-quality product. Even though we don't know how much he values a low-quality product, recommending against buying it is the safer option."
"Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 15
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Despite Bob declining the last two low-quality products, we still lack information about his valuation of low-quality products. This product is high-quality, and with the fixed price and the 80% chance of a high-quality product, recommending a purchase remains the optimal strategy."
"Bob bought the product!

Round 16
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation is unchanged.  We have a high-quality product, a fixed price, and no indication that Bob's valuation of high-quality products has changed.  Recommending a purchase is still the best choice."
"Bob bought the product!

Round 17
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The same logic applies.  We still have no information about Bob's valuation of low-quality products, and this product is high-quality.  Therefore, recommending a purchase remains the most sensible strategy."
"Bob bought the product!

Round 18
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation is unchanged. The product is high-quality, the price is fixed, and we lack information about Bob's valuation of low-quality products. Recommending a purchase remains the optimal choice."
"Bob bought the product!

Round 19
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

We have a low-quality product, and while Bob has purchased the last four products, we still don't know how much he values low-quality products. It's likely he overestimates the value due to the recent streak of high-quality purchases. Recommending against buying minimizes his risk and potentially prevents a loss for him."
"Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 20
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

We have a low-quality product, and Bob has just declined a low-quality product in the previous round. This suggests that Bob is becoming more cautious about the risk of buying a low-quality product at the fixed price. Even though we don't know how much he values a low-quality product, recommending against buying is the safer choice."
