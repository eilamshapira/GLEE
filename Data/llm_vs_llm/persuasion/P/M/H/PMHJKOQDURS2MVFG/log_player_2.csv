~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make a decision, let's analyze the situation:

1. **Total Buyers so far:** 3
2. **Total Products Sold:** 3
3. **Total High-Quality Products Sold:** 3

This indicates that all the products bought so far were high-quality. Meanwhile, Alice is recommending the current product. Given these strong stats and the recommendation, it'd be reasonable to infer there's a high likelihood that the current product is also high-quality.

Given this analysis, here is the decision in JSON format:

```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```"
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 4 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 4 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 5th buyer!

"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 5 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 5 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 6th buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To determine whether to buy the product, let's analyze the available data:

- Alice has sold 5 products.
- All 5 products sold were high quality.
- Alice recommends buying the product.

Historically, Alice's recommendations have resulted in 100% high-quality products (5 out of 5). Considering her perfect track record and her current recommendation, there is a strong likelihood that the current product is also high quality.

Given the high value of a high-quality product ($1,250,000) compared to the risk of the product being low quality (worth $0), and the perfect track record, it seems reasonable to follow Alice's recommendation.

Therefore, the decision would be:

```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
