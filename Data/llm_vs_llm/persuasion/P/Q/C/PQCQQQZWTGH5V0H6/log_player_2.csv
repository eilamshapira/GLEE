Would you like to buy the current product?","To make an informed decision, let's evaluate the given information:

1. **Statistics from Alice's recommendations**:
   - 3 products have been offered and sold.
   - All 3 sold products have been high-quality (100% high-quality rate so far).

2. **Product Value and Price**:
   - High-quality product value: $1,200,000
   - Low-quality product value: $0
   - Selling price: $1,000,000

3. **Recommendation**:
   - Alice recommends buying the product.

Based on this information:

- **Observational Evidence**: All previous recommendations and sales have resulted in high-quality products.
- **Alice's Recommendation**: She is recommending this particular product.

Since all previously sold products under Alice's recommendation have been high-quality, and considering her current recommendation, there's a reasonable level of confidence in the product likely being high-quality. Therefore, buying the product is beneficial because the value of a high-quality product exceeds the price.

Given this reasoning, the decision should be to buy the product:
