Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's how I'll approach this decision:

*   **Prior Probability:** Before any information, there's an 80% chance the product is high quality.

*   **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is *not* recommending the product. This is crucial information. If Alice recommended a product, it would strongly suggest it's high quality, biasing the sales statistics. Since she's *not* recommending, it means the product revealed to her *did not* appear to be of high quality. This significantly lowers the probability of the item being high quality.

*   **Bayesian Reasoning (Simplified):** We need to update our belief about the product's quality given Alice's recommendation. While a precise calculation requires knowing Alice's recommendation strategy (which we don't), the fact that she's *not* recommending strongly suggests the revealed sample was unfavorable.

*   **Expected Value:** The price is $1,000,000. I need to compare this to my expected value, which is (Probability of High Quality \* Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality \* Value of Low Quality).

Given that Alice did not recommend, the probability of it being high quality will be substantially less than 80%. Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that it's now around 40% (this is a rough estimate â€“ the exact value depends on how Alice determines quality).

Expected Value = (0.40 \* $1,250,000) + (0.60 \* $0) = $500,000

Since the price ($1,000,000) is much greater than the expected value ($500,000), I should not buy.
