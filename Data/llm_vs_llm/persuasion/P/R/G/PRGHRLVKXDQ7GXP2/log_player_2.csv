Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my reasoning:

*   **Prior Probability:** Initially, the probability of a high-quality product is 80% and low quality is 20%.

*   **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying. Since Alice knows the quality and the recommendation is to buy, it strongly suggests the product is high quality.

*   **Expected Value:**

    *   If I buy: I'm betting that the product is of high quality. If it is of high quality, it's worth $2,000,000 to me, and I pay $1,000,000, for a net gain of $1,000,000. If it is low quality, it's worth $0 to me, and I pay $1,000,000 for a net loss of $1,000,000. Given Alice's recommendation, the probability of it being high quality is significantly higher than the initial 80%.

    *   If I don't buy: The product is discarded, and I get nothing.

*   **Conclusion:** Since Alice recommends buying, I believe the probability that the product is high quality is high enough to justify the purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my reasoning:

*   **Prior Probability:** Initially, the probability of a high-quality product is 80%.
*   **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. This is a strong signal, but it's important to consider Alice's incentives.
*   **Observed Sales Record:** 12 high-quality products have been sold out of potentially many offers. This suggests that Alice is likely recommending high-quality items.

Since the expected value of buying, given Alice's recommendation and the sales history, is likely higher than the price, I will buy.
