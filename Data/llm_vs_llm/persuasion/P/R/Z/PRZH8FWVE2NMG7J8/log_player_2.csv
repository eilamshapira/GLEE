Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   * High quality (80% chance): $12,000
   * Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
* (0.80 × $12,000) + (0.20 × $0) = $9,600

While Alice recommends buying the product, there's no track record yet to assess her trustworthiness. Based purely on probability:
* The expected value ($9,600) is less than the price ($10,000)
* This means on average, I would lose $400 per transaction

1. Product price: $10,000
2. Expected value calculation:
   * 80% chance of high quality ($12,000) = $9,600
   * 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
   * Total expected value = $9,600

3. Considering:
   * No sales history to reference
   * Alice recommends buying
   * Expected value ($9,600) is less than price ($10,000)
   * Risk of complete loss if product is low quality

Given that the expected value is less than the asking price, and there's no track record to validate Alice's recommendation, it would be financially prudent to decline.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Prior probabilities:
- 80% chance of high quality ($12,000 value)
- 20% chance of low quality ($0 value)
- Price is $10,000

2. Key points:
- Alice does not recommend buying
- No previous sales history to reference
- Alice knows the true quality and chose to not recommend

Since Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase, this is a strong signal that the product might be low quality. If it was high quality, she would likely recommend it to make the sale.

Given this negative recommendation, the probability of the product being low quality is likely higher than the base 20%.

Expected value would be lower than:
(0.8 × $12,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $9,600

Since the expected value is less than the $10,000 price, I should not buy.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze this situation:

1. Base probability:
- 80% chance of high quality ($12,000 value)
- 20% chance of low quality ($0 value)
- Price is $10,000

2. Seller's recommendation:
- Alice does NOT recommend buying
- As a rational seller, Alice would want to sell any high-quality product
- The negative recommendation likely indicates this is a low-quality product
- This significantly increases the probability that this is a low-quality product

3. Expected value calculation with seller's recommendation:
- Given the negative recommendation, the probability of low quality is very high
- If this is a low-quality product, I would lose $10,000
- The risk is too high given the seller's recommendation

Given this analysis, especially considering the seller's negative recommendation, I should not buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Price is $10,000
2. If high quality (80% chance), value is $12,000 (profit of $2,000)
3. If low quality (20% chance), value is $0 (loss of $10,000)
4. Alice does not recommend buying
5. No prior sales history to reference

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of $12,000 = $9,600
- 20% chance of $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $9,600

The expected value ($9,600) is less than the price ($10,000), and Alice's negative recommendation likely indicates she knows it's low quality. The risk of a $10,000 loss is too high.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Value: $12,000 if high quality, $0 if low quality
3. Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
4. Alice doesn't recommend buying
5. No previous sales history to reference

The seller has no incentive to recommend against buying unless the product is actually low quality, as they want to make sales. Since Alice doesn't recommend buying, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. 

Therefore, I should trust Alice's recommendation since it goes against her own interests to make a sale.
