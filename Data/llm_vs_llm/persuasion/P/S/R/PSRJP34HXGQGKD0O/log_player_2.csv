{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since there is no prior information on product quality, the recommendation from Alice and the 50/50 chance of a high-quality product make buying the product a worthwhile gamble. The potential gain of $10,000 outweighs the potential loss of $10,000."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:**  You only have the seller's recommendation and one data point from a previous buyer. There's not enough information to make a definitive judgment.
* **Seller Incentive:**  The seller has an incentive to recommend the product, even if it's low quality.  This doesn't mean the recommendation is false, but it should be considered.
* **Potential Upside:**  A high-quality product is worth twice the price, offering a significant potential profit. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Given the 50/50 odds and the potential for a large profit, the risk of buying is outweighed by the potential reward.

**Conclusion:** While there's a risk of buying a low-quality product, the chance of getting a high-quality product at a good price makes buying the product the best decision in this scenario."

Here's why:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice doesn't recommend buying the product. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. 
* **Previous Sales:**  While 100% of the products sold so far were high quality, this is a very small sample size. It's possible the previous buyers simply got lucky. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward ($20,000) is significant, but the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0 value) is also high. Given Alice's lack of recommendation, it's wiser to pass."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who has access to the actual quality, is not recommending the product. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low-quality.
* **Previous Sales:**  The sales history shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products. This suggests that Alice is being truthful in her recommendations. 
* **Risk:** Given the low potential reward ($0 for a low-quality product) and the high risk (50% chance of being low-quality), it's best to pass."

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Record:**  The sales record shows that all products sold so far have been high-quality. This is a strong indicator that Alice has an excellent ability to identify high-quality products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending you buy the product.  Since she has a perfect track record, her recommendation is very valuable.

**Conclusion:** Given the perfect sales record and Alice's positive recommendation, it's highly likely the product is high-quality.  Therefore, the decision is to buy."

Here's the reasoning:

* **Alice's track record:**  Alice has a 100% success rate with recommending products. Every product she recommended was high quality.
* **Alice's current recommendation:** Alice is not recommending the current product. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** You have no information about the current product.  There's a 50% chance it's worth $20,000 and a 50% chance it's worthless.  Since Alice's recommendation is a strong indicator, and the potential loss is significant, it's better to pass."

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since she knows the quality of the product, her recommendation carries significant weight.  Even though the statistics show a high proportion of high-quality products sold, the fact that Alice is not recommending the product makes it highly likely that it's low-quality."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has a 100% success rate in recommending products. This means she perfectly identifies high-quality products. Since she is not recommending the current product, it is highly likely to be low-quality."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who has seen the product's quality, is not recommending it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. 
* **Previous Sales:**  The fact that all 5 previous buyers who purchased based on Alice's recommendation received high-quality products is a strong indicator that Alice is a reliable source. This makes her negative recommendation even more significant. 

It's a risky bet to go against Alice's recommendation in this scenario.  The potential reward (a high-quality product) is outweighed by the risk of getting a worthless low-quality product."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has a perfect track record so far, selling only high-quality products.  Since she's not recommending this product, it strongly suggests it's low quality. Given the 50/50 odds, it's more likely to be a bad purchase."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice is not recommending the product, which is a strong signal that it might be low quality.
* **Statistics:**  All previous buyers who purchased the product received a high-quality item. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are accurate, and the product being offered is likely low quality.
* **Risk:** Since a low-quality product is worth $0 to you, the potential loss is significant.  It's better to err on the side of caution and pass."
