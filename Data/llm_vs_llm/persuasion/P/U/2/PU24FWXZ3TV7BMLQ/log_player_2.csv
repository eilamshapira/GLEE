Alice recommends you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since there's no historical data, the recommendation from Alice is the only information we have.  While Alice has an incentive to recommend the product, the odds are 50/50.  The potential gain of $2,500 (the difference between the value of a high-quality product and the price) outweighs the potential loss of $10,000."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the previous buyer purchased the product and it was high quality, it suggests that Alice is likely recommending high-quality products. Even though the odds of a high-quality product are 50%, the seller's recommendation provides additional information that favors buying.  The potential reward of $12,500 outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product and losing $10,000."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommends buying, which is a strong signal. While her incentive is to sell, she knows the value you place on a high-quality product. 
* **Previous Sales:** 100% of the products sold so far were high quality. This is a very strong indicator that Alice is preferentially recommending high-quality items.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a 50% chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward of $12,500 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000. 

Given the information available, buying the product is the more logical choice."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:** Alice has a 100% success rate in recommending high-quality products.
* **Value Proposition:** Even though the price is $10,000, the product is worth $12,500 to you if it's high quality. 
* **No Risk:** You know Alice is recommending a high-quality product, so you have no risk of buying a worthless product. 

Therefore, it's highly likely the product Alice is recommending is high quality, making it a profitable purchase."

~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since she knows the true value of the product, her recommendation not to buy suggests the product is likely low quality.  While the sales record shows a high proportion of high-quality products sold, it's not a guarantee that this product is also high quality.  It's better to pass on the product and avoid the risk of getting a worthless product."

~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice knows the true quality of each product and her recommendation is based on that knowledge, her not recommending the product means it's likely a low-quality product. 

Even though the sales record shows a high proportion of high-quality products sold, it's important to note that:

1. **The sample size is small:** 5 sales is not a large enough sample to draw definitive conclusions. 
2. **Alice's recommendations influence the sales:** It's possible she recommended only high-quality products to the previous buyers, which skewed the sales record.

Therefore, based on Alice's recommendation and the uncertainty surrounding the quality of the current product, it's wiser to pass."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice knows the true quality of the product and recommends buying it.  This is strong evidence that the product is high quality.
* **Perfect Track Record:**  All 5 previous products sold were high-quality. This further reinforces the likelihood of the current product also being high-quality.

**While there is still a 50% chance of the product being low-quality, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests it's high-quality. The potential reward of $12,500 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000.**"

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation, combined with the fact that all 11 previously sold products were high quality, strongly suggests that the current product is also high quality.
