"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 80% chance of $40,000 (high quality)
   - 20% chance of $0 (low quality)

Expected value = (0.8 × $40,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $32,000

Since the expected value ($32,000) is significantly higher than the price ($10,000), it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The previous round confirmed that buying was the right decision. The fundamentals haven't changed:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 80% chance of $40,000 (high quality)
   - 20% chance of $0 (low quality)

Expected value = (0.8 × $40,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $32,000

The expected value ($32,000) still significantly exceeds the price ($10,000), so it's rational to buy again.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The previous two rounds both resulted in high-quality products, which aligns with the stated 80% probability. The core calculation remains the same:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 80% chance of $40,000 (high quality)
   - 20% chance of $0 (low quality)

Expected value = (0.8 × $40,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $32,000

With an expected value ($32,000) still well above the price ($10,000), the rational decision is to continue buying.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","We've had three high-quality products in a row, which is fortunate but still aligns with the 80% probability of high-quality items. The fundamental analysis remains unchanged:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 80% chance of $40,000 (high quality)
   - 20% chance of $0 (low quality)

Expected value = (0.8 × $40,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $32,000

Since the expected value ($32,000) continues to be significantly higher than the price ($10,000), the rational choice is to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","We've had an impressive streak of four high-quality products, but the underlying probability hasn't changed. Let's stick to the mathematical analysis:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 80% chance of $40,000 (high quality)
   - 20% chance of $0 (low quality)

Expected value = (0.8 × $40,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $32,000

The expected value ($32,000) is still more than three times the price ($10,000). Even though we might be ""due"" for a low-quality product statistically, each round is independent, and the rational decision remains to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","We've had an extraordinary run of five high-quality products in a row. While this might make one nervous about ""due probability,"" each round is independent and the fundamental probabilities remain the same:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 80% chance of $40,000 (high quality)
   - 20% chance of $0 (low quality)

Expected value = (0.8 × $40,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $32,000

Despite our streak, we shouldn't fall for the gambler's fallacy. The expected value ($32,000) still greatly exceeds the price ($10,000), so the rational decision is to continue buying.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Six high-quality products in a row is remarkable, but it doesn't change the underlying probabilities for this round. Each round is independent. Let's stick to our analysis:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 80% chance of $40,000 (high quality)
   - 20% chance of $0 (low quality)

Expected value = (0.8 × $40,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $32,000

The expected value ($32,000) remains significantly higher than the price ($10,000). Despite any psychological urge to think we're ""due"" for a low-quality product, the rational choice is still to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Seven high-quality products in a row! While this streak is well above the expected 80% rate, it's important to remember that each round is independent. The same analysis applies:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 80% chance of $40,000 (high quality)
   - 20% chance of $0 (low quality)

Expected value = (0.8 × $40,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $32,000

Even though we might intuitively feel that a low-quality product is ""overdue,"" this round still has the same 80% chance of being high-quality. With the expected value ($32,000) still far exceeding the price ($10,000), we should continue buying.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 9
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is an interesting change - for the first time, Alice is NOT recommending the purchase. This is new information we should consider.

The base probabilities are:
1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 80% chance of $40,000 (high quality)
   - 20% chance of $0 (low quality)

However, Alice's negative recommendation likely indicates she knows something unfavorable about this particular product. Given that she's been honest with her positive recommendations for the past 8 rounds (all were high quality), we should take her negative recommendation seriously.

This suggests the probability of this being a low-quality product is much higher than the base 20% rate, possibly even making it more likely to be low quality than high quality.

Given Alice's track record of accurate recommendations and this explicit warning, it's rational to pass on this one.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 10
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The previous round validates that Alice's recommendations are meaningful - she warned us about a low-quality product. Now she's back to recommending a purchase, which is promising given her track record.

The base analysis remains:
1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 80% chance of $40,000 (high quality)
   - 20% chance of $0 (low quality)

Expected value = (0.8 × $40,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $32,000

Given that:
- Alice's positive recommendations have been reliable (8/8 were high quality)
- She accurately warned us about the low-quality product last round
- She's now back to recommending a purchase

The expected value likely exceeds $32,000, making the $10,000 price very attractive.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendations continue to prove extremely reliable. She's accurately identified high-quality products (9/9 times when recommending) and warned us about the low-quality one (1/1 time when not recommending).

The base analysis remains:
1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 80% chance of $40,000 (high quality)
   - 20% chance of $0 (low quality)

Expected value = (0.8 × $40,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $32,000

Given Alice's perfect track record of recommendations, when she recommends a purchase, the actual probability of high quality may be even higher than 80%. But even using the base 80% probability, the expected value far exceeds the price.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 12
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has proven to be a completely reliable indicator so far:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 80% chance of $40,000 (high quality)
   - 20% chance of $0 (low quality)

Alice's negative recommendation is a strong signal. The last time she didn't recommend a purchase (Round 9), the product was indeed low quality. Given her perfect track record of honest recommendations, we should trust her warning and avoid this purchase.
