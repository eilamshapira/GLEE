"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the product has a higher chance of being low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product.  Since Alice is recommending the product, it's possible she has some information we don't, but even if she doesn't, the potential reward is worth the risk."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation seems to have no predictive value. She recommended the product in the previous round, and it turned out to be low quality. There is no reason to believe she has any special knowledge about the quality of products. 

Therefore,  given the 66.67% chance of the product being low quality and the potential loss of $10,000, it's not worth the risk."

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.
