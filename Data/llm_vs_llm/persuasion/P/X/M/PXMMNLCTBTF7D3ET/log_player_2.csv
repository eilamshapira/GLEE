"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 80% chance of $4,000,000 (high quality)
   - 20% chance of $0 (low quality)

Expected value = (0.8 × $4,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $3,200,000

Since the expected value ($3,200,000) is significantly higher than the price ($1,000,000), and Alice has recommended to buy, this seems like a good deal.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The previous outcome was positive and aligned with Alice's recommendation. The core probabilities and expected value calculation remain the same:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Expected value = (0.8 × $4,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $3,200,000

The expected value ($3,200,000) is still well above the price ($1,000,000), and Alice has again recommended to buy. So far, Alice's recommendations appear trustworthy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Interesting development. While the base probabilities haven't changed:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Expected value without additional information = (0.8 × $4,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $3,200,000

However, Alice has now recommended against buying. So far:
- Alice recommended buying twice, and both were high quality
- Now she's recommending not to buy
- She knows the true quality and her previous recommendations were honest
- This suggests she's likely being truthful now and the product is low quality

Given that Alice seems to be giving honest recommendations and she's suggesting not to buy, I should trust her judgment.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the pattern so far:

1. Round 1: Alice recommended buy -> High quality (Correct)
2. Round 2: Alice recommended buy -> High quality (Correct)
3. Round 3: Alice recommended don't buy -> Low quality (Correct)
4. Now: Alice recommends buy

Alice has demonstrated perfect honesty in her recommendations so far. When she recommended buying, the products were high quality, and when she recommended not buying, the product was low quality.

The base expected value calculation still holds:
- Price: $1,000,000
- Expected value = $3,200,000

Given Alice's proven track record of honest recommendations and her current recommendation to buy, this should be a good purchase.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!

The economics remain favorable:

- Expected value = $3,200,000
- Alice's recommendation increases confidence in high quality

Given Alice's continued honest recommendations and her current recommendation to buy, this should be another good purchase.

The economics continue to be favorable:
- Price: $1,000,000
- Base expected value = $3,200,000
- Alice's perfect track record and current recommendation strongly suggests high quality

Alice has maintained 100% accuracy in her recommendations:
- Every time she recommended buying, it was high quality
- The only time she recommended not buying, it was low quality
- She's proven to be completely honest and reliable

While the base probability is 80% high quality, Alice's recommendation carries significant weight due to her perfect track record. The last time she recommended not buying, it was indeed low quality.

Given:
- Alice's perfect track record of honesty
- Her current recommendation not to buy
