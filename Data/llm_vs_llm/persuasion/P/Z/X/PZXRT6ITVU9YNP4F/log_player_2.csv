Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make an informed decision, let's consider the expected value of buying the product.

- If the product is high-quality (33.33% chance), it's worth $30,000 to you.
- If the product is low-quality (66.67% chance), it's worth $0 to you.

The expected value (EV) of buying the product is:
EV = (0.3333 * $30,000) + (0.6667 * $0) = $10,000

Since the expected value matches the price Alice is offering, this is a fair bet. However, given Alice's recommendation, we might infer that she believes this product is of high quality. Therefore, it might be worth the risk.
