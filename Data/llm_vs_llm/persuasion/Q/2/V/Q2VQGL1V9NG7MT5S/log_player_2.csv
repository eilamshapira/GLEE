"Round 1
Alice's message: I understand this is a significant investment, Bob.  To assure you of the value of this product, I'm offering you a special guarantee for this round. If you purchase this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I will personally reimburse you the full $1000000 in the next round. This demonstrates my confidence in the quality of this particular item.  Consider the potential return: a high-quality product is worth $4000000 to you.  Given the 80% chance of it being high-quality, and my guarantee removing the risk of the 20% chance of it being low-quality, this is a statistically sound investment.
