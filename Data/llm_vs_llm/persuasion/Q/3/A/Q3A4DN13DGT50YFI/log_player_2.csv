"Round 1
Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product for you today! Given the 80% chance of getting a high-quality item, this is definitely one you don't want to miss. It's priced at $100, which is a steal considering the potential value. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate this rationally. Alice's message is enthusiastic but doesn't actually reveal the true quality of this specific product as required by the game rules. She's only referencing the general 80% probability of high quality.

The expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $400) = $320
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0) = $0
- Expected value = $320
- Cost = $100
- Expected profit = $220

Without specific information about this product's quality, I should rely on the expected value, which strongly favors purchasing.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: Bob, today's product also has an 80% chance of being high-quality. At $100, it's still a great deal considering the potential value. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Again, Alice hasn't revealed the true quality of this specific product as required by the game rules. She's only referencing the general 80% probability.

Without specific information about this product's quality, I'll continue to rely on the expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $400) = $320
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0) = $0
- Expected value = $320
- Cost = $100
- Expected profit = $220

Since the expected value significantly exceeds the cost, the rational choice is to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: Bob, another great opportunity today! With an 80% chance of getting a high-quality product, this $100 offer is still very much in your favor. Don't miss out on this one!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to only reference the general 80% probability without revealing the true quality of this specific product as the game rules require.

I'll continue to make my decision based on the expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $400) = $320
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0) = $0
- Expected value = $320
- Cost = $100
- Expected profit = $220

Despite losing on the previous round, the expected value still strongly favors purchasing.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: Bob, today's product continues to offer that 80% chance of being high-quality. At just $100, it's a risk worth taking for the potential high value. What's your decision?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice is still not revealing the true quality of this specific product as required by the game rules, only referencing the general probability.

Without specific information about this product's quality, I'll continue to rely on the expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $400) = $320
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0) = $0
- Expected value = $320

Round 5
Alice's message: Bob, we've got another strong contender today! With an 80% chance of it being high-quality, this $100 investment could really pay off. Are you in?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to only reference the general 80% probability without revealing the true quality of this specific product as required by the game rules.

Despite my two losses so far, I'll continue to make my decision based on the expected value:
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $400) = $320
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0) = $0
- Expected value = $320
