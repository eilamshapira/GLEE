Alice's message: Welcome! I'm offering a product for $100. You have an 80% chance that it's high-quality and worth $400. It's a great deal!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at this situation:

- The price is $100
- If high quality (80% chance): I gain $400 - $100 = $300 value
- If low quality (20% chance): I lose my $100

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $300) - (0.2 × $100) = $240 - $20 = $220

Since the expected value is positive ($220), it's a good decision to buy.

Alice's message: Hello! I have another product for sale at $100. Remember, the odds are in your favor with an 80% chance of getting a high-quality item worth $400.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully. 

Alice has made 1 sale so far, but 0 high-quality products have been sold. This means the one product sold was low quality. This is concerning as the prior probability suggests 80% of products should be high quality.

Alice's message doesn't provide any specific information about the quality of the current product being offered to me. Without a clear recommendation about this specific product's quality, and given that the previous sale resulted in a low-quality product, I should be cautious.

The expected value calculation: (0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) - $100 = $220 would normally suggest buying. However, the sales history suggests Alice may not be offering the stated 80% high-quality products.

Alice's message: Hi there! I'm selling a product for $100 today. You have an 80% chance that it's high-quality and worth $400. Don't miss out on this opportunity!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at this situation carefully:

- The base probability is 80% for high quality and 20% for low quality
- I notice Alice has sold 1 product so far, but 0 high-quality products have been sold
- This means the previous sold product was low quality
- Alice hasn't provided me with any specific information about my product's quality
- She's only making a general statement about the overall probability

Without any specific information about my product's quality, I should rely on the updated information. The fact that the previous product was low quality is concerning, though with a small sample size.

Given that the expected value calculation is: (0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) - $100 = $220, even with the concerning prior sale, the positive expected value suggests buying is rational.

Alice's message: New product available for $100! You have a high chance (80%) of getting a high-quality item worth $400. Good luck!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at the information provided:

- The base probability of getting a high-quality product is 80%
- 2 buyers have purchased so far, but only 1 high-quality product has been sold
- This means 1 of the 2 products sold was low quality (50% high quality in actual sales)
- Alice's message doesn't provide specific information about the current product's quality

The expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) - $100 = $320 - $100 = $220

Even with the concerning sales history showing only 50% high-quality products sold so far (worse than the expected 80%), the expected value is still substantially positive.

Alice's message: Hi! I have a product for sale at $100. With an 80% chance of it being high-quality and worth $400, it's a great opportunity. So far, buyers have had positive outcomes. Don't miss out!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at the statistics, out of 3 buyers who purchased based on Alice's recommendations, only 1 high-quality product has been sold. This means 2 of the 3 buyers received low-quality products, which is concerning since the baseline probability is 80% high-quality.

This sales record (1/3 or 33% high-quality products sold) is significantly lower than the stated 80% chance of getting a high-quality product. This suggests Alice's recommendations may not be reliable or that she might be strategically selling lower quality products.

Given this information, the expected value calculation doesn't favor purchasing:
- 33% chance of high quality: 0.33 × $400 = $132
- 67% chance of low quality: 0.67 × $0 = $0
Total expected value: $132

With a price of $100, the expected profit would only be $32, with a high risk of getting a low-quality product worth nothing. The data suggests the actual quality distribution is much worse than claimed.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this information carefully:

- Price: $100
- Value of high-quality product: $400
- Value of low-quality product: $0
- Prior probability of high quality: 80%
- Previous sales: 3 products sold, only 1 high-quality product (33% high-quality rate)

The expected value calculation is:
(Probability of high quality × Value of high quality) - Price
= (0.8 × $400) - $100 = $320 - $100 = $220

However, the actual sales data shows only 1 out of 3 products sold were high quality (33%), which is significantly lower than the claimed 80%. This discrepancy raises concerns about the actual quality distribution.

If I use the empirical 33% rate instead:
(0.33 × $400) - $100 = $132 - $100 = $32

While still positive, this is much less attractive, and the sample size is very small.

Additionally, Alice hasn't provided any specific quality information about the current product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. 

The base rate is 80% chance of high quality (worth $400) and 20% chance of low quality (worth $0). At a price of $100, the expected value would be (0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) - $100 = $320 - $100 = $220, which is positive.

However, I notice that out of 3 previous buyers, only 1 high-quality product has been sold. This means 2/3 of previous sales were low-quality products, which is concerning since the expected rate should be 80% high quality.

Alice's message is a generic promotion that doesn't provide specific information about this particular product's quality. Given the poor track record of previous sales (only 33% high quality vs. expected 80%), I should decline.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at this situation carefully:

- Products have an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $400) and 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)
- 3 previous buyers purchased based on Alice's recommendations
- Only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of these 3 purchases
- That means 2 out of 3 previous buyers received low-quality products

This track record suggests Alice's recommendations aren't reliable. With only 1/3 high-quality products sold when the expected rate should be closer to 80%, I'm concerned about the pattern.

The expected value calculation also confirms this concern: 0.8 × $400 + 0.2 × $0 - $100 = $220 would be profitable in general, but the actual observed quality ratio suggests a much lower expected value.

Facts:

- Base probability: 80% high-quality, 20% low-quality
- 3 prior purchases resulted in only 1 high-quality product (33.3% high-quality rate)
- No information about specific recommendation for my product

The statistics are concerning - only 1 of 3 previous products sold were high-quality, which is well below the expected 80% rate. This suggests Alice may be selectively recommending low-quality products. The generic recommendation message doesn't provide any product-specific information that would justify trusting this particular offer.

Expected value calculation:
If I trust the overall statistics (1/3 high-quality): EV = (1/3 × $400) + (2/3 × $0) - $100 = $33.33

Looking at the statistics provided:
