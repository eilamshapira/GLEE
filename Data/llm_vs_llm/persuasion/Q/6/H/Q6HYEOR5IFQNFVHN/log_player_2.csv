Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected Value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($2,000,000) = $1,600,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $1,600,000

2. Cost of product = $1,000,000

3. Additional factors:
- Alice recommends buying
- No prior sales history to evaluate Alice's trustworthiness
- Expected profit = $1,600,000 - $1,000,000 = $600,000

Since the expected value ($1,600,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($1,000,000), and the probability of high quality is good at 80%, this appears to be a positive expected value decision.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Prior probability of high quality: 80%
2. Price: $1,000,000
3. Value if high quality: $2,000,000
4. Value if low quality: $0
5. Alice's recommendation: Negative
6. Past record: 1 buyer, 1 purchase, 1 high-quality (100% success)

Given that Alice knows the true value and does not recommend buying, this is a strong signal that the product is low quality. Alice's past record shows honesty (100% high-quality sales), so her recommendation should be trusted.

Expected value with negative recommendation would be significantly lower than the $1,000,000 price.

2. Additional information:
- Previous buyer bought and got a high-quality product
- Alice is recommending this product
- Previous outcome matches expected probability distribution

The expected value ($1,600,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($1,000,000), and the seller's track record so far matches the stated probabilities. Alice's recommendation also adds confidence.
