Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 
   - 50% chance of $300 (high quality)
   - 50% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $300) + (0.5 × $0) = $150
4. Alice recommends buying
5. No previous sales history to reference

Since:
- The expected value ($150) is higher than the price ($100)
- Alice knows the true quality and recommends buying
- Even though there's no track record, there's no indication of dishonesty

The rational choice would be to buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price of product: $100
2. Value to me: $300 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
3. Previous statistics:
   - 1 buyer so far
   - 1 purchase made
   - 1 high-quality product sold
4. Alice recommends buying

The fact that the previous sale was a high-quality product and Alice is recommending this product is positive. Since Alice knows the true quality and has shown honesty in the previous recommendation (as evidenced by the high-quality sale), her recommendation carries weight.

Given that:
- Expected value with 50-50 odds: (300 × 0.5) + (0 × 0.5) = $150
- Price is $100
- Previous track record is positive
- Alice's recommendation is positive

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Previous statistics:
- 2 buyers made purchases
- 1 high-quality product was sold
- This means 1 low-quality product was also sold
- 50% of sold products were high quality, matching the base probability

2. Current situation:
- Alice is recommending to buy
- Alice knows the true quality and my valuation
- Product costs $100
- Worth $300 if high quality, $0 if low quality
- Expected value calculation: (0.5 × $300) + (0.5 × $0) = $150

Since:
- The expected value ($150) is greater than the cost ($100)
- Alice's track record shows she's truthful about quality distribution
- Alice is actively recommending the purchase
- Alice knows the true quality

Based on this analysis, it seems rational to buy.

3. Previous sales:
   - 3 buyers purchased
   - Only 1 high-quality product sold
   - This means 2 low-quality products were sold
4. Alice is recommending to buy

This doesn't look good. Of the previous 3 sales:
- Only 33% (1/3) were high quality
- 66% (2/3) were low quality
- Alice's recommendations led to buyers purchasing low-quality products

Even though Alice is recommending to buy, her track record shows she's not trustworthy, as she's previously recommended products that turned out to be low quality. The expected value based on previous sales would be negative.

1. Past performance:
- 3 buyers purchased products
- Only 1 high-quality product was sold
- This means 2 low-quality products were sold
- Success rate so far is only 33.3%

2. Economics:
- Cost: $100
- Potential value: Either $300 (high) or $0 (low)
- Expected value = 50% × $300 + 50% × $0 = $150

3. Credibility:
- Alice's track record shows she's willing to recommend low-quality products
- Her previous recommendations led to 2 out of 3 buyers getting low-quality products
- This suggests her recommendations aren't reliable

Given that Alice's recommendations have proven unreliable (only 33.3% success rate), and she's shown a pattern of recommending low-quality products, I don't trust her recommendation enough to make the purchase.

1. Historical data:
- 3 buyers purchased products

2. Current situation:
- Alice recommends buying
- But her past recommendations led to 66.7% low-quality sales
- Her track record shows she's not necessarily trustworthy
- The expected value calculation:
  * 50% chance of high quality ($300) = $150
  * 50% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
  * Expected value = $150
  * Price = $100

3. Decision factors:
- While the expected value ($150) is higher than the price ($100)
- Alice's past recommendations resulted in mostly low-quality sales
- This suggests she might be trying to maximize sales regardless of quality

Given Alice's poor track record of recommendations and the high proportion of low-quality products sold, I don't trust her recommendation.

3. Decision factors:

1. Price = $100

4. Prior sales: 4 purchases, only 1 high-quality

5. Alice is recommending to buy

Even though Alice is recommending to buy, her track record shows she's been recommending products that turned out to be low quality 75% of the time. This suggests her recommendations aren't reliable.

With these odds, the expected value calculation would be:
- 25% chance of high quality: 0.25 × $200 = $50
- 75% chance of low quality: 0.75 × (-$100) = -$75
- Expected value = -$25
