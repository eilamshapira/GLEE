This pattern will continue as long as Alice does not recommend the product.

Given the pattern so far, it seems that Alice's recommendations have been accurate. Continuing to follow her recommendations could lead to more high-quality products. However, it's important to note that past performance is not indicative of future results, especially in a game of chance.

There is always a risk that the next product could be of low quality, despite Alice's recommendation.

Given the consistent success so far, it makes sense to continue following Alice's recommendations, but be prepared for the possibility of a low-quality product in future rounds."
