**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Odds:** The inherent odds are against you. There's a 66.67% chance the product is worth $0 to you and only a 33.33% chance it's worth $30,000.
* **Seller's Discouragement:**  Alice, who knows the product's quality, is advising against the purchase. This strongly suggests the product is low quality. 
* **No Positive History:** With no prior sales data, there's no indication that Alice is more likely to offer high-quality products.

**Conclusion:** The risk significantly outweighs the potential reward. It's safer to pass."

Here's why:

* **Unfavorable Odds:** The inherent probability of the product being high quality is only 33.33%. This means you're twice as likely to end up with a worthless product.
* **Negative Signal:** Alice's recommendation against buying the product is a strong negative signal. While she doesn't know your valuations, she likely has some insight into the general quality of products she sells. 
* **No Established History:** Since there's no prior sales data, you have no way to gauge whether Alice might be overstocked with low-quality products.

Given these factors, the risk of buying the product outweighs the potential reward."

**Reasoning:**

* **Prior Probability:**  There's a higher chance (66.67%) that the product is low quality, making it inherently risky.
* **Seller's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation not to buy is a strong signal. While she doesn't know your valuations, she likely sees something about the product's quality that makes it undesirable from a general buyer's perspective.
* **No Previous Sales Data:** The lack of historical data means we can't gauge if Alice is generally trustworthy in her assessments or if she tends to offer better-quality products than the average odds would suggest. 

**Conclusion:** The risk of the product being low quality (and therefore worth $0) outweighs the potential reward, especially with the seller's negative recommendation."

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Odds:** The inherent probability of the product being high quality is only 33.33%, meaning there's a 66.67% chance it's worth nothing to me.
* **Seller's Discouragement:** Alice's recommendation not to buy the product is a strong indicator of its low quality. While she doesn't know my valuations, she likely bases her recommendation on some assessment of the product's general desirability. 
* **No Positive Signals:**  With no prior sales history, there's no information to suggest this product might be an exception to the unfavorable odds. 

**Conclusion:** The risk outweighs the potential reward in this scenario. It's more likely I'd waste $10,000 on a worthless product."
