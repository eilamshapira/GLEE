"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. When Alice doesn't recommend a product, it suggests she's likely being truthful about a low-quality product
2. Low-quality products are worth $0 to me, but cost $1,000,000
3. The expected value calculation isn't favorable if this is likely a low-quality product
4. Alice has no incentive to discourage me from buying a high-quality product since that would hurt her profits

Given this analysis, I should trust Alice's negative recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's previous recommendation was honest - she didn't recommend a low-quality product. This builds trust in her recommendations.

The same logic from the previous round applies:
1. Alice likely has no reason to discourage me from buying a high-quality product
2. Her negative recommendation suggests this is probably another low-quality product
3. Buying a low-quality product would mean losing $1,000,000

I'll continue to trust her negative recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is interesting - now Alice is giving a positive recommendation. Let's analyze:

1. Alice has proven honest in her previous negative recommendations
2. She has a financial incentive to be honest about high-quality products since she wants to sell them
3. If it's high-quality (worth $3M) and costs $1M, I'd make a $2M profit
4. She's built credibility by being truthful about low-quality products
5. Even if there's only a 33.33% chance of high quality overall, her recommendation suggests this one is actually high quality

Given her track record of honesty and the potential profit, I should trust her positive recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to prove trustworthy:

2. Her last positive recommendation correctly identified a high-quality product
3. She's demonstrating a pattern of honest signaling
4. She makes money on sales but seems to care about maintaining credibility
5. Last high-quality purchase gave me a $2M profit
6. There's no apparent reason for her to change strategy now

Given her perfect track record so far and this positive recommendation, I should buy.

3. She seems to be using an honest signaling strategy
4. She has no incentive to discourage purchase of a high-quality product
