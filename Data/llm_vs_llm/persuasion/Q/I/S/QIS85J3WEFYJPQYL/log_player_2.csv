Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected value calculation:
* 80% chance of high quality ($2,000,000) = $1,600,000
* 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
* Total expected value = $1,600,000

2. Cost of product = $1,000,000

3. Additional factors:
* Alice knows the true quality
* Alice recommends buying
* No previous sales history to reference
* Expected profit = $1,600,000 - $1,000,000 = $600,000

Since the expected value ($1,600,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($1,000,000), and Alice recommends buying, it's rational to purchase.

- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $1,600,000

2. Cost of product = $1,000,000

3. Additional information:
- Alice's previous sale was a high-quality product
- Alice is recommending this product
- The previous success suggests Alice is being truthful

The expected value ($1,600,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($1,000,000), and Alice's track record shows honesty. With Alice's recommendation and the positive history, this appears to be a good investment.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Prior probability of high quality: 80%
2. Alice's track record:
   - 2 buyers so far
   - 2 high-quality products sold (100% success rate)
   - Alice is providing a positive recommendation

Given that:
- The expected value calculation: (80% × $2,000,000) + (20% × $0) = $1,600,000
- The price is $1,000,000
- Alice's perfect track record and positive recommendation increase confidence
- The expected value ($1,600,000) exceeds the price ($1,000,000)

This appears to be a positive expected value purchase.

1. Expected value without additional information:
   * 80% chance of high quality ($2,000,000) = $1,600,000
   * 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
   * Total expected value = $1,600,000
   * Price = $1,000,000
   * Basic expected profit = $600,000

2. Additional information from sales history:
   * 3 buyers purchased
   * 2 high-quality products sold (66.67% success rate)
   * Alice recommends buying

3. Reasoning:
   * The prior sales show a slightly lower success rate than the 80% base rate
   * However, Alice knows the true quality and is recommending to buy
   * The expected value still exceeds the price significantly
   * Even with the slightly lower historical performance, the deal remains profitable

Given that Alice knows the true quality and is recommending to buy, combined with the generally favorable expected value, I will buy.

3. Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
4. Sales history: 4 buyers, 3 high-quality products sold (75% success rate)
5. Alice's recommendation: Positive

The seller's track record shows 75% high-quality products sold, which is close to the base probability of 80%. Given Alice's positive recommendation and the overall favorable probabilities, the expected value calculation is:

Expected Value = (0.8 × $2,000,000) - $1,000,000 = $600,000

The positive expected value and Alice's recommendation make this a reasonable investment.

Given that:

- The expected value is: (80% × $2,000,000) = $1,600,000

- Value if low quality: $0

2. Previous sales data:

- 4 high-quality products sold (57% high quality)
- The actual sales history shows a lower proportion of high-quality products than the base probability

3. Expected value calculation:
- If I trust the base 80% probability:
  * EV = (0.8 × $2,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) - $1,000,000
  * EV = $1,600,000 - $1,000,000 = $600,000

4. However, the sales history suggests worse odds than the base probability, and Alice might have an incentive to oversell.

Given that the expected value is significantly positive even with somewhat worse odds than the base probability, I will take the risk.

5. Alice's track record:

Expected value calculation:
* If I rely on Alice's recommendation and the prior probability:
* Expected value = (0.8 × $2,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $1,600,000
* Cost = $1,000,000
* Net expected value = $1,600,000 - $1,000,000 = $600,000

While Alice's past track record shows a lower rate of high-quality products than the prior probability (62.5% vs 80%), the expected value is still significantly higher than the cost, making this a positive expected value decision.

3. Sales history:

4. Alice's recommendation:
   - Alice knows the true value
   - Alice does not recommend buying
   - Given she knows the true value, this is a strong negative signal

Given that Alice doesn't recommend buying and the historical success rate is well below the expected 80%, this suggests the product is likely low quality. If it's low quality, I would lose my entire investment.

The historical data shows that the actual rate of high-quality products sold (55.6%) is significantly lower than the stated 80% probability, which is concerning. This suggests either bad luck or potential bias in the recommendations.
