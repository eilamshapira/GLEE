Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 
   - 80% chance of $200 (high quality)
   - 20% chance of $0 (low quality)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (0.8 × $200) + (0.2 × $0) = $160

The expected value ($160) is higher than the price ($100), making this a positive expected value decision. Even though there's no prior sales history to validate Alice's recommendation, the base probability of 80% high quality makes this a mathematically sound purchase.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1) Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($200 value)
- 20% chance of low quality ($0 value)
- Expected value = (0.8 × $200) + (0.2 × $0) = $160

2) Price is $100, so theoretically there's positive expected value.

3) However, looking at the statistics:
- Only 1 previous buyer
- 0 high-quality products sold
- This suggests the previous sale might have been a low-quality product

4) Despite the concerning statistics, the sample size is very small (just 1 sale), so it's not necessarily indicative of a pattern.

5) Given the base probability of 80% for high quality and Alice's recommendation, the expected value still exceeds the price.

1. Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($200 value) = $160
- 20% chance of low quality ($0 value) = $0
- Total expected value = $160
- Price = $100
- Expected profit = $60

2. Past sales data:
- 2 buyers purchased
- 1 high-quality product confirmed
- This suggests one low-quality product was also sold

3. Alice's recommendation:
- Alice is recommending to buy
- However, given past sales, her recommendation alone may not be fully reliable

4. Decision logic:
- Despite some concerning past sales data, the high base rate of good products (80%) and positive expected value ($60) make this a worthwhile risk

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Known statistics:
- 3 buyers purchased so far
- Only 1 high-quality product among those sold
- This means 2 were low-quality products
- Base probability is 80% high quality, 20% low quality

2. Concerns:
- The ratio of high to low quality products sold (1:2) is worse than the expected 80:20 ratio
- Alice's recommendations so far have led to more low-quality sales than high-quality

3. Decision factors:
- Expected value calculation:
  * 80% chance of $200 value = $160
  * 20% chance of $0 value = $0
  * Total expected value = $160
  * Price = $100
  * Theoretical profit = $60

However, given that previous sales have shown poor quality outcomes despite Alice's recommendations, I should decline this offer.

1. Historical data:
- 3 buyers purchased products

- Current success rate is only 33.3% (1/3)

2. Base probabilities:

- 20% chance of low quality

3. Risk assessment:
- Price: $100
- Potential value: $200 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Historical performance is significantly worse than the base probability
- Alice's recommendation track record isn't good given previous results

Given that only 1 out of 3 previous products were high quality (33.3%), which is much worse than the stated 80% probability, and considering Alice's previous recommendations led to mostly low-quality purchases, I don't trust the recommendation enough to risk $100.

5. Alice's recommendation seems unreliable given the poor track record
