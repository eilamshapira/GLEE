"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Given the probabilities and payoffs, it makes sense to buy the product each round as long as Alice recommends it. The expected value of buying the product is:

\( \text{Expected Value} = (0.80 \times \$40,000) + (0.20 \times \$0) - \$10,000 = \$22,000 \)

Since the expected value is positive, it is rational to buy the product whenever Alice recommends it."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

As calculated earlier, the expected value of buying the product is $22,000, so it is beneficial to buy the product whenever Alice recommends it."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Since the expected value remains positive ($22,000), it is still beneficial to buy the product based on Alice's recommendation.

Additionally, over twenty rounds, all possible outcomes of the binomial distribution reveal that on average, four products will be low-quality, and sixteen will be high-quality.

The expected profit over 20 rounds is:

\( \text{Expected Profit} = 16 \times (\$40,000 - \$10,000) + 4 \times (\$0 - \$10,000) = \$440,000 \)

The expected profit over the next 15 rounds is:

\( \text{Expected Profit} = 12 \times (\$40,000 - \$10,000) + 3 \times (\$0 - \$10,000) =  \$330,000 \)

This supports the decision to continue buying the products Alice recommends."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Despite the previous product being of low quality, the expected value remains positive, so it is still beneficial to buy the product when recommended by Alice."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Even though the last two products were of low quality, the expected value still favors buying the product. The probabilities have not changed, and the long-term expectation remains positive."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

The results are consistent with the expected distribution. Given 9 rounds, expecting two low-quality items and seven high-quality items is reasonable.

The expected profit over the last 11 rounds is:

\( \text{Expected Profit} = 8.8 \times (\$40,000 - \$10,000) + 2.2 \times (\$0 - \$10,000) =  \$234,000 \)

You should continue to buy the products Alice recommends."
