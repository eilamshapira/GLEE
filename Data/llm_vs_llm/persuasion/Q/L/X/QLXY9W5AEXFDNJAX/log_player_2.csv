"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this strategically.

The expected value calculation:
- 33.33% chance of high quality ($120) = $40
- 66.67% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
Total expected value = $40

Since the price is $100, and the expected value is only $40, it's not rational to buy based purely on the odds, even with Alice's recommendation.

Without more information about Alice's incentives or the reliability of her recommendations, I should be conservative.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $120 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Interesting - in Round 1, Alice recommended a high-quality product. This suggests her recommendations might have some value, though one data point isn't enough to be certain.

In this round, Alice is specifically recommending NOT to buy. Given that:
1. The base expected value is still $40 (33.33% * $120)
2. Alice has shown one truthful recommendation so far
3. She's now actively recommending against this purchase
4. The price ($100) is still well above the expected value

Following her recommendation seems prudent, especially since it aligns with the basic economic calculation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendations have been accurate in both previous rounds:
- Round 1: Recommended to buy → Was high quality
- Round 2: Recommended not to buy → Was low quality

This suggests Alice is being truthful in her recommendations and is helping me avoid bad purchases. Her track record so far is 2/2 accurate recommendations.

Given that:
1. She's again recommending not to buy
2. Her previous recommendations have been reliable
3. The base economics still don't favor buying ($100 cost vs $40 expected value without additional information)
4. She seems to be helping identify which products are worth buying

I'll continue to trust her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

- Round 3: Recommended don't buy → Low quality (accurate)

She's now 3/3 in accurate recommendations, showing a consistent pattern of:
1. Recommending to buy when it's high quality
2. Recommending not to buy when it's low quality

Given that:
1. She's again recommending not to buy
2. She has a perfect track record so far
3. She appears to be honest in helping identify good products
4. The baseline economics still don't favor blind buying

I'll continue to trust her recommendation.

- Round 3: Recommended don't buy → Low quality (accurate)
- Round 4: Recommended don't buy → Low quality (accurate)

She's now 4/4 in accurate recommendations. This is building a very strong pattern that:
1. She's being completely honest
2. She has accurate information about product quality
3. She's actively helping me avoid low-quality products

With another ""do not buy"" recommendation and her perfect track record, the rational choice is to continue trusting her judgment.
