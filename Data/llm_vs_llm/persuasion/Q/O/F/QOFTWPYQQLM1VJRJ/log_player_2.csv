"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this rationally:

1. The base probability is 33.33% for high quality ($4M value) and 66.67% for low quality ($0 value)
2. Alice has chosen not to recommend this product
3. If Alice is being truthful, this might indicate the product is more likely to be low quality
4. Expected value calculation without recommendation:
   - (0.3333 × $4M) + (0.6667 × $0) - $1M = $333,200 (positive EV)
5. With Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of high quality is likely even lower
6. This would make the expected value negative

Since Alice's negative recommendation likely pushes the expected value below zero, it's rational to decline.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's previous recommendation was accurate - she advised against buying a low-quality product. This suggests she might be providing honest recommendations.

Following the same logic as before:

1. Base probability remains 33.33% for high quality and 66.67% for low quality
2. Alice is again not recommending the product
3. Her previous negative recommendation proved truthful
4. Given her demonstrated honesty in Round 1, her negative recommendation here likely indicates another low-quality product
5. The expected value is likely negative when accounting for her recommendation

It's rational to continue trusting Alice's negative recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Now this is interesting. Let's analyze:

1. Alice has proven honest in her previous two recommendations - both times she didn't recommend, the products were indeed low quality
2. Now she's giving her first positive recommendation
3. Given her demonstrated honesty so far, this positive recommendation likely indicates a high-quality product
4. If it is high quality:
   - I pay $1M
   - I get $4M value
   - Net profit = $3M
5. Her previous accurate recommendations increase the credibility of this positive recommendation
6. The expected value is likely positive, possibly approaching the high-quality scenario

Given Alice's established track record of honest recommendations and this being her first positive recommendation, it's rational to trust her.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 4

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's track record is now even stronger:

1. She has been honest in all three previous recommendations:
   - Two negative recommendations → both were low quality
   - One positive recommendation → it was high quality
2. She's now giving another negative recommendation
3. Given her perfect track record of honesty, this strongly suggests another low-quality product
4. If it's low quality:
   - I pay $1M
   - I get $0 value
   - Net loss = -$1M
5. Alice appears to be a reliable signal of product quality

Given Alice's consistent honesty and her negative recommendation, it's rational to decline.

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

   - One positive recommendation → it was high quality
2. She's giving another negative recommendation
3. Her consistent honesty suggests she's acting as a truthful signal about product quality
4. When she doesn't recommend, so far it has always been low quality
5. If it's low quality:

   - Net loss = -$1M

Given Alice's continued perfect track record and her negative recommendation, it's rational to decline.
