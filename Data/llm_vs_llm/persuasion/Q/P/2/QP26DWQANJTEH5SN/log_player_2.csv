Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50%): $12,500
   - Low quality (50%): $0
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $12,500) + (0.5 × $0) = $6,250

Even with Alice's recommendation, since there's no track record yet to establish her credibility, I need to rely on the basic probability. The expected value ($6,250) is less than the price ($10,000), making this a risky purchase with negative expected returns.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50%): $12,500 (profit of $2,500)
   - Low quality (50%): $0 (loss of $10,000)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (50% × $12,500) + (50% × $0) = $6,250

4. Alice recommends buying, but:
   - No track record to verify trustworthiness
   - Her incentive is to sell regardless of quality
   - Expected value ($6,250) < Price ($10,000)

Given that the expected value is less than the price, and there's no historical data to trust Alice's recommendation, it would be economically unwise to buy.

Given that the expected value is lower than the price, and there's no track record to establish trust in Alice's recommendations, it would be rational to decline.
