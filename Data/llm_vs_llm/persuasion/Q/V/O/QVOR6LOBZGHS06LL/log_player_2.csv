Instead, you bought one low-quality product early on. I'm starting to think that you might be looking for something specific in a low-quality product. If that's the case, this one might be worth considering for $10000.

I'm going to take a guess that you're not interested in buying another low-quality product at this point. Am I right? The price is still $10000, but I'm not expecting you to buy this one.

Considering you've only bought one product in 14 rounds, and it was a low-quality one, I'm starting to think that you might be waiting for the perfect opportunity to buy a high-quality product.

However, this low-quality product might not be the best fit for that. Unless you're looking to add another low-quality product to your collection for a specific reason, I think you might want to pass on this one. The price of $10000 is still a bit steep for a low-quality product, and I think you can do better.

The price of $10000 is still a bit steep for a low-quality product, and I think you can do better. Let's focus on finding another high-quality product to add to your collection in the final round.

I think you've made some great purchasing decisions so far, and I don't want to see you end on a low note. Let's part ways on a high note, and I wish you all the best with your collection.
