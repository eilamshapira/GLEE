Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this decision:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (80% chance): $12,500
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value = (0.8 × $12,500) + (0.2 × $0) = $10,000

The expected value equals the price, and Alice recommends buying the product. While there's no track record to base additional trust on, the base probability of 80% high quality makes this a reasonable risk to take.

1. Price: $10,000
2. Expected value calculation:
   * 80% chance of high quality ($12,500) = $10,000
   * 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
   * Total expected value = $10,000

3. Previous sales data:
   * 1 buyer before me
   * 1 high-quality product sold
   * 100% success rate so far

4. Alice recommends buying

The expected value equals the price, and considering:
- Alice's perfect track record so far
- Her positive recommendation
- The high base probability of getting a high-quality product (80%)

- Alice is recommending this product

3. Decision factors:
- Expected value equals the asking price ($10,000)

- Alice recommends buying

3. Decision factors:
- The expected value equals the price

1. Price: $10,000
2. Value if high quality: $12,500 (profit of $2,500)

4. Prior sales:
   - 4 buyers total
   - 3 high-quality products sold
   - This shows a 75% success rate

With an 80% base probability of high quality and Alice's positive recommendation, plus the track record showing 75% high-quality sales (which is close to the expected 80%), this seems like a reasonable risk.

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of $12,500 = $10,000
- 20% chance of $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $10,000
- Cost = $10,000

- 80% chance of high quality ($12,500) = $10,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0

2) Alice's track record:
- 7 previous buyers
- 5 high-quality products sold
