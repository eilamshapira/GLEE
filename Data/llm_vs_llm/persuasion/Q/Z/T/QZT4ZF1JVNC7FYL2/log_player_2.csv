Alice's message: Trust the odds! With an 80% chance of high-quality, this product is a great bet. Don't miss out on a potential gem!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($30,000) = $24,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $24,000

2. Cost = $10,000

3. Net expected value = $24,000 - $10,000 = $14,000

Since the net expected value is positive and significantly higher than the cost, this is a good investment opportunity. The 80% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $30,000 makes this a rational decision even with the risk.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product odds:
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $30,000)
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)
- Price is $10,000

2. Previous sales data:
- 1 buyer so far
- 1 high-quality product sold
- 100% success rate

3. Expected value calculation:
- High quality (80%): $30,000 × 0.8 = $24,000
- Low quality (20%): $0 × 0.2 = $0
- Total expected value: $24,000
- Minus price ($10,000)
- Net expected value: $14,000

Since the expected value ($24,000) is significantly higher than the price ($10,000), and the previous sale was successful, this appears to be a good investment opportunity.
