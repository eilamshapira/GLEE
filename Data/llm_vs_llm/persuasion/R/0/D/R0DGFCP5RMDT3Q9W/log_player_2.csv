Given the information that Alice is not recommending the product, and knowing the statistics of the product quality, it is strategically better to pass on the product. The expected value of a product is:

\( E = 0.8 \times \$12,500 + 0.2 \times \$0 = \$10,000 \)

Since Alice is not recommending the product, it might indicate that the product is more likely to be of low quality. Therefore, it is reasonable to decide not to buy the product."

Given that Alice recommends the product and knowing the probability of getting a high-quality product is 80%, it is a good strategy to buy the product. The expected value of a product is:

\( E = 0.8 \times \$12,500 + 0.2 \times \$0 = \$10,000 \)

Since the expected value equals the buying price and Alice recommends it, it makes sense to buy the product."
