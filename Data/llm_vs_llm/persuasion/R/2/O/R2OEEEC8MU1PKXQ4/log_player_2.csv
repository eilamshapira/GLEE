Alice's message: This is a truly exceptional product. I'm confident you'll be incredibly satisfied with its quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   * High quality (33.33% chance): $4,000,000
   * Low quality (66.67% chance): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (0.3333 × $4,000,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $1,333,200

Since there's no previous sales history to go by, I can only rely on the base probabilities and Alice's recommendation. Even though Alice is making a strong positive recommendation, she has an incentive to sell regardless of quality.

The expected value ($1,333,200) is higher than the price ($1,000,000), making this a mathematically positive expected value decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Previous statistics:
- 1 buyer before me
- 1 sale made
- 1 high-quality product sold
- 100% of sold products were high quality

2. Economics:
- Cost: $1,000,000
- Value if high quality: $4,000,000 (33.33% chance)
- Value if low quality: $0 (66.67% chance)
- Expected value without additional information: $1,333,333

3. Additional factors:
- Alice's previous recommendation led to a successful high-quality sale
- Alice is giving a positive recommendation for this product
- Alice knows the true value of the product
- Alice's past behavior shows honesty in recommendations

Given that Alice has demonstrated truthful behavior (1/1 successful high-quality sales) and is strongly recommending this product, combined with the potential for significant profit ($3,000,000 if high quality), I will trust the recommendation.

- Cost is $1,000,000
- Potential value is $4,000,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Expected value = (0.3333 × $4,000,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $1,333,200

3. Alice's message:
- The message is positive but vague
- Given the mixed track record (50% high quality sold), the ambiguous recommendation doesn't inspire confidence

4. Decision rationale:
- While the expected value ($1,333,200) is technically higher than the cost ($1,000,000), the track record and vague recommendation suggest caution
- The risk of losing the entire investment is too high given the uncertain signals

- Expected value ($1,333,200) is higher than the cost ($1,000,000)

- Potential gain: $4,000,000 (if high quality)

- Alice's track record doesn't show she's reliably steering buyers toward high-quality products

4. Alice's message:

   - 3 buyers purchased
   - Only 1 high-quality product sold
   - This means 2 low-quality products were sold

The fact that 2 out of 3 previous buyers got low-quality products despite Alice's recommendations suggests that Alice's recommendations might not be reliable. This ratio (1/3 high quality) actually matches the base probability of getting a high-quality product (33.33%).

Given that:
- The expected value is: (0.3333 × $4,000,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $1,333,320
