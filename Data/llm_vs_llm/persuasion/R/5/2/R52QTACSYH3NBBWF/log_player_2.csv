Alice's message: I have a limited opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. While all sales are final, I assure you this product aligns with the high standards I strive to uphold. Given the significant potential value, I recommend a serious consideration of this offer. This is a worthwhile opportunity to enhance your portfolio.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Prior probability:
- 80% chance of high quality ($20,000 value)
- 20% chance of low quality ($0 value)

2. Expected value:
(0.8 × $20,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $16,000

3. Cost:
- Fixed price of $10,000

4. Net expected value:
$16,000 - $10,000 = $6,000 (positive)

Since the expected value ($16,000) is higher than the cost ($10,000), and there's a significant positive net expected value ($6,000), it's rational to make the purchase.

3. Previous statistics:
