Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the statistics provided, Alice has recommended 2 products so far, including the current one. One product was sold, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, indicating the first sold product was of low quality. 

Now, Alice is recommending you to buy this product. Given the recommendation and considering the chance of acquiring a high-quality product (33.33%), along with the fact no high-quality products have been sold yet, the decision could be weighted towards buying if trusting Alice's recommendation, as there still remains potential for a high-quality offer.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make an informed decision, let's first analyze the given statistics:

1. Total buyers so far: 3
2. Products sold: 3
3. High-quality products sold: 2

The probability of a product being high quality, given that it was sold, can be estimated from Alice's previous sales:

- Proportion of high-quality products sold = High-quality / Total sold = 2/3 ≈ 66.67%

Alice recommended buying the product, and based on previous sales records, it seems she has a good track record of selling high-quality products. Given the improved likelihood from the general probability (66.67% vs. 33.33% prior), Alice's recommendation strongly hints toward a higher quality probability than random chance.

With this information, it seems reasonable to trust the recommendation.

"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 4 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 5th buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make a decision, we need to assess the likelihood of the current product being high quality given Alice's recommendation and sales statistics. Here's the breakdown:

- 4 products have been sold.
- Of these, 2 were high-quality, meaning the current track record for high-quality is 50% among sold products.
- Alice recommends this product, which indicates she might know it's high-quality, especially since this will influence the statistics favorably if true.

Given Alice's track record with the current statistics and her recommendation, there's a reasonable chance of the product being high-quality.

"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 5 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 3 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 6th buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make an informed decision, let's analyze the information provided:

1. Alice's Recommendation: She recommends buying the product. Given that Alice knows the quality of each product, this suggests the current product might be high quality.

2. Sales Statistics:
   - 5 purchases were made.
   - 3 high-quality products were sold.
   - Probability of high-quality product for sales so far = 3/5 = 60%.

Given these considerations, there's a strong indication that recommended products are likely to be of high quality and that Alice tends to recommend high-quality products. Therefore, it might be reasonable to make the purchase.

"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 6 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 4 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 7th buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make an informed decision, let's first analyze the statistics and the recommendation:

1. Total buyers so far, including you: 7
2. Products sold: 6
3. High-quality products sold: 4
4. Proportion of sold products that were high quality: 4/6 ≈ 0.67

Based on Alice's recommendations, 67% of the time the products sold have been high quality. Alice is recommending the current product to you as well. Considering these details, it's a good indication that this product might also be high quality.

Given the expected value for each scenario:
- High-quality: Worth $1,250,000 to you.
- Low-quality: Worth $0 to you.

Considering Alice's recommendation and the past success rate, there is a good probability that the product is high quality. Therefore, it makes sense to follow the recommendation.
