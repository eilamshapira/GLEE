Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The product costs $10,000
2. If high quality, I gain $40,000 (profit of $30,000)
3. If low quality, I gain $0 (loss of $10,000)
4. Alice does not recommend buying
5. No prior sales history to reference

Given that Alice has no incentive to lie (as her past recommendations would be verifiable in the sales record), her negative recommendation likely indicates this is a low-quality product. If I trust her recommendation, I would likely lose my $10,000 investment.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 50% chance of $40,000 (high quality)
   - 50% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $40,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $20,000
4. Alice doesn't recommend buying
5. No previous sales data to reference

Alice's negative recommendation suggests she might know the product is low quality. Since she has no incentive to lie (her price is fixed), her recommendation is likely honest. This significantly increases the probability that this is a low-quality product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50% chance): $40,000
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (50% × $40,000) + (50% × $0) = $20,000

4. Alice has recommended buying the product, which might indicate it's high quality
5. There's no historical data to validate Alice's trustworthiness

Since the expected value ($20,000) is higher than the price ($10,000), and we have a positive recommendation from Alice, it's rational to buy.

1. Price of product: $10,000
2. Potential value:

   - Low quality: $0 (50% chance)
3. Previous statistics:
   - 1 buyer before me
   - 1 high-quality product sold
4. Alice is recommending to buy

The previous sale resulted in a high-quality product, and Alice is now recommending this product. This suggests Alice might be honest in her recommendations. 

Expected value calculation:
- If it's high quality (50%): $40,000 - $10,000 = $30,000 profit
- If it's low quality (50%): $0 - $10,000 = -$10,000 loss
- Expected value: (50% × $30,000) + (50% × -$10,000) = $10,000

Since the expected value is positive ($10,000), and Alice has shown honesty in her previous recommendation, it's rational to buy.

3. Historical data:
   - 2 buyers so far
   - 2 sales
   - Both were high quality (100% high quality rate)
4. Alice is recommending to buy

This looks favorable because:
- Alice has a perfect track record so far (2/2 high quality)
- She's recommending this product
- The expected value is positive:
  - If high quality: $40,000 - $10,000 = $30,000 profit

   - 100% success rate so far
5. Alice does NOT recommend buying this product

Despite Alice's good track record (100% high-quality products sold), the fact that she specifically does NOT recommend this product is a strong signal. Given that Alice has been honest with previous buyers (as evidenced by the perfect track record), her negative recommendation likely means this is a low-quality product.
