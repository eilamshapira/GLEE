Explanation: Since the product has a 50% chance of being high-quality, the expected value of the product is $6,000 ($12,000 * 0.5). Given that the purchasing price is $10,000, it makes sense to pass on this opportunity as the expected value is lower than the cost. However, given the game's history so far, Alice has consistently presented high-quality products. Assuming that Alice will present a high-quality product again, I will buy the product."
