Round 8
Alice's message: While this product has been properly processed, I don't have any additional information to share about its quality at this time.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is a noticeable change in Alice's messaging. She's no longer confidently asserting this product meets high quality standards, which is a potential signal. However, even without her explicit recommendation, the baseline probability is 80% high quality, which gives an expected value of: 0.8×$300 + 0.2×$0 = $240. Since the price is $100, the expected profit is still $140, which makes buying worthwhile despite the less enthusiastic recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice's message: I'm pleased to say that this product has cleared our rigorous quality checks, and I'm confident it will meet the high standards you've come to expect from me.

Would you like to buy the current product?","After experiencing a low-quality product in the previous round when Alice's messaging changed, she's now returned to her confident recommendation style. This suggests she may be providing genuine signals about product quality. Given her previous accuracy with positive recommendations and the underlying 80% probability of high quality, I'll trust this recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $300 for you.

Round 10
Alice's message: This product has been prepared according to standard procedures, but I don't have any specific details to share regarding its quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is the second time Alice has used this more neutral language without strongly recommending the product. The previous time she used similar language in Round 8, the product turned out to be low quality. This pattern suggests Alice may be honestly signaling when a product is of lower quality.

However, I still need to consider the baseline probabilities. With an 80% chance of high quality, the expected value is 0.8×$300 + 0.2×$0 = $240, which exceeds the $100 price. Despite the concerning language, the expected profit is still $140.

Given Alice's apparent pattern of signaling, though, I'll decline this purchase.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 11

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has returned to her enthusiastic recommendation style, similar to rounds where products were high quality. She seems to be reliably signaling quality: she uses positive language for high-quality products and neutral language for low-quality ones. This pattern has been consistent across all rounds so far. 

Given her positive recommendation here and the pattern she's established, I believe this is a high-quality product.

Round 12

She's specifically mentioning the quality control team's approval and expressing confidence in the product's excellence. Based on the pattern established so far, this signals a high-quality product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"

Round 19
Alice's message: This product has been processed according to standard procedures, but I don't have any additional information to share about its quality at this time, so I recommend exercising caution with your purchasing decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This message follows Alice's established pattern for signaling low-quality products. She's using neutral language about ""standard procedures"" and explicitly states she doesn't have additional quality information. She even adds a caution about my purchasing decision, which is a stronger warning than previous similar messages.

In the past, when Alice has used this type of neutral or cautious language (Rounds 8 and 10), the products turned out to be low quality. Following this pattern, I should decline this purchase.
