Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $30,000
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(33.33% × $30,000) + (66.67% × $0) = $10,000

The expected value equals the price, but there are a few considerations:
- No sales history to validate Alice's credibility
- Alice recommends buying, but their incentive is to sell regardless of quality
- High risk of losing entire investment (66.67% chance)

Given the high risk and lack of historical data to trust Alice's recommendation, it would be safer to decline.

Expected value calculation:

The expected value equals the price, but there are other factors to consider:
- No sales history to verify Alice's credibility
- Alice recommends buying, but she has incentive to sell regardless of quality
- High risk of loss ($10,000) vs potential gain ($20,000)

Given this is a high-risk situation with no historical data to support the decision, and the expected value just breaks even, it would be more prudent to decline.

4. Considerations:
   - The expected value equals the price
   - No previous sales data to verify Alice's credibility
   - Alice's recommendation might be biased since she benefits from selling
   - First mover has no historical data to rely on

While the expected value matches the price, there's significant risk since two-thirds of products are low quality, and I have no historical data to validate Alice's trustworthiness.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Expected value calculation:
- 33.33% chance of high quality ($30,000) = $10,000
- 66.67% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $10,000

2. Cost of product = $10,000

3. Considerations:
- The expected value equals the cost
- No historical data to validate Alice's recommendations
- Alice has incentive to sell regardless of quality
- Alice's recommendation provides little value without track record

While the expected value matches the cost, there's significant risk of loss with no historical data to support the decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Cost: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 33.33% chance of $30,000 (high quality)
   - 66.67% chance of $0 (low quality)

Expected value calculation:
(0.3333 × $30,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $10,000

The expected value equals the cost, but there are a few considerations:
- No prior sales history to validate Alice's reliability
- Alice is recommending the purchase
- High risk due to the possibility of getting $0 value

Since the expected value equals the cost and Alice is recommending it, I'll take the risk.
