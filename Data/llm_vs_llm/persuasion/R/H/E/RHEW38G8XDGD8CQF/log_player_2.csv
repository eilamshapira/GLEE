Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. Price is $1,000,000
2. If high quality: worth $3,000,000 (gain of $2,000,000)
3. If low quality: worth $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
4. Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
5. Alice doesn't recommend buying
6. No previous sales data to reference

Alice's recommendation against buying suggests the product might be low quality. Since she knows the true quality, her recommendation carries weight.

Expected value without considering Alice's recommendation:
(50% × $2,000,000) + (50% × -$1,000,000) = $500,000

However, given Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of low quality is likely higher than 50%, making the expected value negative.

4. Base probability is 50% for each quality
5. Alice doesn't recommend buying
6. No prior sales history to reference

Alice's recommendation against buying suggests the product might be low quality. While she could be strategic in her recommendation, without any sales history to establish her credibility or pattern, and given her negative recommendation, it's safer to decline.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. Price is $1,000,000
2. If high quality: worth $3,000,000 (profit of $2,000,000)

4. Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
5. Alice does NOT recommend buying
6. No previous sales data to reference

Given that Alice doesn't recommend buying, this suggests the product might be low quality. While there's still a chance it could be high quality (Alice could be strategic or deceptive), without any previous sales data to understand Alice's recommendation patterns, it's safer to be cautious.

The expected value calculation under base probability would be:
(50% × $2,000,000) + (50% × -$1,000,000) = $500,000

But with Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of it being low quality is likely higher than 50%, making the expected value negative.

5. Alice doesn't recommend buying
6. As a seller, Alice would generally want to sell, so a negative recommendation likely means it's low quality
7. There's no previous sales data to consider

Given Alice's negative recommendation and no contrary evidence from past sales, it's likely this is a low-quality product. The risk of losing $1,000,000 is too high.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The base expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of high quality ($3M) = $1.5M
- 50% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Expected value = $1.5M
- Cost = $1M
- Basic expected profit = $0.5M

2. Additional considerations:
- Alice knows the true quality
- Alice does not recommend buying
- Alice has no established track record yet
- Alice has no clear incentive to lie or be truthful

The fact that Alice doesn't recommend buying is a significant red flag. Since she knows the true quality, her negative recommendation likely indicates this is a low-quality product. If it were high quality, she would probably want to make the sale and establish a good reputation.

Given Alice's recommendation against buying, the probability of this being a low-quality product is likely much higher than 50%, making the expected value less than the $1M cost.

Given that Alice doesn't recommend buying, this suggests the product might be low quality. While Alice's motives aren't clear (she might be honest or strategic), her negative recommendation combined with having no established track record makes this seem too risky.

The expected value without considering Alice's recommendation would be:
