"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation carefully.

In this game:
- Price of each product: $1,000,000
- High-quality product worth: $1,200,000 (50% chance)
- Low-quality product worth: $0 (50% chance)

Without any additional information, the expected value of a random product is:
(50% × $1,200,000) + (50% × $0) = $600,000

Since the expected value ($600,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), I shouldn't buy a product without additional reliable information.

Alice has recommended I buy the product, but I don't yet know if her recommendations are trustworthy or if she's simply trying to sell products regardless of quality. In this first round, I have no evidence about her recommendation patterns.

The rational choice is to decline.
