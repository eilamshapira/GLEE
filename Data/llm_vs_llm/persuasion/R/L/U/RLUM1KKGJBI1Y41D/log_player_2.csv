Alice's message: Hello! I'm offering a fantastic product today for $10000. Considering the rarity of high-quality items and the potential for significant value, this is a great opportunity. Don't miss out!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $10,000
2. Possible values:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): Worth $20,000
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): Worth $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (33.33% × $20,000) + (66.67% × $0) = $6,666

4. Considerations:
   - The expected value ($6,666) is less than the price ($10,000)
   - No previous sales history to evaluate Alice's honesty
   - Alice's message is generic and doesn't provide specific quality information
   - The odds favor getting a low-quality product

Given that the expected value is lower than the price and there's no track record to establish trust, the rational decision is not to buy.

Alice's message: Good day! I have a rare, high-value product available for $10000. Given that high-quality items are scarce, and this one could be worth a lot to you, I suggest you seriously consider this offer. It's a steal at this price!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $10,000
2. Potential values:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $20,000
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.3333 × $20,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $6,666

Since the expected value ($6,666) is less than the price ($10,000), and there's no track record to establish Alice's credibility, the rational decision would be not to buy.

Alice's message: Hello! Today's offer is a premium product, available for $10000. With the limited availability of top-tier items, this is a chance to acquire something truly special. This won't last! 

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $20,000 profit
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): $10,000 loss

3. Key considerations:
- No sales history to evaluate Alice's honesty
- Alice's message is vague and uses sales pressure tactics
- The expected value calculation:
  (0.3333 × $20,000) + (0.6667 × $0) - $10,000 = -$3,334

Without any track record and given that the expected value is negative, it would be unwise to make this purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $10,000
2. Potential values:
   - High quality (33.33%): $20,000 (profit: $10,000)
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0 (loss: $10,000)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (0.3333 × $20,000) + (0.6667 × $0) - $10,000 = -$3,334

4. Considerations:
   - No prior sales history to evaluate trustworthiness
   - Alice's message is vague and doesn't provide specific quality information
   - Expected value is negative
   - Higher probability of loss than gain

Given the negative expected value and lack of prior sales information to establish trust, the rational decision is not to buy.

Alice's message: Hello! I'm offering a premium product for $10000. High-quality items like this are rare and highly sought after. Take advantage of this chance before it's gone!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this rationally:

- There's no sales history to evaluate Alice's credibility
- Alice's message is promotional but doesn't explicitly state the quality
- Expected value ($6,667) is less than the price ($10,000)
- Risk of losing entire investment is high (66.67% chance)
