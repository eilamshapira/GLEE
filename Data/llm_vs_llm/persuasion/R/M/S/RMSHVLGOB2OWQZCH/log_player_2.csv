Alice's message: We're halfway through our 20 rounds, and so far, only one product has met your standards. I'm not trying to be pessimistic, but the odds are against this one being a high-quality product. If you're looking for a good investment, I'd advise waiting for a better opportunity. But if you'd like to take a chance, it's still $10000.
