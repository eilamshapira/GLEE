Here's the reasoning:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is incentivized to recommend the product to maximize her sales. Even if she knows it's low quality, recommending it increases the chance of a sale. 
* **Historical Data:** The sales record shows a high proportion of high-quality products sold (10/12 = 83.3%). This is significantly higher than the inherent 80% chance of a high-quality product. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($200) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0).

Given the strong historical data and Alice's positive recommendation, the decision to buy is a reasonable one."
