"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. If high quality (80% chance): Worth $1,250,000 (profit of $250,000)
3. If low quality (20% chance): Worth $0 (loss of $1,000,000)

Expected value calculation:
* 80% × $250,000 = $200,000 (potential gain)
* 20% × (-$1,000,000) = -$200,000 (potential loss)

The expected value equals $0, but since Alice has chosen to recommend this product, it might indicate that it's more likely to be high quality. Given Alice's recommendation and the base probability favoring high quality, I'll take the risk.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's previous recommendation was honest and led to a profitable outcome. Since she's continuing to recommend this product as well, and the fundamental probabilities haven't changed, I'll maintain my reasoning:

1. Base probability remains 80% for high quality
2. Previous honest recommendation increases trust in Alice's recommendations
3. Expected value calculation remains the same:
   * 80% × $250,000 = $200,000 (potential gain)
   * 20% × (-$1,000,000) = -$200,000 (potential loss)

Given Alice's track record and the favorable base probability, I'll continue to trust the recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is an interesting change. Alice has been honest in her previous two recommendations which led to profitable outcomes. Now she's explicitly recommending NOT to buy the product. 

Given that:
1. Alice has proven trustworthy so far
2. She knows the true quality and values
3. She's specifically advising against purchase
4. She has no incentive to lie (she gets $1M either way if I buy)

This strongly suggests this product is likely low quality. If it were high quality, she would probably recommend buying it as she did in the previous rounds.

I'll trust her negative recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has proven to be consistently honest in her recommendations so far:
1. First two ""buy"" recommendations -> both high quality
2. One ""don't buy"" recommendation -> was indeed low quality

This builds strong confidence in her recommendations. She appears to be truthfully signaling product quality, which makes sense as she has no incentive to deceive (she gets the same price regardless).

Since she's recommending to buy again, and her previous recommendations have been reliable indicators of quality, I'll continue to trust her judgment.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to demonstrate perfect reliability in her recommendations:
1. All ""buy"" recommendations have led to high-quality products
2. Her ""don't buy"" recommendation helped avoid a low-quality product
3. She appears to be acting as a truthful signaler of product quality

Since:
- She's recommending to buy again
- Her track record is perfect so far
- She has no incentive to suddenly start deceiving
- The base probability of 80% high quality also supports this decision

I will continue to trust her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to maintain a perfect track record:
1. All five ""buy"" recommendations -> all high quality products
2. One ""don't buy"" recommendation -> low quality product
3. She's proving to be a completely reliable indicator of product quality

Given:
- She's recommending to buy again
- Her recommendations have been 100% accurate
- She gets the same price regardless of quality, so no incentive to lie
- Base probability of 80% high quality aligns with trusting her

I will continue following her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has maintained perfect credibility so far:
1. All six ""buy"" recommendations -> all were high quality
2. Her previous ""don't buy"" recommendation -> correctly avoided low quality
3. She has consistently proven to be honest in signaling product quality

Now she's again recommending NOT to buy, and given:
- Her perfect track record of honest recommendations
- Her previous ""don't buy"" warning was accurate
- She has no incentive to lie (gets $1M either way if I buy)
- She knows the true quality

This strongly suggests this is another low-quality product that should be avoided.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to demonstrate perfect reliability:
1. All six ""buy"" recommendations -> all high quality
2. Both ""don't buy"" recommendations -> both low quality
3. She's maintaining her role as a truthful signaler

When she recommends against buying:
- It has always correctly indicated low quality
- She has no reason to lie (same price either way)
- Her perfect track record builds strong trust
- She knows the true quality

Given another ""don't buy"" recommendation, I'll continue to trust her judgment.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

3. She has been 100% reliable in indicating product quality

For this new recommendation to buy:
