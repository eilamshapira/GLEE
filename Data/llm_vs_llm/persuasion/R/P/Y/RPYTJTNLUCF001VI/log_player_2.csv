Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (80% chance): $1,200,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $1,200,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $960,000

Since the expected value ($960,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), even with Alice's recommendation, it's not a profitable decision to buy.

2. Cost of product: $1,000,000

3. Considerations:
* The expected value ($960,000) is less than the cost ($1,000,000)
* There's no prior sales history to validate Alice's trustworthiness
* While Alice recommends buying, she has incentive to sell regardless of quality
* The potential loss ($1,000,000) is significant if the product is low quality

Since the expected value is less than the cost and there's no track record to rely on, it would be financially prudent to decline.

3. Considerations:
- No sales history to reference
- Alice recommends buying
- Expected value ($960,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000)
- The difference is negative (-$40,000)

Since the expected value is less than the asking price, it would not be rational to buy the product.

3. Alice recommends buying, but since there's no track record yet, her recommendation carries uncertain weight

4. The expected value ($960,000) is less than the asking price ($1,000,000), meaning on average I would lose $40,000

Even with Alice's positive recommendation, the expected value being below the asking price makes this a risky investment.
