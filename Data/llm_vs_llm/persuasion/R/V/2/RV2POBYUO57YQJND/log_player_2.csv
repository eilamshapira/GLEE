Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the provided information, there has been 1 high-quality product sold out of 1 product transaction. Alice recommends buying, which may indicate the product is likely high quality.

Given that:
- Alice has a strong incentive to recommend products truthfully when they are high quality due to her knowledge of the product quality and to maintain a track record that encourages future buyers.
- So far, there has only been one product sold, and it was high quality.

Therefore, the recommendation along with the current sales record suggests the product is likely high quality.

"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the statistics:

- 2 buyers have purchased the product so far.
- Both products purchased were high-quality.

Alice recommends not buying the product, which may indicate a lower likelihood of it being high quality. However, given the 100% success rate from her previous recommendations (though based on a small sample size), it seems probable she is trustworthy when recommending purchases.

Thus, based on Alice's current recommendation of not purchasing, it would be reasonable not to buy the product.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information:

- There have been 2 buyers so far, and both have purchased their products.
- Both of these purchased products were high-quality.
- Alice recommends you to buy this current product.

With this track record, it seems Alice has only recommended high-quality products to buyers so far. This increases the likelihood that if Alice recommends a product, it's of high quality.

Taking this into consideration, it's more likely that this product is high quality given Alice's recommendation. Therefore, a decision to buy the product would be reasonable.

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make a decision, we can consider the following points:

1. Alice recommended you to buy the product. This suggests that it has a higher chance of being high-quality.
2. All previous recommendations (3 buyers) led to buying and all resulted in high-quality product being sold, indicating Alice's recommendations have been reliable so far.

Given this information, here's the JSON decision:

```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```"
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 4 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 4 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 5th buyer!

~

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make a decision on whether to buy the current product, let's analyze the provided information:

1. Alice has sold 4 products, and all 4 were high-quality.
2. Alice is recommending the current product.

Given these statistics, the probability of receiving a high-quality product based on past sales is 100% because all previously sold products were high-quality. The recommendation from Alice, who knows the product's quality, further supports high confidence in its value.

Considering the value of the products:
- High quality: Worth $4,000,000 to you
- Low quality: Worth $0 to you
- Price: $1,000,000

Since the expected benefit of buying a high-quality product (which has been consistent in Alice's sales so far) is significantly higher than the cost, and Alice recommends purchasing it, the decision is:
