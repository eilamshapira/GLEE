Alice's message: Hello! I'm offering a product today for $1000000. While I can't disclose specific details about the product, I can assure you that the vast majority of my offerings are of excellent quality. Based on my past sales, 80% of products I've offered have been high-quality. Are you interested?

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully.

The key information:
- Price: $1,000,000
- If high quality (80% chance): worth $1,200,000 to me (profit of $200,000)
- If low quality (20% chance): worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000)

Expected value calculation:
0.8 × $1,200,000 + 0.2 × $0 - $1,000,000 = $960,000 - $1,000,000 = -$40,000

Since the expected value is negative, it's not rational for me to purchase the product.

Alice's message: Good day! I have a product available for $1000000. I'm proud to say that I consistently offer high-quality items. In fact, 80% of my past sales have been high-quality products. Would you like to hear more?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Since Alice hasn't sold any products yet (as indicated in the statistics), I need to make my decision based on the prior probabilities in this game.

The product has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $1,200,000) and a 20% chance of being low quality (worth $0).

Expected value of buying = 0.8 × $1,200,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $960,000

Since the price is $1,000,000, which is higher than the expected value of $960,000, it's not a rational decision to buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate this purchase decision carefully.

The product costs $1,000,000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this rationally. 

The seller claims 80% of past sales were high-quality products, but the statistics show no products have been sold yet. This inconsistency is concerning.

Looking at the expected value:
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $1,200,000) = $960,000
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0) = $0
- Total expected value = $960,000

The asking price is $1,000,000, which exceeds the expected value of $960,000.

Without any verified sales history or specific information about this product's quality, the purchase represents a negative expected value proposition.

Alice stated that 80% of her past sales were high-quality, but the statistics show that no products have been sold yet, so there is no sales history to verify this claim.
