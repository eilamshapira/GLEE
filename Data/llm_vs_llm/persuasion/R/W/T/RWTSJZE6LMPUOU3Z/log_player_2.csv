Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information provided, I need to make a decision about whether to buy the product.

The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $1,200,000) and 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0).
The price is $1,000,000.
Alice, who knows the true quality, does not recommend that I buy the product.

Since Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase, this suggests the product is likely low quality. If I bought a low-quality product, I would pay $1,000,000 for something worth $0, resulting in a significant loss.

The expected value of buying without any information would be (0.5 × $1,200,000) + (0.5 × $0) - $1,000,000 = $600,000 - $1,000,000 = -$400,000.

However, with Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of the product being high quality is likely much lower than 50%, making the expected value even worse.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to assess whether it's rational to buy the product based on the available information.

The product costs $1,000,000.
- If high quality: I gain $1,200,000 (value) - $1,000,000 (cost) = $200,000
- If low quality: I lose $1,000,000

Without additional information, the expected value is:
0.5 × $200,000 + 0.5 × (-$1,000,000) = $100,000 - $500,000 = -$400,000

Alice has recommended buying the product. Since she knows the true quality, her recommendation might provide useful information. However, I don't have any track record of Alice's past recommendations to assess her credibility. Without knowing if Alice's incentives align with mine, I can't determine if her recommendation is reliable.

Given the significant potential loss and the lack of information about Alice's reliability, the rational choice is to decline.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully:

1) Alice knows the product's true quality (high or low)
2) She's not recommending I buy it
3) A high-quality product would give me a $200,000 profit, while a low-quality product would result in a $1,000,000 loss
4) There's no prior sales history to evaluate Alice's recommendation patterns

Given that Alice knows the product quality and is explicitly recommending against purchase, combined with the asymmetric risk (potential gain is much smaller than potential loss), it seems rational to follow her recommendation in this case.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

The product costs $1,000,000. If it's high quality, it's worth $1,200,000 to me (so I'd gain $200,000), and if it's low quality, it's worth $0 (so I'd lose $1,000,000).

Given a 50% chance of each outcome, my expected value is:
0.5 × $200,000 + 0.5 × (-$1,000,000) = $100,000 - $500,000 = -$400,000

Alice has recommended I buy the product. However, since there are no previous sales, I have no data on how reliable her recommendations are. Her incentive is to sell the product regardless of quality.

Without evidence of Alice's trustworthiness and given the negative expected value, I should decline.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Alice is recommending that I buy the product, which costs $1,000,000.

If the product is high quality (50% chance), it's worth $1,200,000 to me, giving me a profit of $200,000.
If the product is low quality (50% chance), it's worth $0 to me, resulting in a loss of $1,000,000.

The expected value is:
0.5 × $200,000 + 0.5 × (-$1,000,000) = $100,000 - $500,000 = -$400,000

Since the expected value is negative, and I have no information about Alice's honesty in her recommendations (there's no sales record yet), the rational decision is to decline.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to carefully consider the expected value of buying this product. 

Alice recommends buying the product, but I need to evaluate whether this recommendation is trustworthy.

Given the information:
- 50% chance of high quality ($1,200,000 value)
- 50% chance of low quality ($0 value)
- Price is $1,000,000
- No sales history yet to judge Alice's recommendation patterns

The expected value without additional information would be:
0.5 × $1,200,000 + 0.5 × $0 = $600,000

This is less than the $1,000,000 asking price.

Alice's recommendation could potentially signal that the product is high quality, but without a track record of her recommendations, I can't determine if her recommendation is reliable.

Since the expected value based on prior probabilities is less than the asking price, I'll decline.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation carefully.

Alice knows the true quality of the product and has chosen not to recommend it to me. Since Alice has full information about the product's quality, her recommendation is significant.

Given that:
- A high-quality product would give me a surplus of $200,000
- A low-quality product would result in a loss of $1,000,000
- The prior probability is 50% for each quality level
- Alice has specifically recommended against buying

Alice's recommendation not to buy strongly suggests that the product is low quality. Without any previous sales data to consider, I should take her recommendation seriously, especially given the asymmetric payoffs (potential gain vs. potential loss).

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this carefully.

Alice is offering a product for $1,000,000. The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $1,200,000 to me) and a 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me).

Alice reveals the true quality of the product and gives me a recommendation based on that. She's recommending that I buy this product.

Since Alice knows the true quality and is recommending I buy it, this suggests the product is high quality (worth $1,200,000). If I buy it for $1,000,000, my expected profit would be $200,000.

Alice has no sales history yet, so I can't evaluate her historical trustworthiness, but given her recommendation is based on knowing the true quality, it's rational to trust this initial recommendation.

- Each product costs $1,000,000
- High-quality products are worth $1,200,000 to me (profit of $200,000)
- Low-quality products are worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000)
- The prior probability is 50% for high-quality and 50% for low-quality
- Alice has sold 1 product so far, and it was high-quality
- Alice is recommending that I buy the product

Since Alice knows the quality and has an incentive to sell, her recommendation alone isn't necessarily reliable. However, the historical data shows that she has only sold high-quality products so far. This is a positive signal, though with just one previous sale, the sample size is very small.

Given the expected value calculation and the limited but positive track record, I'll purchase the product.

Looking at the statistics:
- 2 previous buyers purchased products based on Alice's recommendations
- 2 high-quality products have been sold
- Alice does NOT recommend I buy the current product

Since Alice has sold only high-quality products so far (2 out of 2), and she is now recommending against this purchase, it strongly suggests this is a low-quality product. Alice seems to be giving honest recommendations. If I buy a low-quality product, I would lose my entire $1,000,000 investment.

The product costs $1,000,000, which is higher than the expected value of $600,000 without additional information.

However, Alice's recommendation and perfect track record (2/2 high-quality products sold) suggests she is being truthful about the product quality. If I trust her recommendation, the expected value would be $1,200,000, which exceeds the $1,000,000 price.
