{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since there's no prior data on the quality of the products, and Alice is not recommending the product, the risk of getting a low-quality product is too high. It's better to pass and wait for more information or another opportunity."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since there's no prior information about product quality, and Alice recommends buying, it's a 50/50 chance. The potential reward ($200) outweighs the potential loss ($0). It's a gamble, but a rational one given the lack of information."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is valuable information. Since she recommends buying, it suggests she believes the product is likely to be high quality.  Given the 50/50 probability, and the fact that one high-quality product was already sold, it's reasonable to assume the odds are in our favor. The potential gain ($200) outweighs the potential loss ($0)."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice is not recommending the product. This suggests that the product is likely low quality. 
* **Sales history:**  While 2 out of 2 products sold were high quality, this is a very small sample size. It's possible that the products sold were simply lucky draws. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward for buying (a high-quality product worth $200) is outweighed by the risk of buying a low-quality product worth $0. 

Given the lack of information and the negative recommendation, passing on the product is the safer strategy."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Previous Data:** 100% of the products sold so far have been high quality. This is a strong indicator that Alice's recommendations are accurate. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, further increasing the likelihood of it being high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the product is low quality (which is unlikely based on the data), you only lose $100.  But if it's high quality, you gain $100. The potential reward outweighs the risk."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. She has access to the product's true quality and has chosen not to recommend it to you.
* **Previous Sales Data:**  The data suggests a 100% success rate for high-quality products. This is likely due to small sample size, but it's still a positive sign.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While the potential reward is high ($200), the risk of getting a worthless product is also significant.  Alice's recommendation, coupled with the uncertainty of the product, makes passing the best option."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since all the previous buyers who followed her recommendation ended up with high-quality products, it's likely she knows how to identify them. Given her recommendation against buying, the product is likely low-quality, which is worth $0 to me. Therefore, I choose to pass."

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:** All products recommended by Alice so far have been high quality. This is a strong indicator that she is accurately identifying good products. 
* **No Risk:** Since all previously recommended products were good, there is no risk in buying this one. The potential reward ($200) significantly outweighs the potential loss ($0)."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since she has a perfect track record (7 high-quality products sold) and is not recommending the product, it's highly likely that the product is of low quality.  It's more rational to pass on the product and avoid a potential loss."

**Explanation:**
