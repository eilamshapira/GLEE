Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided: 
- Both of the previous sales resulted in high-quality products. 
- Alice is currently not recommending the purchase.

Here's the analysis:
- Past sales have been entirely high-quality, suggesting that Alice might be good at selecting high-quality products.
- Alice's current lack of recommendation could imply that this product is low quality.

Taking this into account, it appears that the probability of receiving a low-quality product is high given Alice's recommendation history. Therefore, the decision would be:

{""decision"": ""no""}

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the data that two high-quality products have been sold and both buyers purchased the recommended products, Alice's recommendation to buy suggests a high probability that the current product is also high-quality. Thus, the expected value of purchasing, based on the track record, appears favorable.
