Alice's message: Hello! I'm excited to offer you a premium product that has a 50% chance of being high-quality, worth $4000000 to the right buyer. While I am transparent that all products in my inventory have this same probability, I believe this particular item has excellent potential. The asking price of $1000000 represents a significant opportunity for value, as the expected value is $2000000 (50% chance of $4000000).

Alice's message: Welcome! I'm offering you an exclusive product from my collection, priced at $1000000. As you may know, my products have a 50% chance of being high-quality (worth $4000000) and 50% chance of being low-quality. I believe in complete transparency, so I want to share that so far, I've sold 1 product, though that particular one turned out to be low-quality. However, each product is independent, maintaining the same 50% probability of being high-quality. The expected value remains $2000000, making this a potentially valuable opportunity. I'm committed to building a reputation for honest dealings in all my transactions. Would you like to proceed with this investment opportunity?

Alice's message: Greetings! Thank you for considering my exclusive product offering. I want to be completely transparent with you - I've sold 2 products so far, and while both were of the lower quality tier, please remember that each product has an independent 50% chance of being high-quality (worth $4000000). This statistical distribution means that high-quality products are still equally likely to appear in my inventory. At the price point of $1000000, the expected value remains $2000000, which represents a significant potential return on investment. While past results don't predict future outcomes, the probability fundamentals remain unchanged. I'm committed to building long-term business relationships based on honesty. Would you like to proceed with this potentially valuable investment opportunity?

Alice's message: Hello, and thank you for your interest! I want to be fully transparent with you about my track record. I've sold 3 products to date, and by random chance, all three happened to be of lower quality. However, it's important to understand that this doesn't change the fundamental probability that each new product has a 50% chance of being high-quality (worth $4000000). Much like how a fair coin that shows heads three times in a row still has a 50% chance of showing tails on the next flip, this product maintains its 50% chance of being high-quality. At $1000000, the expected value remains $2000000, representing a significant potential opportunity. I value honest business practices and long-term relationships with my customers.

Alice's message: Hello! I'm excited to share an opportunity with you today. In the interest of complete transparency, I've sold 4 products so far, and due to statistical variance, all four happened to be of lower quality. However, I'm particularly optimistic about this current offering. Each product maintains an independent 50% probability of being high-quality (worth $4000000), regardless of past outcomes. Similar to how a fair coin might land on heads multiple times before eventually showing tails, the probability fundamentals remain unchanged. At $1000000, with the expected value of $2000000, this represents a significant potential opportunity. I'm committed to building my business on integrity and transparency.
