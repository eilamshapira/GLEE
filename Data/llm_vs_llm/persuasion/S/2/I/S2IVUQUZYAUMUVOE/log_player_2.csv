{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

To explain my strategy, I'm buying the product each time because the expected value is in my favor. Given the probabilities and the payouts, the expected value for each product is:

\( \text{Expected Value} = (0.80 \times \$1,250,000) + (0.20 \times \$0) = \$1,000,000 \)

Since the expected value equals the cost of the product, over many rounds, I expect to break even at worst, and potentially profit if the high-quality products appear more frequently than the low-quality ones."
