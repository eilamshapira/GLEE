"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this rationally:

1. The price is fixed at $100
2. High quality (worth $200) has 50% chance
3. Low quality (worth $0) has 50% chance
4. Expected value without any other information = (0.5 × $200) + (0.5 × $0) = $100

Since Alice knows the true quality and is recommending to buy, this might be a positive signal. However, since this is the first round, I don't yet know if Alice's recommendations are trustworthy.

Given that the expected value equals the price ($100), and there's a potential positive signal from Alice's recommendation, I'll take a chance.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. In Round 1, Alice recommended buying and the product was indeed high quality - this suggests Alice might be honest in her recommendations
2. Now Alice is recommending NOT to buy
3. If Alice is being honest, this likely means it's a low-quality product
4. Without Alice's recommendation, expected value would be $100 (same as price)
5. Given Alice's previous truthful recommendation and current negative recommendation, probability of this being low quality is likely higher than 50%
6. This would make expected value less than $100, making it a bad purchase

Since Alice proved truthful in Round 1 and is now warning against buying, I'll trust her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze Alice's track record:

1. Round 1: Alice recommended buying -> Product was high quality (truthful)
2. Round 2: Alice recommended not buying -> Product was low quality (truthful)
3. Now Alice is recommending to buy again

So far, Alice has been completely honest in her recommendations, and she seems to be acting in a way that helps the buyer make profitable decisions. Her recommendations have perfectly matched the actual product quality in both previous rounds.

Given that:
- Alice has been truthful twice
- She's now recommending to buy
- She knows the true quality
- She has demonstrated a pattern of honest recommendations

I will trust her recommendation.

"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
