"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation.

Alice is offering a product with a fixed price of $1,000,000. For me (Bob):
- High-quality product value: $2,000,000 (profit of $1,000,000)
- Low-quality product value: $0 (loss of $1,000,000)

Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending this product. Since the prior probability is 50% for high quality and 50% for low quality, and Alice has inside information, her recommendation is valuable information.

If Alice is not recommending the product, it's likely because it's low quality. It wouldn't make sense for her to discourage me from buying a high-quality product since she gets the same $1,000,000 either way.

Following her recommendation is the rational choice here.
