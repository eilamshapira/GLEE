Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (80% chance): $30,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value = (0.8 × $30,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $24,000

The expected value ($24,000) is significantly higher than the price ($10,000), and Alice is recommending the purchase. Even though there's no previous sales history to verify Alice's credibility, the favorable probability distribution makes this a positive expected value decision.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price of product: $10,000
2. Value if high quality: $30,000 (profit: $20,000)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss: $10,000)
4. Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
5. Previous sales data: 1 buyer, 1 high-quality sale
6. Alice recommended buying

The fact that Alice sold 1 high-quality product and is recommending this one is a positive sign. The expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of $20,000 profit = $16,000
- 20% chance of $10,000 loss = -$2,000
Net expected value = $14,000

Since the expected value is positive and Alice's track record shows honesty so far, I'll buy.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $10,000
2. Expected value calculation:
   * High quality (80%): $30,000 × 0.8 = $24,000
   * Low quality (20%): $0 × 0.2 = $0
   * Total expected value: $24,000

3. Track record:
   * 2 previous buyers
   * 2 high-quality products sold
   * This matches the expected 80% high-quality rate
   * Alice's recommendations have been accurate

4. Alice's recommendation:
   * She recommends buying
   * She knows the true product value
   * Her previous recommendations led to successful sales

The expected value ($24,000) is significantly higher than the price ($10,000), and Alice's track record shows honesty. With her positive recommendation and the favorable statistics, buying is the rational choice.

4. Value if low quality: $0
5. Track record: 3 out of 3 previous sales were high quality (100%)
6. Alice recommends buying

This is a good situation because:
- The expected value without any additional information (0.8 × $30,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $24,000) is already higher than the price
- Alice's perfect track record so far (3/3 high quality) further increases confidence
- Alice's recommendation is positive

- This suggests Alice has been honest in her recommendations

2. Current situation:

- If low quality: I lose $10,000
- If high quality: I gain $20,000 ($30,000 - $10,000)
