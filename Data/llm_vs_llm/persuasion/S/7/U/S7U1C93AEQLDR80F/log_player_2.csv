"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this rationally:

1. Price: $10,000
2. If high quality: Worth $20,000 (profit: +$10,000)
3. If low quality: Worth $0 (loss: -$10,000)
4. Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
5. Expected value without considering Alice's recommendation: 
   (50% × $20,000) + (50% × $0) - $10,000 = $0

Since Alice is recommending the purchase, and she's seeing the actual quality, she might be giving honest advice. However, as a seller, she has an incentive to always recommend buying regardless of quality.

In this first round, without any pattern of behavior to base trust on, I should treat her recommendation as potentially biased and rely on the base probabilities.

With a 50/50 chance and equal potential gain/loss, the expected value is neutral. In such cases, it's generally better to be conservative.

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Interesting development from Round 1:

1. Alice recommended a low-quality product in Round 1, which suggests she might be recommending purchases regardless of quality
2. This confirms my suspicion that her recommendations might not be reliable
3. The base probabilities and stakes remain the same:
   - 50% chance of high quality ($20,000 value)
   - 50% chance of low quality ($0 value)
   - Price still $10,000
   - Expected value still $0

Given that:
1. Alice has shown she will recommend buying a low-quality product
2. The expected value without reliable information is $0
3. We've seen one instance of potentially deceptive behavior

It's safer to maintain a conservative approach until we have more information about Alice's behavior patterns.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is getting very interesting:

1. Past results:
   - Round 1: Alice recommended low-quality (avoided $10,000 loss)
   - Round 2: Alice recommended low-quality (avoided $10,000 loss)
   - Round 3: Alice is recommending again

2. Pattern emerging:
   - Alice has recommended buying in all three rounds
   - The two products we've seen were both low-quality
   - This suggests Alice is likely recommending ALL products regardless of quality

3. The base math remains the same, but we now have evidence that:
   - Alice's recommendations appear unreliable
   - She seems to be acting purely in her interest as a seller
   - There's a developing pattern of deceptive recommendations

Given this emerging pattern of behavior, and that we've already avoided $20,000 in potential losses by not trusting the recommendations, the rational choice is to continue being skeptical.

1. Previous rounds:
   - Round 1: Recommended low-quality (good skip)
   - Round 2: Recommended low-quality (good skip)
   - Round 3: Recommended high-quality (missed opportunity, -$10,000 potential profit)
   - Round 4: Recommending again

2. Updated analysis:
   - Alice seems to recommend buying ALL products regardless of quality
   - We've now seen 2 low-quality and 1 high-quality products
   - The underlying 50/50 probability appears to hold true
   - Alice's recommendations provide no additional information

3. Expected value calculation remains:
   - 50% chance of +$10,000 profit (high-quality)
   - 50% chance of -$10,000 loss (low-quality)
   - Expected value = $0

While we missed a profitable opportunity in Round 3, this doesn't change the fundamental mathematics. With an expected value of $0 and Alice's recommendations proving meaningless, the conservative approach is still rational.

2. Pattern analysis:
   - Alice has recommended buying in all rounds (100%)
   - Of the 4 products seen: 3 low-quality, 1 high-quality (75%/25%)
   - This confirms Alice is recommending regardless of quality
   - Her recommendations provide zero informational value

3. Our performance:
   - Avoided 3 losses (-$30,000)
   - Missed 1 gain (+$10,000)
   - Net benefit of our strategy: +$20,000

3. Expected value remains $0:

   - Final round after this one

Despite recent missed opportunities and only one round remaining, the fundamental mechanics haven't changed:
- We can't predict quality
- Alice's recommendations provide no information
- Expected value is still $0
- Strategy remains significantly profitable overall

With just one round remaining and +$40,000 in net benefit, maintaining our consistent approach remains rational.

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 20
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Final round analysis:

1. Complete history:
   - Round 1-14: (10 low, 4 high)
   - Round 15: High-quality (missed opportunity)
   - Round 16: High-quality (missed opportunity)
   - Round 17: Low-quality (good skip)
   - Round 18: High-quality (missed opportunity)
   - Round 19: Low-quality (good skip)
   - Round 20: Recommending again (final round)

2. Final statistics:
   - Seen 19 products: 12 low-quality, 7 high-quality (63%/37%)
   - Current strategy results:
     * Avoided twelve losses (+$120,000 saved)
     * Missed seven gains (-$70,000 potential profit)
     * Net benefit: +$50,000
   - Alice recommended every single product

3. Final decision considerations:
   - Just avoided another loss
   - Net benefit back up to +$50,000
   - Expected value still $0
   - Alice's recommendations proved meaningless throughout
   - This is the last chance to change strategy

Even in this final round, the fundamental mechanics remain unchanged:
- We can't predict quality
- Base probability should still be 50/50
- Expected value is still $0
- Our strategy has been consistently profitable

No reason to change our successful strategy on the final round.
