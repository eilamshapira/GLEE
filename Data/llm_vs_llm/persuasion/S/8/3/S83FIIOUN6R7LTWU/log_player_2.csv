"Round 1
Alice's message: I have a great product to offer you for just $10000. It has some unique features that make it a valuable addition to your collection. Given that there is a 50% chance it's high-quality, I highly recommend you consider this opportunity!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate this situation logically. 

For each product:
- 50% chance it's high quality (worth $40,000 to me)
- 50% chance it's low quality (worth $0 to me)
- Cost to buy is $10,000

Expected value calculation:
0.5 × $40,000 + 0.5 × $0 - $10,000 = $20,000 - $10,000 = $10,000

With a positive expected value of $10,000, it makes sense to buy this product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I'm excited to present another fantastic product for just $10000! It comes with some interesting features that could be beneficial for you. Remember, there's still a chance this product could be high-quality. Don't miss out on this opportunity!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to continue evaluating each offer independently, as each product has the same 50% probability of being high or low quality, regardless of previous outcomes.

For this product:
- 50% chance it's high quality (worth $40,000 to me)
- 50% chance it's low quality (worth $0 to me)
- Cost to buy is $10,000

Expected value calculation:
0.5 × $40,000 + 0.5 × $0 - $10,000 = $20,000 - $10,000 = $10,000

The expected value is positive at $10,000, so it's still rational to buy this product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.
