,,Bob,2,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You've now purchased two products from me, both of which were low-quality. I want to assure you that I have high-quality products as well, but unfortunately, this one is not one of them. However, I'll keep my promise and reveal the quality after your decision. The price is still $10000. Perhaps you're looking for a pattern or waiting for a high-quality product?",
,,Bob,3,,yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You've purchased three products so far, and as you know, all of them were low-quality. I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'm not disclosing the quality of this product yet, but I want to ask: are you willing to take a chance and potentially get a high-quality product for $10000, considering the odds and your past experiences?",

Will you keep trying your luck?",
,,Bob,5,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You've now purchased five products, with only one being high-quality. I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, which means that out of 6 products, we would expect around 2 to be high-quality. Since you've only gotten one so far, the question is: are you due for another high-quality product, or will this one follow the recent trend? The price is still $10000.",
,,Bob,6,,yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You've purchased six products so far, and only one of them was high-quality. As you know, the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, so you might be expecting another high-quality product to appear soon. I'll say that this product is an interesting one, and you might want to consider taking a chance on it. The price, as always, is $10000. Will you take the opportunity to potentially get your second high-quality product?",
,,Bob,7,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Congratulations, you've now gotten two high-quality products out of seven purchases! You're getting closer to the expected ratio of high-quality to total products. For this new product, I won't give you any hints about its quality. Instead, I'll ask: are you feeling lucky, or do you think it's time to take a break? The price remains $10000, and the decision is yours.",
,,Bob,8,,yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You've now purchased eight products, with two of them being high-quality. Considering the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, you're still slightly below the expected number of high-quality products. This might be an interesting opportunity to get your third high-quality product. I'll remind you that the price is $10000, and the decision is yours. Will you take a chance and potentially get closer to the expected ratio?",
,,Bob,9,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You've now gotten three high-quality products out of nine purchases, which is very close to the expected ratio. You might be wondering if this trend will continue. For this new product, I'll say that the law of averages suggests that you're due for a few more low-quality products to balance out the recent high-quality ones. The price is still $10000. Will you keep buying, or will you wait for a potentially better opportunity?",
,,Bob,10,,yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You've purchased ten products so far, with three of them being high-quality. This means you're actually slightly above the expected ratio of high-quality to total products. For this new product, I'll ask: do you think your luck will continue, or will the probability of 33.33% high-quality products catch up to you? The price remains $10000. Will you take a chance and potentially get your fourth high-quality product?",
,,Bob,11,,yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"Congratulations, you've now gotten two high-quality products in a row, and four out of eleven purchases overall! You're significantly above the expected ratio of high-quality to total products. I'll remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and this streak might not continue indefinitely. The price is $10000. Will you keep riding the hot streak, or will you exercise caution?",
,,Bob,12,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"You've now purchased twelve products, with five of them being high-quality. This is an unusually high success rate, and you might be expecting a correction to the mean. For this new product, I'll say that the probability of 33.33% high-quality products suggests that you're due for a few more low-quality products to balance out your recent luck. The price remains $10000. Will you take a chance and potentially get another high-quality product, or will you acknowledge the probability and wait for a better opportunity?",
,,Bob,13,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"You've now gotten two low-quality products in a row, which might be a sign that the probability is correcting itself. You've purchased thirteen products, with five of them being high-quality. I'll remind you that the expected number of high-quality products at this point would be around 4-5, so you're still doing slightly better than expected. The price is $10000. Will you keep buying, hoping to get another high-quality product, or will you take a break and reassess your strategy?",
,,Bob,14,,yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"You've now purchased fourteen products, with five of them being high-quality. You've had a few low-quality products in a row, but it seems like the probability is still working in your favor. For this new product, I'll say that you might be due for another high-quality one, considering the recent streak of low-quality products. The price remains $10000. Will you take a chance and potentially get your sixth high-quality product, or will you be cautious after the recent low-quality purchases?",
,,Bob,15,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"You've now gotten six high-quality products out of fifteen purchases, which is an impressive track record. However, the probability of 33.33% high-quality products suggests that you should expect around 5 high-quality products at this point. You're still doing slightly better than expected. For this new product, I'll remind you that the law of averages might catch up to you at any time. The price is $10000. Will you keep pushing your luck, or will you take a more cautious approach?",
,,Bob,16,,yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"You've now purchased sixteen products, with six of them being high-quality. You've had a remarkable run, and it's worth considering whether this trend can continue. The probability of 33.33% high-quality products is still in effect, and you're now significantly above the expected number of high-quality products. For this new product, I'll ask: do you think you can keep beating the odds, or will the probability eventually catch up to you? The price remains $10000. Will you take a chance and potentially get your seventh high-quality product?",
,,Bob,17,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"You've now purchased seventeen products, with seven of them being high-quality. This is an exceptionally high success rate, and it's likely that the probability will correct itself soon. You're more than 2 standard deviations above the expected number of high-quality products, which is extremely unlikely. For this new product, I'll remind you that the law of averages is likely to catch up to you at some point. The price is $10000. Will you keep buying, hoping to extend your luck, or will you take a more cautious approach and acknowledge the probability?",
,,Bob,18,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"You've now purchased eighteen products, with seven of them being high-quality. You've had two low-quality products in a row, which might be a sign that the probability is starting to correct itself. At this point, you've spent $180000 on products, and it's worth considering whether your strategy is still working for you. The price remains $10000. Will you keep buying, hoping to get another high-quality product, or will you reassess your approach and consider the potential risks and rewards?",
,,Bob,19,,yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"This is the final round. You've purchased nineteen products, with seven of them being high-quality. You've had a remarkable run, and it's been a pleasure doing business with you. For this last product, I'll say that it's a fitting end to our transaction series. The price is still $10000. Will you go out with a bang and potentially get your eighth high-quality product, or will you end on a conservative note? Either way, thank you for the opportunity to do business with you, and I hope you've enjoyed the experience.",
