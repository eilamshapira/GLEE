"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The expected value of any product before knowing Alice's recommendation is:
   * 50% chance of high quality ($20,000) = $10,000
   * 50% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
   * Total expected value = $10,000

2. Alice is not recommending this product, which likely means it's low quality.

3. Given this is the first round, we should take Alice's recommendation seriously as she has no reason to deceive us yet.

4. If it's likely a low-quality product, the expected value would be below $10,000, making it a bad purchase at the asking price.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. In Round 1, Alice was honest - she didn't recommend a low-quality product.

2. Now she's recommending this product, which suggests:
   * She's being honest so far
   * This product is likely high quality
   * If high quality, it's worth $20,000 to me

3. Given that:
   * The price is $10,000
   * Alice has been truthful so far
   * She's actively recommending this product
   * A high-quality product would give me $10,000 in profit

4. Since Alice has shown herself to be truthful in Round 1 and is now making a positive recommendation, this seems like a good opportunity.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"

The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

   * She has been completely honest in both rounds

2. Current situation:
   * Alice is recommending this product
   * Her recommendations have been reliable
   * If it's high-quality (which seems likely given her recommendation), I'll profit $10,000
   * Risk seems low given her established credibility

3. There's no apparent reason for Alice to start being deceptive now, as maintaining trust would be more valuable for future rounds.

Given Alice's perfect track record and continued trustworthy behavior, I should continue to trust her recommendation.
