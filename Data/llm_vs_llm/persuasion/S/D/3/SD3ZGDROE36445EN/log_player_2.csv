Alice recommends you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since there's no sales history, you have no information to go on other than Alice's recommendation. As Alice knows the true quality and is recommending you buy, it's statistically likely that the product is high quality (50% chance).  The potential reward of $120 outweighs the risk of losing $100."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Prior Information:** You know that high-quality products are worth $120 to you and low-quality products are worth $0.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. This is valuable information because she knows the true quality of the product.
* **Sales Record:**  The sales record is limited, but it shows that 1 high-quality product has been sold. This is a positive sign, suggesting that Alice might be recommending high-quality products more often.

**Decision:**  While there's still a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, Alice's recommendation and the positive sales record outweigh the risk. Buying the product has the potential for a $120 profit, making it a good gamble."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Information:** The seller's recommendation is a strong signal. Alice has perfect knowledge of the product's quality and is incentivized to recommend only high-quality products to increase sales and her own profits.
* **Past Sales:** The data shows a high proportion of high-quality products sold (2 out of 3). This further strengthens the likelihood of the current product being high quality.
* **Expected Value:**  Even with a 50/50 chance of the product being high or low quality, the potential gain of $120 from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of $100 from a low-quality product.

**Therefore, given the seller's recommendation and the positive sales data, the decision to buy is the best strategy to maximize your potential gains.**"

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. Since Alice knows the true quality of the product, this recommendation carries significant weight.
* **High Sales Rate:**  3 out of 4 previous buyers received high-quality products. This suggests a higher probability of the current product also being high quality.
* **Potential Value:** Even if the product is low quality, the cost is only $100.  However, if it's high quality, the potential profit is $20 ($120 value - $100 cost).

While there's always a risk, the odds seem to favor a purchase in this scenario."
