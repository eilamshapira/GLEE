Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. Price is $10,000
2. High quality (worth $12,000) probability is 33.33%
3. Low quality (worth $0) probability is 66.67%
4. Alice does not recommend buying
5. No prior sales history to reference

Expected value calculation:
* 33.33% chance of $12,000 = $4,000
* 66.67% chance of $0 = $0
* Total expected value = $4,000

Since the price ($10,000) is higher than the expected value ($4,000), and Alice is not recommending the purchase, it would not be rational to buy.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $12,000
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): $0

3. Key factors:
   - Alice doesn't recommend buying
   - No previous sales history to reference
   - Expected value calculation:
     (33.33% × $12,000) + (66.67% × $0) = $4,000

Since Alice doesn't recommend the purchase and the expected value ($4,000) is less than the price ($10,000), it would be risky to buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33%): $12,000 (profit of $2,000)
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0 (loss of $10,000)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (33.33% × $12,000) + (66.67% × $0) - $10,000 = $4,000 - $10,000 = -$6,000

Even with Alice's recommendation, the expected value is negative. Without any track record of previous sales to establish trust, and given that Alice has an incentive to sell regardless of quality, it's too risky.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. No prior sales history, so we can't use past data for reference
2. Base probability of product quality:
   * High quality (worth $12,000): 33.33%
   * Low quality (worth $0): 66.67%
3. Price is $10,000
4. Alice doesn't recommend buying
5. Expected value calculation:
   * (0.3333 × $12,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $4,000

The seller has no incentive to lie, as building a bad reputation would hurt future sales. If they don't recommend the product, it's likely low quality.

Given that:
- The expected value ($4,000) is less than the price ($10,000)
- The seller doesn't recommend it
- There's a high risk of getting a worthless product
