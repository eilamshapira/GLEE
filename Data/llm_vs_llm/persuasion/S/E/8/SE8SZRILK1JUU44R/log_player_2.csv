Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $1,000,000
2. If high quality (33.33% chance): Worth $4,000,000 (profit: $3,000,000)
3. If low quality (66.67% chance): Worth $0 (loss: $1,000,000)

Expected value calculation:
- (33.33% × $3,000,000) + (66.67% × -$1,000,000)
- $1,000,000 - $666,700
- ≈ $333,300

Even though Alice recommends buying the product, I have no historical data to assess her trustworthiness. However, the expected value is positive ($333,300), which makes it a mathematically sound decision to buy.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. Alice has sold 1 product so far, and it was high quality
2. Alice is not recommending this product to me
3. Given Alice's past behavior showing honesty (selling high quality previously) and now actively discouraging me from buying, this suggests she's being truthful
4. Since she knows the true quality and is not recommending it, this product is likely low quality
5. A low quality product would be worth $0 to me, while costing $1,000,000

The rational choice would be to follow Alice's recommendation and not buy.

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $4,000,000
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): $0

3. Previous statistics:
   - 1 buyer before me
   - 1 high-quality product sold
   - Alice's track record so far is positive (100% high quality)

4. Current situation:
   - Alice does NOT recommend buying
   - Given Alice has been honest before and knows the true quality
   - Her negative recommendation strongly suggests this is a low-quality product

The fact that Alice doesn't recommend the purchase, combined with her previous honest behavior (selling high-quality product), suggests she's being truthful. This likely means the current product is low quality and worth $0.

- Alice knows the true value
- Price is $1,000,000
- 33.33% chance of high quality ($4M value)
- 66.67% chance of low quality ($0 value)

Given that Alice has been honest before (100% high-quality sales) and she's not recommending this product, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. Since a low-quality product would be worth $0, buying it for $1M would be a loss.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Price = $1,000,000
2. If high quality: Value = $4,000,000 (Profit = $3,000,000)
3. If low quality: Value = $0 (Loss = -$1,000,000)
4. Base probability: 33.33% high quality, 66.67% low quality

Looking at the track record:
- Previous buyer bought and got a high-quality product
- Alice is recommending this product

Given that:
1. Alice has proven honest with the previous buyer
2. She's recommending this product
3. Expected value with base probabilities:
   (0.3333 × $4,000,000) + (0.6667 × $0) - $1,000,000 = $333,200 (positive)

The positive track record and recommendation make this look like a good deal.

1. Previous track record:
- 2 buyers so far
- 2 high-quality products sold
- This shows Alice has been honest so far

2. Current situation:
- Alice is not recommending the product
- Given her honest track record, this likely means it's a low-quality product
- If it's low-quality, it's worth $0 to me
- The price is $1,000,000

3. Risk assessment:
- Alice's previous recommendations led to successful high-quality purchases
- She's now explicitly recommending against buying
- The potential loss ($1,000,000) is significant if it's low quality
- Even though there's a 33.33% base chance of high quality, Alice's recommendation suggests it's likely low quality

Given Alice's proven honest track record and her negative recommendation, the rational choice is not to buy.

3. Reasoning:
