Let me explain briefly my reasoning. The product is offered at a fixed price of $100. If it turns out to be high quality (worth $300 to you), you gain $200 net; if it is low quality (worth $0), you lose $100. The product is randomly high quality 33.33% of the time and low quality 66.67% of the time. That makes the expected net payoff

  EV = 0.3333 × $200 + 0.6667 × (–$100) = approximately $66.67 – $66.67 = $0.

In this setting the “fair bet” yields an expected value of zero. The sales record (9 previous sales with 3 high‐quality products) exactly matches the inherent probabilities, so it doesn’t indicate any hidden “better-than-chance” signal. In addition, while Alice’s recommendation might seem persuasive, the fact that previous recommendations led to the same base rate tells you that her “buy” recommendation does not actually indicate that the current product is more likely to be high quality.

Thus, as a risk‐neutral buyer the gamble is exactly fair. There is no expected loss, and accepting the product means you have a positive return if you get the high-quality product but only a moderate loss when it is low quality. Given that risk neutrality (or even a slight “nothing to lose” attitude since the bet is fair) may lean toward buying, I choose to buy the product.

So, the final answer is to buy it."
