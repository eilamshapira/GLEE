"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

- Each product has a 33.33% chance of being high quality (worth $4M to me) and 66.67% chance of being low quality (worth $0)
- The price is fixed at $1M
- Alice has revealed the product's true quality (to herself) and is recommending I buy it

I need to determine if Alice's recommendation is reliable. Since this is the first round, I don't have information about Alice's recommendation patterns yet.

If I buy:
- Expected value = 0.3333 × $4M + 0.6667 × $0 = $1.33M
- Price = $1M
- Expected profit = $1.33M - $1M = $0.33M

Since the expected value exceeds the price, I should buy.
