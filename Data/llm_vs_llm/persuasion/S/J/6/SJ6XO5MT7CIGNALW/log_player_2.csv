Alice's message: Greetings! I have a product here that offers a unique opportunity. While I can't disclose specifics upfront, I assure you it holds significant potential value, possibly exceeding the asking price considerably. Consider this a venture with substantial upside. Are you ready to invest?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Possible values:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): Worth $12,000 (profit of $2,000)
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): Worth $0 (loss of $10,000)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (0.3333 × $12,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $4,000

The expected value ($4,000) is less than the price ($10,000), making this a negative expected value proposition. Additionally, Alice's message is vague and doesn't provide concrete information about the product's quality.

Alice's message: Hello! I have a limited-availability product that could be extremely valuable. Due to its nature, I can't reveal all the details, but I believe it has the potential to be a game-changer for the right person. It's a premium opportunity at a set price. Are you interested in exploring its potential?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - 33.33% chance of $12,000 (high quality)
   - 66.67% chance of $0 (low quality)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (0.3333 × $12,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $4,000

The expected value ($4,000) is less than the asking price ($10,000).

Additionally:
- No sales history to evaluate Alice's track record
- Alice's message is vague and uses sales-focused language without specific details
- The probability of losing the entire investment (66.67%) is high

Alice's message: Good day! I'm offering a product today with a unique profile. It's a strategic investment opportunity with a defined risk/reward ratio. While the immediate benefits may not be obvious, a deeper look reveals considerable long-term potential. Ready to take a calculated risk for a potentially high reward?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Base probability:
- 33.33% chance of high quality ($12,000 value)
- 66.67% chance of low quality ($0 value)

2. Expected value calculation:
(0.3333 × $12,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $4,000

3. Analysis:
- Price is $10,000
- Expected value is only $4,000
- Alice's message is vague and non-committal
- No previous sales data to reference
- The ""calculated risk"" language suggests uncertainty

Given that the expected value ($4,000) is significantly lower than the asking price ($10,000), and there's no clear positive signal in Alice's message, it would not be rational to purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential outcomes:
   - 33.33% chance of high quality ($12,000 value) = +$2,000 profit
   - 66.67% chance of low quality ($0 value) = -$10,000 loss

3. Expected value calculation:
   (0.3333 × $2,000) + (0.6667 × -$10,000) = -$6,000

4. Alice's message is vague and uses sales language without making any clear claims about quality.

5. There's no previous sales history to evaluate Alice's credibility.

The expected value is negative, and without any reliable track record or clear indication of quality, the risk is too high.

Alice's message: Good day! I have a product available that I believe is significantly undervalued. While I cannot provide specifics at this stage, I am confident that a savvy buyer will recognize the tremendous opportunity it represents.

The expected value ($4,000) is less than the price ($10,000), and Alice's message is vague and seems like generic sales language without specific information about the product's quality.

Since there's no sales history to evaluate Alice's credibility and the expected value is negative, it would be financially unwise to purchase.

3. Expected value calculation:
   (33.33% × $2,000) + (66.67% × -$10,000) = $666.67 - $6,667 = -$6,000

4. Additional considerations:
   - No previous sales history to establish trust
   - Alice's message is vague and non-committal
   - The message seems designed to create FOMO rather than provide concrete information

The expected value is negative (-$6,000), and there are no positive indicators from past sales or clear information in Alice's message to offset this mathematical disadvantage.
