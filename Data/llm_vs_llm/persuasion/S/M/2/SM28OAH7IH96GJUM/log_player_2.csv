"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision:

Expected value of buying = 0.8 * $4,000,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $3,200,000

Round 20
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is interesting - for the first time, Alice is not recommending that I buy the product. This likely means she knows it's a low-quality product.

Let me reconsider the probabilities:
- If Alice is being honest, this is likely a low-quality product
- I should update my expected value calculation based on this new information

Without Alice's recommendation, I would expect:
Expected value = 0.8 * $4,000,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $3,200,000

But with Alice explicitly NOT recommending it, the probability of it being high quality is likely much lower than 80%. Given Alice's pattern of only recommending high-quality products so far, this is almost certainly a low-quality product.

The expected value with this new information is likely much closer to $0, which is less than the cost of $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
