**Reasoning:**

Alice has sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 sales. This is highly unlikely given the 1/3 probability of a high-quality product.  While it's *possible* she's just been incredibly lucky, it's more probable that there's some selection bias at play. Perhaps Alice is only offering products to buyers when she happens to draw a high-quality one.  It's in Alice's best interest to make a sale. Since I don't know the *process* by which she's deciding to show products to customers, the unusually high proportion of high-quality sales so far makes me suspicious. The expected value of a product, given a random draw, is (1/3 * $12,500) + (2/3 * $0) = $4166.67. The asking price is $10,000, significantly higher.  The information provided doesn't justify the risk."

**Reasoning:**

Alice has a perfect record of selling *only* high-quality products so far.  This is statistically extremely unlikely ( (1/3)^5  ) if she is truly offering products randomly.  The fact that she is now explicitly stating this product is *not* high quality strongly suggests she is cherry-picking.  She is only offering the high-quality products to buyers and withholding the low-quality ones.  She is likely trying to establish a reputation for quality to induce later buyers to purchase even when she starts selling the lower quality items.  Since the product is worthless if it is low quality, and I strongly suspect this one is low quality, the expected value is negative. Therefore, I will not buy."
