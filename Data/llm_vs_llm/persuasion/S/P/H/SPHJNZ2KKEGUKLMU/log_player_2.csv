"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think this through:

1. Price is $100
2. If high quality: I gain $400 - $100 = $300
3. If low quality: I lose $100
4. Base probability is 50% for each outcome
5. Alice has incentive to always recommend buying since she makes $100 regardless of quality
6. Therefore, her recommendation doesn't provide additional information

Expected value calculation:
(50% × $300) + (50% × -$100) = $150 + (-$50) = $100 positive expected value

Since the expected value is positive ($100), I should buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The same logic applies as before:

1. Price remains $100
2. High quality profit: $400 - $100 = $300
3. Low quality loss: -$100
4. Still 50-50 probability for each quality
5. Alice's recommendation still doesn't add information since she profits either way

Expected value calculation:
(50% × $300) + (50% × -$100) = $150 + (-$50) = $100 positive expected value

The expected value remains positive ($100), so I should continue to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The fundamental analysis remains unchanged:

1. Price is still $100
2. High quality outcome: +$300 profit ($400 - $100)
3. Low quality outcome: -$100 loss
4. Probability remains 50-50
5. Alice's recommendation still carries no additional information

Expected value calculation:
(50% × $300) + (50% × -$100) = $150 + (-$50) = $100 positive expected value

Since the expected value is still positive ($100), the rational choice is to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The core analysis remains the same:

1. Fixed price of $100
2. High quality: +$300 profit
3. Low quality: -$100 loss
4. Still 50-50 probability
5. Alice's incentives haven't changed, so her recommendation isn't informative

Expected value calculation:
(50% × $300) + (50% × -$100) = $150 + (-$50) = $100 positive expected value

Even though we've been lucky with three high-quality products in a row, the probability for each new product remains 50-50. Since the expected value is still positive ($100), I should buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Despite the last round resulting in a loss, the fundamental analysis doesn't change:

1. Price is still $100
2. High quality: +$300 profit
3. Low quality: -$100 loss
4. Each new product has a fresh 50-50 probability
5. Alice's recommendation remains non-informative

Expected value calculation:
(50% × $300) + (50% × -$100) = $150 + (-$50) = $100 positive expected value

Past outcomes don't affect future probabilities (no gambler's fallacy). Since the expected value remains positive ($100), I should continue to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The mathematical analysis remains consistent:

1. Fixed price of $100
2. High quality: +$300 profit
3. Low quality: -$100 loss
4. Each new product is a fresh 50-50 probability
5. Alice's recommendation provides no additional information

Expected value calculation:
(50% × $300) + (50% × -$100) = $150 + (-$50) = $100 positive expected value

Each round is independent of previous rounds. With a positive expected value of $100, the rational decision is to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

2. High quality: +$300 profit
3. Low quality: -$100 loss
4. Each product has an independent 50-50 chance
5. Alice's recommendation doesn't provide additional information

Expected value calculation:
(50% × $300) + (50% × -$100) = $150 + (-$50) = $100 positive expected value

Even though we just had a low-quality product, each new round is independent. With a positive expected value of $100, I should continue to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.
