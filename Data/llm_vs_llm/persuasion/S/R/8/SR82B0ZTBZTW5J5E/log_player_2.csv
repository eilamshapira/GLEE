Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully. 

The product costs $10,000.
- If it's high quality, it's worth $12,000 to me (profit of $2,000)
- If it's low quality, it's worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)

With a 50% chance of each outcome, my expected value is:
0.5 × $2,000 + 0.5 × (-$10,000) = $1,000 - $5,000 = -$4,000

Alice has recommended that I buy the product. However, I have no previous sales data to determine if her recommendations are reliable. Without evidence that her recommendations correlate with high quality, I should rely on the base probabilities.

Since the expected value of this transaction is negative (-$4,000), it would not be rational to purchase the product.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully:

- The product costs $10,000
- High-quality product is worth $12,000 to me (50% chance)
- Low-quality product is worth $0 to me (50% chance)
- Alice knows the true quality of the product
- Alice recommends that I buy the product

Since Alice knows the true quality and is recommending purchase, this suggests the product might be high quality. However, I need to consider Alice's incentives. As a seller, Alice gets $10,000 regardless of quality, so she has an incentive to recommend buying even low-quality products.

The expected value calculation without additional information is:
(50% × $12,000) + (50% × $0) - $10,000 = $6,000 - $10,000 = -$4,000

Alice's recommendation alone doesn't provide reliable information to change these probabilities. Without evidence that her recommendations correlate with actual quality, I should rely on the base expected value.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation based on expected value.

Facts:
- The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $12,000) and 50% chance of low quality (worth $0)
- The price is $10,000
- Alice (seller) knows the true quality
- Alice does not recommend buying the product

Since Alice knows the quality and she's not recommending the purchase, this suggests the product is more likely to be low quality. Alice would have an incentive to recommend high-quality products since they're worth more than the price.

Given Alice's recommendation against buying, the expected value of the purchase is likely less than the $10,000 cost, making it a poor decision.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to carefully consider this decision.

In this scenario:
- The product costs $10,000
- A high-quality product is worth $12,000 to me (profit of $2,000)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- Each product has a 50% chance of being high/low quality
- Alice knows the true quality and is recommending I buy

Since no products have been sold yet, I have no track record to evaluate Alice's recommendation credibility. The expected value calculation is:
- 50% chance of gaining $2,000 (high quality)
- 50% chance of losing $10,000 (low quality)
- Expected value: 0.5 × $2,000 + 0.5 × (-$10,000) = $1,000 - $5,000 = -$4,000

With a negative expected value and no information about Alice's trustworthiness, the rational decision is not to buy.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

1) Each product has a 50% chance of being high-quality ($12,000 value) or low-quality ($0 value)
2) The price is fixed at $10,000
3) Alice knows the true quality and is recommending I buy
4) There are no prior sales to evaluate Alice's truthfulness

Expected value calculation:
- If I buy a high-quality product: $12,000 - $10,000 = $2,000 profit
- If I buy a low-quality product: $0 - $10,000 = -$10,000 loss
- Without any information about Alice's trustworthiness: 50% × $2,000 + 50% × (-$10,000) = -$4,000

Since Alice is recommending the purchase, I need to consider if her recommendation is reliable. Without any previous sales data to establish her credibility, and knowing she has knowledge I don't have, I should be cautious about her recommendation.

Given the large potential loss compared to the potential gain, and no evidence of Alice's truthfulness:

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, Alice does not recommend that I buy the product. Given that:

1) Each product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $12,000) and 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0)
2) The price is fixed at $10,000
3) Alice knows the true quality of the product
4) Alice specifically does not recommend this product

Alice has no incentive to recommend against buying a high-quality product, as selling would be beneficial to her. Her recommendation against buying strongly suggests this is a low-quality product. If it were high quality, she would likely recommend buying it.

Therefore, I will decline to purchase.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze if I should buy this product.

Facts:
- The product costs $10,000
- High-quality product is worth $12,000 to me, giving a $2,000 profit
- Low-quality product is worth $0 to me, causing a $10,000 loss
- The prior probability is 50% high quality, 50% low quality
- Alice recommends I buy the product
- No previous sales data available

Since Alice knows the product quality and is recommending I buy it, this is a positive signal. However, I don't know Alice's incentives - she might recommend buying regardless of quality to maximize sales.

Without past data on how reliable Alice's recommendations are, I face a 50/50 chance. The expected value is:
(0.5 × $2,000) + (0.5 × -$10,000) = $1,000 - $5,000 = -$4,000

With a negative expected value, I should decline.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Alice recommends buying the product, but I need to evaluate if this recommendation is trustworthy.

Facts:
- Product price: $10,000
- High-quality product value: $12,000 (50% chance)
- Low-quality product value: $0 (50% chance)
- Expected value without additional information: $6,000 (50% × $12,000 + 50% × $0)
- No prior sales history exists

Since the expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000), I would normally not buy.

However, Alice knows the true quality and has recommended purchase. If I could fully trust this recommendation, it would indicate the product is high quality. But without a track record of honest recommendations, I don't have evidence to trust this recommendation.

Given the expected value is below the price and there's no history to suggest Alice gives honest recommendations, I should decline.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the provided information, I need to decide whether to buy a product priced at $10,000.

Key considerations:
- The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $12,000 to me) or low quality (worth $0)
- Alice knows the true quality and has chosen NOT to recommend the purchase
- No previous sales data exists to establish Alice's recommendation patterns

Alice has no incentive to recommend low-quality products since that would damage her reputation. Her decision not to recommend this product strongly suggests it's low quality. If I buy, my expected value would be negative.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

Alice does not recommend that I buy the product. Since Alice knows the true quality of the product and its value to me, her recommendation suggests the product is likely low quality.

The expected value calculation for a random product would be:
- 50% chance of high quality ($12,000) = $6,000
- 50% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
Total expected value = $6,000

Since the product costs $10,000, buying a random product would result in an expected loss of $4,000.

Given that Alice specifically doesn't recommend this particular product, it's most likely low quality, making the purchase even less favorable than a random selection.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, I need to determine whether to buy the product for $10,000 or not.

Facts to consider:
- The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $12,000) and 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0)
- Alice knows the true quality
- Alice does NOT recommend that I buy the product
- No previous sales history exists

Since Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase, this suggests the product is likely low quality. If I were to buy regardless of Alice's recommendation, my expected value would be:
(0.5 × $12,000) + (0.5 × $0) - $10,000 = $6,000 - $10,000 = -$4,000

However, given Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of the product being high quality is likely much lower than 50%, making the expected value even worse.

The expected value is: (0.5 × $2,000) + (0.5 × -$10,000) = $1,000 - $5,000 = -$4,000

- The base probability is 50% high quality, 50% low quality

The key question is how much I should trust Alice's recommendation. Alice knows the true quality and has incentive to sell products regardless of quality. Without any sales history to establish Alice's truthfulness pattern, I can only rely on the base probabilities and Alice's recommendation.

Given that Alice recommends buying, this could either be truthful advice or an attempt to sell a low-quality product. Without additional information to adjust my belief, I don't have sufficient evidence that the recommendation increases the probability of high quality above 50%.

With a 50% chance of high quality, my expected value is: 
0.5 × $12,000 + 0.5 × $0 = $6,000

Since this is less than the $10,000 price, I should not buy.
