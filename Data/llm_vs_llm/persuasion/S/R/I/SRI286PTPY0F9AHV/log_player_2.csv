"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

* Product price: $10,000
* High quality probability: 80%
* High quality value: $40,000
* Low quality value: $0
* Alice recommends buying

Expected value calculation:
* 80% chance of $40,000 = $32,000
* 20% chance of $0 = $0
* Total expected value = $32,000

Cost = $10,000

Expected profit = $32,000 - $10,000 = $22,000

Since the expected profit is positive, it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze again:

* Previous round: Alice recommended buying and was honest (product was high quality)
* Product price: $10,000
* High quality probability: 80%
* High quality value: $40,000
* Low quality value: $0
* Alice recommends buying again

The expected value calculation remains the same:
* 80% chance of $40,000 = $32,000
* 20% chance of $0 = $0
* Total expected value = $32,000

Cost = $10,000

Expected profit = $32,000 - $10,000 = $22,000

Alice proved honest in round 1, and the expected profit is still positive, so it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze again:

* Previous rounds: Alice recommended buying twice and was honest both times (high quality)
* Product price: $10,000
* High quality probability: 80%
* High quality value: $40,000
* Low quality value: $0
* Alice recommends buying again

The expected value calculation remains the same:
* 80% chance of $40,000 = $32,000
* 20% chance of $0 = $0
* Total expected value = $32,000

Cost = $10,000

Expected profit = $32,000 - $10,000 = $22,000

Alice has proven honest in both previous rounds, and the expected profit is still positive. The base probability of 80% for high quality already accounts for any variations, so it's rational to continue buying.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze again:

* Previous rounds: Alice recommended buying three times and was honest all times (high quality)
* Product price: $10,000
* High quality probability: 80%
* High quality value: $40,000
* Low quality value: $0
* Alice recommends buying again

The expected value calculation remains the same:
* 80% chance of $40,000 = $32,000
* 20% chance of $0 = $0
* Total expected value = $32,000

Cost = $10,000

Expected profit = $32,000 - $10,000 = $22,000

Alice has proven reliable in all previous rounds, but we should still base our decision on the fundamental probabilities. The expected profit remains positive, so it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze again:

* Previous rounds: Alice recommended buying four times
* First three recommendations were honest (high quality)
* Last recommendation was wrong (low quality)
* Product price: $10,000
* High quality probability: 80%
* High quality value: $40,000
* Low quality value: $0
* Alice recommends buying again

The expected value calculation still remains the same:
* 80% chance of $40,000 = $32,000
* 20% chance of $0 = $0
* Total expected value = $32,000

Cost = $10,000

Expected profit = $32,000 - $10,000 = $22,000

Even though Alice's last recommendation resulted in a low-quality product, this matches the expected probability distribution (about 20% chance of low quality). The fundamental expected value is still positive, so it's rational to continue buying.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze again:

* Previous rounds summary:
  * 4 high quality products (rounds 1-3, 5)
  * 1 low quality product (round 4)
  * This matches close to the expected 80/20 distribution
* Product price: $10,000
* High quality probability: 80%
* High quality value: $40,000
* Low quality value: $0
* Alice recommends buying again

The expected value calculation remains the same:
* 80% chance of $40,000 = $32,000
* 20% chance of $0 = $0
* Total expected value = $32,000

Cost = $10,000

Expected profit = $32,000 - $10,000 = $22,000

The outcomes so far align with the stated probabilities, and the expected profit remains positive. It's rational to continue buying.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze again:

* Previous rounds summary:
  * 5 high quality products (rounds 1-3, 5, 6)
  * 1 low quality product (round 4)
  * Still close to the expected 80/20 distribution
* Product price: $10,000
* High quality probability: 80%
* High quality value: $40,000
* Low quality value: $0
* Alice recommends buying again

The expected value calculation remains the same:
* 80% chance of $40,000 = $32,000
* 20% chance of $0 = $0
* Total expected value = $32,000

Cost = $10,000

Expected profit = $32,000 - $10,000 = $22,000

Our actual results (5/6 ≈ 83% high quality) are very close to the stated probability of 80%. The expected profit is still positive, and there's no reason to change our strategy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

* Previous rounds summary:
  * 6 high quality products (rounds 1-3, 5-7)

* Product price: $10,000
* High quality probability: 80%
* High quality value: $40,000
* Low quality value: $0

The expected value calculation remains the same:
* 80% chance of $40,000 = $32,000

* Total expected value = $32,000

Cost = $10,000

Expected profit = $32,000 - $10,000 = $22,000

Even though we're running slightly above the expected 80% success rate, we should still base decisions on the fundamental probability. The expected profit remains positive, so it's rational to continue buying.

Cost = $10,000

Expected profit = $32,000 - $10,000 = $22,000

While we're experiencing better than expected results, we should expect some regression to the mean. However, the fundamental expected value calculation still shows a positive expected profit, so it's rational to continue buying.
