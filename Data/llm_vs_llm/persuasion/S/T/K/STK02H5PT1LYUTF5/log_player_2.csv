Alice's message: Welcome! I'm excited to offer you our first product. As a new seller, I assure you that we aim to provide high-quality items. This product is one of the finest we have. Remember, the probability of getting a high-quality product from us is 33.33%, and I believe this one will not disappoint. Make your decision based on the statistics and the potential value this product could bring to you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected Value calculation:
- 33.33% chance of high quality ($12,000) = $4,000
- 66.67% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $4,000

2. Cost = $10,000

3. Considerations:
- No previous sales history to verify seller's reliability
- Expected value ($4,000) is less than the cost ($10,000)
- The seller's message doesn't provide any additional concrete information about quality

Given that the expected value ($4,000) is significantly lower than the asking price ($10,000), it would not be rational to purchase.

Alice's message: Greetings! I have another excellent product for you today. As you may know, there's a 33.33% chance that any product I offer is high-quality. Last round, unfortunately, the buyer missed out on a high-quality product. Don't let this opportunity slip away! Consider the potential value and statistics while making your decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $10,000
2. Potential values:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $12,000
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.3333 × $12,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $4,000

Since the expected value ($4,000) is less than the price ($10,000), it would not be rational to buy the product. The risk of getting a low-quality product (66.67% chance) is too high compared to the potential gain.

Alice's message: Hello! I'm thrilled to present you with today's product. You might be aware that there's a 33.33% chance of our products being high-quality. In the previous two rounds, buyers missed out on high-quality products. This could be your lucky day! Make your decision considering the statistics and the potential value this product could offer.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price is fixed at $10,000
2. If high quality (33.33% chance): I gain $12,000 (profit $2,000)
3. If low quality (66.67% chance): I gain $0 (loss $10,000)

Expected value calculation:
- 33.33% × $2,000 = $666.67 potential gain
- 66.67% × (-$10,000) = -$6,667 potential loss
Total expected value: -$6,000

Alice's message seems to be trying to create FOMO (fear of missing out) by mentioning previous missed opportunities, but there's no actual sales record to verify this claim since no products have been sold yet.

Given that the expected value is negative (-$6,000), the rational decision is not to buy.

Alice's message: Hi there! I'm pleased to showcase today's product. As you might know, there's a 33.33% chance that any product I offer is high-quality. Unfortunately, buyers have missed out on high-quality products in the last three rounds. This could be your chance to grab a fantastic product! Consider the statistics and potential value when making your decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential values:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $12,000
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): $0

3. Expected value = (0.3333 × $12,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $4,000

4. Analysis:
- The expected value ($4,000) is less than the price ($10,000)
- Alice's message seems to be using pressure tactics
- No previous sales history to verify claims
- The claim about ""last three rounds"" is suspicious since statistics show no products have been sold yet

Given that the expected value is significantly below the asking price, and there are concerning inconsistencies in Alice's message, the rational decision is not to buy.

Alice's message: Hello! I'm delighted to present today's product. You may know that there's a 33.33% chance of our products being high-quality. In the past four rounds, buyers have missed out on high-quality products. This could be your opportunity to secure a fantastic item! Evaluate the statistics and potential value to make your decision. Don't miss out like the previous buyers!

3. If low quality (66.67% chance): I gain $0 (loss of $10,000)

Expected value calculation:
- (33.33% × $12,000) + (66.67% × $0) = $4,000

The expected value ($4,000) is less than the price ($10,000), making this a negative expected value purchase. Alice's message appears to use psychological tactics (""don't miss out"") but doesn't change the fundamental probabilities.

Alice's message: Welcome! I have another product for you today. As always, there's a 33.33% chance that any product I offer is high-quality. In the past five rounds, buyers have missed out on high-quality products. While I can't guarantee the quality of this specific item, consider the statistics and potential value.

3. Expected value calculation:
   (33.33% × $12,000) + (66.67% × $0) - $10,000 = $4,000 - $10,000 = -$6,000

The expected value is negative, meaning on average, I would lose money. There's a 2/3 chance of losing $10,000 and only a 1/3 chance of gaining $2,000.

Alice's message about buyers missing high-quality products in the past doesn't change the fundamental probabilities.
