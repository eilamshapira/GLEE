Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - 50% chance of $1,200,000 (profit of $200,000)
   - 50% chance of $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
3. Expected value: (0.5 × $1,200,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $600,000

The expected value ($600,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), making this a negative expected value proposition, even with Alice's recommendation. Without any track record to establish trust in Alice's recommendations, it would be risky to rely solely on her advice.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. The product costs $1,000,000
2. If it's high quality, I gain $1,200,000 (profit of $200,000)
3. If it's low quality, I gain $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
4. Alice doesn't recommend buying it
5. There's no prior sales data to reference

Given that Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase, it's likely that this is a low-quality product. If I buy it, I would probably lose my entire investment of $1,000,000.

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50% chance): $1,200,000
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $1,200,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $600,000
4. Alice recommends buying, but since there's no track record yet, we can't verify her credibility
5. Risk vs Reward:
   - Best case: Profit of $200,000
   - Worst case: Loss of $1,000,000
   - Expected value ($600,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000)

Given that the expected value is significantly lower than the asking price, and there's no historical data to trust Alice's recommendation, it would be too risky to buy.

2. Potential value:

4. Considerations:
   - No previous sales history to base decision on
   - Seller's recommendation, but there's no track record to assess reliability
   - Expected value ($600,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000)

Since the expected value ($600,000) is significantly lower than the asking price ($1,000,000), even with the seller's recommendation, it would not be rational to buy.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Value if high quality: $1,200,000 (profit of $200,000)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
4. Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
5. Alice recommends buying

Since there's no previous sales history, I can only rely on the base probabilities and Alice's recommendation. However, Alice's incentive is to sell regardless of quality, so her recommendation might not be reliable.

Expected value calculation:
* 50% chance of $200,000 profit = $100,000
* 50% chance of $1,000,000 loss = -$500,000
* Net expected value = -$400,000

Since the expected value is negative, it would not be rational to buy.
