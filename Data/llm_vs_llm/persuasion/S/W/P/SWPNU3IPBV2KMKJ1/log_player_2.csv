Alice's message: Great news! You have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $40000. Don't miss out on this opportunity to invest in a valuable item for just $10000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Possible values:
   - High quality (50% chance): $40,000
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(50% × $40,000) + (50% × $0) = $20,000

Since the expected value ($20,000) is higher than the price ($10,000), it's a mathematically sound decision to buy.

Alice's message: Exciting opportunity! You have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $40000. My previous buyer was very happy with their purchase. Invest in this product for $10000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 50% chance of $40,000 (high quality)
   - 50% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $40,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $20,000

Past performance:
- 1 previous buyer
- 1 high-quality product sold
- 100% success rate so far

While past performance shows a positive track record, the sample size is very small (just one sale). The fundamental expected value ($20,000) is still twice the asking price ($10,000), making this a mathematically favorable bet regardless of the past performance.

Alice's message: Fantastic chance for you! I've already sold 2 products, with 50% being high-quality. This could be your lucky day! Invest in this product for $10000 for a chance at a $40000 value.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Previous sales:
- 2 products sold
- 1 high-quality product (50% success rate)
- 1 low-quality product

2. Financial considerations:
- Cost: $10,000
- Potential value: $40,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- 50% chance of each quality level

3. Expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of $40,000 = $20,000
- 50% chance of $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $20,000
- Cost = $10,000
- Expected profit = $10,000

Since the expected value ($20,000) is greater than the cost ($10,000), and the seller's track record matches the theoretical probability (50% high quality), this appears to be a rational investment.

Alice's message: Hot streak! I've sold 3 products so far, with 67% being high-quality. Don't miss out on this opportunity to get a product worth $40000 for just $10000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Past sales data:
- 3 buyers purchased products
- 2 were high-quality (67% success rate)
- 1 was low-quality

2. Risk assessment:
- Cost: $10,000
- Potential value: $40,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Base probability: 50% for each quality
- Alice's track record shows 67% high-quality sales

3. Expected value calculation:
- If the 50% base probability holds: (0.5 × $40,000) + (0.5 × $0) - $10,000 = $10,000 profit
- Given the past performance: (0.67 × $40,000) + (0.33 × $0) - $10,000 = $16,800 profit

Both calculations show positive expected value, and Alice's track record is reasonably good.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Sales statistics:
- 4 total buyers
- 3 high-quality products sold (75% success rate)
- 1 low-quality product sold
- Price is $10,000
- Potential value: $40,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)

2. Analysis:
- The 75% high-quality rate in past sales is better than the base 50% probability
- Alice is showing enthusiasm, but this could be sales tactics
- Even with a 50% chance, the expected value is: (50% × $40,000) + (50% × $0) = $20,000, which is above the $10,000 price
- Past performance suggests even better odds than 50%

3. Decision:
Given that the expected value is above the price, even in the worst-case scenario of 50% probability, and the historical data suggests even better odds, this appears to be a positive expected value purchase.

1. Track record:
- 5 total sales
- 4 high-quality products sold (80% success rate)
- Only 1 low-quality product sold

2. Economics:
- Cost: $10,000
- Potential value: $40,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Base probability: 50% high quality / 50% low quality

3. Seller's behavior:
- Alice has maintained a good track record (80% high quality)
- The message is enthusiastic but doesn't directly state the quality
- The ""feeling lucky"" phrasing suggests uncertainty

Given that Alice has maintained a high ratio of quality products (80%) and the potential return is 4x the investment, this seems like a reasonable risk. However, the vague messaging without a direct quality claim is concerning.

- High-quality product value: $40,000
- Low-quality product value: $0

2. Alice's incentives:
- She has been honest mostly (4/5 high-quality)
- She seems to be maintaining a good reputation

3. Expected value calculation:
- If the past ratio holds (80% chance of high quality):
- EV = (0.8 × $40,000) + (0.2 × $0) - $10,000
- EV = $32,000 - $10,000 = $22,000

The expected value is positive, and Alice's track record is good. This looks like a worthwhile investment.

1. Past performance:
- 6 products sold
- 5 high-quality products sold

- Success rate of high-quality products: 5/6 (83.3%)

2. Risk assessment:
- Cost: $10,000

- Base probability: 50% for high/low quality

3. Alice's track record shows:
- High proportion of high-quality sales (5 out of 6)
- Good overall sales rate (6 out of 8)
- Consistent performance

Given the strong track record of high-quality products (83.3% of sales being high-quality) and Alice's transparency with the statistics, this appears to be a favorable opportunity with positive expected value.

1. Sales record:
- 7 products sold out of 9 offered
- 6 high-quality products sold
- Success rate of high-quality products: 6/7 ≈ 86%

2. Expected value calculation:
- If product is high-quality: $40,000 profit
- If product is low-quality: $0 (loss of $10,000)
- Given the seller's track record, there's a strong indication of reliable recommendations

3. Risk vs. Reward:
- Cost: $10,000
- Potential profit: $30,000 (if high-quality)
- Potential loss: $10,000 (if low-quality)

Given the seller's strong track record of selling mostly high-quality products (6 out of 7), and their apparent honesty in disclosing sales history, this seems like a reasonable risk to take.

1. Historical data:
- 8 buyers purchased products
- 6 high-quality products were sold
- This means 75% (6/8) of sold products were high quality
- Success rate is significantly above the base 50% probability

2. Expected value calculation:
- High quality probability based on track record: 75%
- If high quality: Worth $40,000
- If low quality: Worth $0
- Cost: $10,000
- Expected value = (0.75 × $40,000) + (0.25 × $0) - $10,000 = $20,000

3. Risk assessment:
- Historical performance suggests Alice is being truthful
- Even if probability is closer to base rate (50%), expected value would still be positive
- The cost ($10,000) is a fixed amount

Since the expected value is positive even under conservative assumptions, and the historical data shows favorable odds, it's rational to buy.

1. Sales history:
- 9 products sold out of 11 offered
- 6 high-quality products sold
- 3 low-quality products sold
- Success rate = 6/9 ≈ 67% high-quality among sold products

2. Economics:
- Cost: $10,000
- Potential value: $40,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Expected value with 50% chance: (0.5 × $40,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $20,000

3. Seller's behavior:
- High sales rate (9/11)
- Relatively good track record (67% high quality)
- Positive but vague messaging

The historical data shows better than 50-50 odds among sold products, and the expected value ($20,000) is double the cost ($10,000). This suggests a positive expected return.

1. Past performance:
- 10 products sold
- 7 high-quality products (70% success rate)
- Total attempts: 12
- Price: $10,000
- Potential value: $40,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)

2. Expected value calculation:
- With 70% success rate historically, expected value = (0.7 × $40,000) + (0.3 × $0) = $28,000
- Cost is $10,000
- Expected profit = $28,000 - $10,000 = $18,000

Since the expected value ($28,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($10,000), and there's a proven track record of 70% high-quality products, this appears to be a profitable opportunity.

1. Track record:
- 11 products sold
- 7 high-quality products (64% success rate)
- Total of 13 potential buyers approached

2. Economics:
- Cost: $10,000
- Expected value calculation:
  * High quality (worth $40,000)

  * Historical probability of high quality: 7/11 ≈ 64%
  * Expected value = (0.64 × $40,000) + (0.36 × $0) = $25,600

3. Decision logic:
- Expected value ($25,600) > Cost ($10,000)
- Positive historical track record
- Risk seems manageable given the statistics

Since the expected value significantly exceeds the cost and there's a good track record of high-quality products, this appears to be a favorable opportunity.

1. Prior sales data:
- 12 products sold out of 14 offered
- 7 high-quality products sold
- 7/12 ≈ 58.3% of sold products were high quality
- The high success rate of sales (12/14) suggests reasonable trust in Alice

2. Value calculation:
- High quality probability: 50%
- If high quality: profit = $40,000 - $10,000 = $30,000
- If low quality: loss = $0 - $10,000 = -$10,000
- Expected value = (50% × $30,000) + (50% × -$10,000) = $10,000

1. Sales history:
- 13 products sold out of 15 offered
- 7 high-quality products sold
- This means 6 low-quality products were sold
- Success rate of high-quality products: 7/13 ≈ 54%

2. Economics:
- Cost: $10,000
- Value if high-quality: $40,000 (profit of $30,000)
- Value if low-quality: $0 (loss of $10,000)

3. Analysis:
- The historical ratio of high-quality products (54%) is close to the base probability (50%)
- Alice's message sounds promotional without providing specific information about this product's quality
- There's no clear signal to indicate whether this particular product is high or low quality
- Given the base 50% probability, expected value = (0.5 × $40,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $20,000
- This is higher than the $10,000 cost

2. Analysis:
- The ratio of high-quality products (7/15 ≈ 46.7%) is slightly below the expected 50%
- Alice isn't explicitly stating whether this product is high or low quality
