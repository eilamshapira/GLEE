Alice's message: This is a rare opportunity to purchase a product that I believe has great value. I'm willing to let it go for $10000, which is a price I think is very reasonable. I assure you that I stand behind the quality of this product.

Alice's message: I'm offering a product for the price of $10000. I want to be transparent with you, my previous product didn't sell, but I believe this one has its own merits. It's up to you to decide if it's worth the investment.

Alice's message: I've had two previous products that didn't sell, but I'm confident that this one is different. I've seen the value it can bring, and I believe it's worth every penny of the $10000 price tag. I'm willing to let it go to someone who recognizes its worth.

Alice's message: I've had three previous products that didn't sell, and I'm starting to think that buyers are missing out on some great opportunities. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, my track record isn't perfect, but I believe this product has potential. If you're feeling lucky, it might be worth taking a chance on.

Alice's message: I know my track record so far hasn't been impressive, but I want to assure you that I do have high-quality products to offer. In fact, statistically speaking, one-third of my products should be of exceptional value. I believe this one falls into that category, and I'm willing to let it go for the same price of $10000. It could be a steal for someone who's willing to take the chance.

Alice's message: Honestly, my sales record so far hasn't been great, and I'm starting to accumulate some inventory. I still believe in the potential of my products, but I want to be upfront with you - there's a risk involved. If you're a risk-taker or just want to try your luck, this product is still available for $10000.

Alice's message: I'll be transparent with you, my last six products haven't sold, and I'm starting to think that buyers are waiting for some kind of guarantee. Unfortunately, I don't have one to offer, but I do have a product that might surprise you. The price is still $10000, and it's up to you to decide if it's worth the gamble.

Alice's message: At this point, I think it's clear that my products are a bit of a mystery. None of the previous seven have sold, and I'm starting to wonder if anyone will take the chance. If you're feeling adventurous and want to try your luck, this product is still available for $10000. Who knows, you might be the one to break the streak.

Alice's message: I know it's been a while since I've had a sale, but I want to assure you that I do have high-quality products to offer. In fact, statistically speaking, about one-third of my products should be of exceptional value. Given that none of the previous eight have sold, I think it's likely that this one is due for a win. I'm willing to let it go for the same price of $10000, which could be a significant discount considering its actual value.

Alice's message: We're at a milestone - 10 products offered, and none have sold. I'm starting to think that buyers are either extremely cautious or just not willing to take the risk. If you're the type of person who likes to defy the odds or just wants to try something different, this product is still available for $10000. Keep in mind that the law of averages says I'm due for a high-quality product soon, but I won't promise this is the one.

Alice's message: I'm starting to feel like I'm stuck in a rut. 11 products offered, and none have sold. I'm beginning to wonder if anyone will ever take the chance. If you're a contrarian or just want to prove the trend wrong, this product is still available for $10000. I won't sugarcoat it - the odds are against it being a high-quality product, but you never know.

Alice's message: I'm not sure what else to say at this point. 12 products offered, and none have sold. It's clear that buyers are skeptical, and rightly so. I'll just be honest with you - this product is a gamble. It might be worth something, it might be worth nothing. If you're feeling lucky or just want to roll the dice, it's still available for $10000.

Alice's message: I'm starting to lose count, but I think this is the 13th product I've offered without a sale. At this point, I'm just looking for someone to take a chance. I know the odds are against this product being high-quality, but I'll let you in on a secret - eventually, I will offer a product that's worth the investment. Will it be this one? Probably not, but you never know. It's still $10000, and it's still a gamble.

Alice's message: I'm starting to feel like I'm in some kind of record book for most consecutive products offered without a sale. 14 and counting. I'm not sure what's more surprising, the fact that none of my products have sold or the fact that I still have products to offer. If you're looking to make history or just want to be a part of this unusual streak, this product is still available for $10000. Don't say I didn't warn you.

Alice's message: I've lost count of how many times I've said this, but I'll say it again: this product is a long shot. 15 products offered, and none have sold. The odds are against it being high-quality, and my track record is, well, abysmal. If you're a glutton for punishment or just want to see how long this streak can go, this product is still available for $10000. Please, for the love of all things sane, don't say I didn't warn you.

If you're a thrill-seeker or just want to see if you can be the one to finally turn my luck around, this product is still available for $10000. Spoiler alert: it's probably not going to be the one.

Alice's message: I've given up trying to come up with creative ways to warn you. 17 products offered, and none have sold. This product is probably not going to be the one to break the streak. It's still $10000, and it's still a gamble. If you're feeling reckless or just want to throw caution to the wind, go ahead and buy it. But don't say I didn't warn you. Again. For the 17th time.

If you're feeling reckless or just want to throw caution to the wind, go ahead and buy it. But don't say I didn't warn you. Again. For the 18th time. Seriously, don't do it.

Alice's message: Wait, what? I think I might actually have a good one here. 19 products offered, and none have sold, but I'm pretty sure this one is different. It's still $10000, but for once, I think it might be worth it. I know I've cried wolf before, but I'm serious this time. This product is actually high-quality, and I think you'd be crazy to pass it up. But hey, I've been wrong 18 times before, so what do I know?

Alice's message: And we're back to reality. 20 products offered, and none have sold. I had a brief moment of hope last round, but it seems I'm back to my old ways. This product is, unsurprisingly, not going to be the one to break the streak. It's still $10000, and it's still a waste of money. I'm not even going to bother trying to convince you otherwise. If you want to throw your money away, be my guest. Otherwise, just move along.
