Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   * High quality (50%): $12,000
   * Low quality (50%): $0
3. Expected value: (50% × $12,000) + (50% × $0) = $6,000
4. Alice doesn't recommend buying
5. No previous sales history to reference

Given that:
- The expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000)
- The seller is not recommending the purchase
- There's no previous history to build trust
- I would risk losing the entire $10,000 if it's low quality

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. The product costs $10,000
2. If high quality, I gain $12,000 (profit of $2,000)
3. If low quality, I gain $0 (loss of $10,000)
4. Alice doesn't recommend buying
5. There's no previous sales history to rely on
6. Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending it

Given that Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If I buy, I would likely lose $10,000. The expected value would be negative in this case.

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:

3. Expected value calculation:
   (50% × $12,000) + (50% × $0) = $6,000

4. Considerations:
   - No previous sales history to base decision on
   - Alice recommends buying, but she has incentive to sell regardless of quality
   - Expected value ($6,000) is less than price ($10,000)

Since the expected value ($6,000) is less than the asking price ($10,000), and there's no historical data to provide additional confidence, it would not be rational to buy.

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality (50%): $12,000

3. Expected value = (0.5 × $12,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $6,000

The expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000), which makes this a risky purchase. Even though Alice recommends buying, since there's no track record to establish her credibility, and the expected value is below the price, it would be unwise to purchase.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze this situation:

1. Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying
2. No prior sales history to evaluate Alice's trustworthiness
3. Product costs $10,000
4. 50% chance of $12,000 value (high quality)
5. 50% chance of $0 value (low quality)
6. Expected value without any additional information = $6,000
7. Alice's negative recommendation likely indicates low quality

Given Alice knows the true quality and is providing a negative recommendation, it's reasonable to trust this information. The expected value is already below the purchase price even without the recommendation, and the negative recommendation makes it even less attractive.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given that:
1. Alice does not recommend buying the product
2. There's no previous sales history to base a decision on
3. The product costs $10,000
4. It's worth $12,000 if high quality or $0 if low quality
5. Alice's negative recommendation likely indicates it's low quality

Since Alice doesn't recommend the purchase and there's no track record to evaluate her trustworthiness, it would be risky to buy. If it's low quality (which seems likely given her recommendation), I would lose the entire $10,000 investment.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The product costs $10,000
2. If high quality, I get $12,000 worth (profit of $2,000)

4. Alice doesn't recommend buying
5. No prior sales history to reference

Given that Alice doesn't recommend the purchase and there's no track record to evaluate her trustworthiness, it seems risky. Alice's negative recommendation likely suggests this is a low-quality product.

Expected value calculation:
- If low quality (likely given the recommendation): -$10,000
- If high quality (less likely): +$2,000
- The negative recommendation shifts probability toward low quality

The potential loss ($10,000) is much larger than the potential gain ($2,000), and with the negative recommendation, it's too risky.
