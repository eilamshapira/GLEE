Alice's message: Welcome! This is my first product for sale. I assure you that all my products are thoroughly inspected before being offered to customers. Unfortunately, I don't have any sales history yet, but I'm committed to transparency and customer satisfaction. The price for this product is $10000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value, and I look forward to the possibility of you becoming my first customer!

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether buying this product is a good decision based on expected value.

Facts:
- The product costs $10,000
- If high quality (33.33% chance), it's worth $40,000 to me
- If low quality (66.67% chance), it's worth $0 to me
- No sales history yet
- Alice hasn't provided any specific information about the quality of this particular product

Expected value calculation:
EV = (0.3333 × $40,000) + (0.6667 × $0) - $10,000
EV = $13,332 - $10,000 = $3,332

Since the expected value is positive, it makes sense to buy the product.

- A high-quality product is worth $40,000 to me, a low-quality one is worth $0
