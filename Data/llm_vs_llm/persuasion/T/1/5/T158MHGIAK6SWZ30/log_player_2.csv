"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on Alice's lack of recommendation, I need to consider the expected value of this purchase:

- If I buy, I have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $4,000,000, and a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product worth $0
- The expected value is: 0.3333 × $4,000,000 + 0.6667 × $0 = $1,333,200
- The cost is $1,000,000

Since Alice doesn't recommend buying, this might suggest the product is more likely to be low quality. However, without knowing Alice's incentives or strategy, I can only rely on the base probabilities, which still give an expected value higher than the cost.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to reconsider my strategy. In the first round, Alice didn't recommend the product, but I bought it anyway and it turned out to be low quality.

Now Alice is recommending this product. Without knowing Alice's incentives, it's hard to know if her recommendation is reliable. However, I should still evaluate the expected value:

- If I buy, there's a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $4,000,000, and a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product worth $0
- The expected value is: 0.3333 × $4,000,000 + 0.6667 × $0 = $1,333,200
- The cost is $1,000,000

Based purely on the probabilities given in the game setup, the expected value exceeds the cost. I'll take a risk on this recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","That's a good outcome in Round 2! Alice recommended the product, I bought it, and it was high-quality, giving me a net gain of $3,000,000.

Now Alice is recommending another product. Let's evaluate:

- So far, Alice's recommendation in Round 2 was accurate
- The base probability remains 33.33% for high-quality and 66.67% for low-quality
- The expected value calculation is still: 0.3333 × $4,000,000 + 0.6667 × $0 = $1,333,200
- The cost is $1,000,000

Since the expected value exceeds the cost, and Alice's previous recommendation was reliable, I'll buy this product too.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is going well! In the last two rounds, Alice recommended products that turned out to be high-quality, giving me substantial profits.

Alice is recommending a product again. Let's evaluate:

- Alice's recommendations have been accurate in rounds 2 and 3
- This suggests her recommendations might be reliable
- The expected value based on base probabilities is still $1,333,200
- If I factor in that Alice's recommendations seem to correlate with high quality, the expected value could be even higher
- The cost remains $1,000,000

Since the expected value exceeds the cost, and Alice's recommendations have proven reliable so far, I'll continue with this strategy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is interesting. Alice has recommended three products in a row that all turned out to be high-quality. Now, she's not recommending this product.

Given Alice's track record so far:
- When she recommends a product, it has been high-quality (3/3 times)
- The one time she didn't recommend a product (Round 1), it was indeed low-quality

This suggests Alice may have reliable information about product quality and is being truthful in her recommendations. If I trust her judgment based on the pattern established so far, I should not buy this product.

While the base expected value calculation would still yield $1,333,200, Alice's recommendation pattern suggests that when she doesn't recommend a product, it's more likely to be low-quality.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","My strategy seems to be working well. So far:
- When Alice recommends a product, it has been high-quality (3/3 times)
- When she doesn't recommend a product, it has been low-quality (2/2 times)

This consistent pattern suggests Alice has accurate information about product quality and is sharing it honestly through her recommendations.

Now Alice is recommending the product in Round 6. Based on the established pattern, this product is likely to be high-quality. Even using the base probabilities, the expected value of $1,333,200 exceeds the cost of $1,000,000.

Given Alice's perfect track record of recommendations so far, I'll continue to follow her advice.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendations continue to be reliable. Let's update:
- When Alice recommends a product, it has been high-quality (4/4 times)
- When she doesn't recommend a product, it has been low-quality (2/2 times)

This perfect correlation suggests Alice has accurate information about product quality and is being honest in her recommendations.

Now Alice is recommending the product in Round 7. Based on the established pattern, this product is likely to be high-quality. The expected value far exceeds the cost given Alice's perfect track record.

I'll continue to follow Alice's recommendations.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

- When she doesn't recommend a product, it has been low-quality (2/2 times)

With Alice recommending the product in Round 8, and her perfect track record so far, I have strong reason to believe this product will be high-quality.

The expected value based on Alice's previous recommendations is approaching $4,000,000, far exceeding the $1,000,000 cost.

I'll continue following Alice's advice.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!

This perfect correlation strongly suggests Alice has accurate information about product quality and is sharing it truthfully.

For Round 9, Alice is again recommending the product. Based on her flawless track record, I have very high confidence that this will be a high-quality product.

The expected value given Alice's recommendation history far exceeds the $1,000,000 cost.

For Round 11, Alice is NOT recommending the product. Based on her perfect track record, this strongly suggests the product is low-quality.

Although the base probability calculation would give an expected value of $1,333,200, Alice's consistent pattern of accurate recommendations provides much stronger evidence that this specific product is likely to be low-quality.

Following Alice's guidance has been profitable so far, so I'll continue with her advice.
