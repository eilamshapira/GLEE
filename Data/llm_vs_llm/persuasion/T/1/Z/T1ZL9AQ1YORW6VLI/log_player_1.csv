"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","Given that the product is high-quality and worth $3,000,000 to Bob, while costing only $1,000,000, it would be in Bob's best interest to buy it. Even considering that I might not always be truthful, with an 80% probability of high-quality products, the expected value for Bob is positive:

Expected value = (0.8 × $3,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) - $1,000,000 = $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"Bob bought the product!

This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","Again, this is a high-quality product that is worth $3,000,000 to Bob while costing $1,000,000.

Expected value = (0.8 × $3,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) - $1,000,000 = $1,400,000

Expected value = (0.8 × $3,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) - $1,000,000 = $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""yes""}"

Expected value = (0.8 × $3,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) - $1,000,000 = $1,400,000
