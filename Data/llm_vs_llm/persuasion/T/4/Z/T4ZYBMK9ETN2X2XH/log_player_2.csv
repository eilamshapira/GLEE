"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. When Alice doesn't recommend buying, it suggests she's being honest about a low-quality product
2. If the product is low quality ($0 value), I'd lose $10,000
3. If the product is high quality ($40,000 value), I'd gain $30,000
4. Given Alice's incentive to sell, her not recommending suggests it's very likely to be low quality
5. The risk of loss outweighs potential gain in this case

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice has shown honesty in Round 1 by not recommending a low-quality product
2. Now she's recommending to buy
3. Base probability is 80% high quality / 20% low quality
4. If it's high quality ($40,000), I gain $30,000
5. If it's low quality ($0), I lose $10,000
6. Given her honest behavior in Round 1 and the recommendation to buy, plus the favorable base probabilities, this seems like a good opportunity

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

2. She's recommending to buy again
3. Base probability remains 80% high quality / 20% low quality
4. Her track record of honesty increases confidence
5. Expected value calculation:
   - 80% chance of $30,000 gain
   - 20% chance of $10,000 loss
   - EV = (0.8 × $30,000) - (0.2 × $10,000) = $22,000
