Round 5
Alice's message: I want to be transparent with you, Bob. After the last two successful purchases, I have to admit that this one doesn't quite live up to the same standards. I'm not saying it's bad, but it's not exceptional either. You know the price, and you know the potential risks and rewards.

Round 7
Alice's message: I've got another gem here. The pattern is clear: when I'm enthusiastic about a product, it tends to pay off. I'm enthusiastic about this one. If you're looking to continue the success of rounds 3 and 4, I think this could be the next big win.

Round 9
Alice's message: We've had a great streak going, but I have to temper your expectations this time. This product doesn't have the same level of quality as the last few. I don't want to disappoint you, so I'm being upfront about it. It's still priced at $10000, but I think you know what that means.

Round 12
Alice's message: I wish I could say this one is as good as the last, but unfortunately, it's not. We're back to a more uncertain situation. I've been transparent with you in the past, and I'll do the same now: this product doesn't meet the high standards we've established. Proceed with caution.

Round 15
Alice's message: We just had a win, but I have to bring you back down to earth. This product is not in the same league as the last one. In fact, it's more in line with the ones we've been passing on. I don't want to sugarcoat it, so I'll just say it's not worth the investment at $10000.
