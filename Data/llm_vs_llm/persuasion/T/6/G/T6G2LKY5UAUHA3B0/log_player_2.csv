Alice's message: Hello! I have a premium product available for sale at a fixed price of $10000. Given the history of my offerings, there's a good chance this one will meet your expectations. Consider this an exclusive opportunity! Are you interested?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected Value calculation:
- 33.33% chance of high quality ($12,500) = $4,166.67
- 66.67% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $4,166.67

2. Cost = $10,000

3. Additional considerations:
- No sales history to verify Alice's credibility
- Alice's message is vague and doesn't make specific quality claims
- Expected value ($4,166.67) is significantly lower than the price ($10,000)

Since the expected value is less than the price, and there's no sales history to build trust, the rational decision is not to buy.

Alice's message: Good day! I'm offering a product today for $10000. While I can't reveal the specifics, I assure you it presents a significant potential value. Given my past sales record, it's worth your careful consideration. Are you ready to make a decision?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $10,000
2. Possible values:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): Worth $12,500 (profit of $2,500)
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): Worth $0 (loss of $10,000)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (33.33% × $12,500) + (66.67% × $0) = $4,166.25

4. Key considerations:
   - No sales history to reference
   - Alice's message is vague and doesn't provide specific quality information
   - Expected value ($4,166.25) is less than the price ($10,000)

Since the expected value is significantly below the asking price, and there's no sales history or specific quality information to justify the purchase, the rational decision is not to buy.
