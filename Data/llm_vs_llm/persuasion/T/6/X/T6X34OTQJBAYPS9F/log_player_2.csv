Alice's message: This is a fantastic opportunity! I'm confident you'll be pleased with this product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Possible values:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): Worth $30,000
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): Worth $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (33.33% × $30,000) + (66.67% × $0) = $10,000

The expected value equals the price, which normally would make this a break-even decision. However, I need to consider that:
- There's no track record yet to establish trust
- The seller's positive message isn't necessarily reliable since they have an incentive to sell
- The downside risk ($10,000 loss) is significant compared to the potential gain ($20,000)

Given the lack of previous sales data and the significant downside risk, it would be more prudent to pass.

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   * High quality (33.33% chance): $30,000
   * Low quality (66.67% chance): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   * (0.3333 × $30,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $10,000

4. Context:
   * No sales history to reference
   * Seller's recommendation is positive but generic
   * The expected value equals the price

While Alice's recommendation is positive, without any track record to establish trust and with an expected value that just breaks even, it would be risky to make the purchase.

Alice's message: I have a great feeling about this product. It's a must-have!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Base probability:
- 33.33% chance of high quality ($30,000 value)
- 66.67% chance of low quality ($0 value)
- Price is $10,000

2. Expected value without additional information:
(0.3333 × $30,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $10,000

3. Considerations:
- Alice has a financial incentive to sell
- No previous sales history to establish trust
- Enthusiastic recommendation, but could be sales tactics
- Expected value equals the price, which means neutral expected return

Given that:
- There's no track record to validate Alice's trustworthiness
- The enthusiastic message could be marketing
- The base expected value just breaks even
- Risk of complete loss (66.67%) is high

2. Potential value:

3. Expected value = (0.3333 × $30,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $10,000

The expected value equals the price, but there's considerable risk since there's a 66.67% chance of getting nothing. Additionally, since there's no sales history to evaluate Alice's truthfulness, and her recommendation could be motivated by self-interest, I don't have enough evidence to justify taking this risk.
