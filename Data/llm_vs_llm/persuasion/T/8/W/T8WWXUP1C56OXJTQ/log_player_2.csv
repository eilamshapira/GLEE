Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The product costs $10,000
2. If high quality (33.33% chance), I gain $20,000 (profit of $10,000)
3. If low quality (66.67% chance), I gain $0 (loss of $10,000)
4. Alice doesn't recommend buying, which suggests it might be low quality
5. No previous sales history to provide additional information

Expected value without considering Alice's recommendation:
(0.3333 × $20,000) + (0.6667 × $0) - $10,000 = -$3,334

Given Alice's negative recommendation and the negative expected value, I should not buy.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $20,000
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): $0

3. Expected value without additional information:
   (0.3333 × $20,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $6,666

4. Additional information:
   - Alice does NOT recommend buying
   - As a seller, Alice benefits from selling, so a negative recommendation is likely honest
   - No previous sales data to reference

Given that Alice doesn't recommend the purchase and the expected value ($6,666) is already below the asking price ($10,000), this appears to be a risky purchase with negative expected returns.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think this through:

1. The product costs $10,000
2. If high quality (33.33% chance), I gain $20,000 (net profit $10,000)
3. If low quality (66.67% chance), I gain $0 (net loss $10,000)
4. Alice doesn't recommend buying
5. Since Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying, this likely signals it's low quality

Expected value without Alice's recommendation:
(0.3333 × $20,000) + (0.6667 × $0) - $10,000 = -$3,334

With Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of it being low quality is even higher, making the expected value even worse.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The base probability is:
- 33.33% chance of high quality ($20,000 value)
- 66.67% chance of low quality ($0 value)

2. Alice doesn't recommend buying, which suggests it might be low quality. 

3. The expected value calculation before Alice's recommendation:
- (0.3333 × $20,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $6,666

4. Given Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of it being low quality is likely even higher than 66.67%, making the expected value even lower.

5. Since the price is $10,000 and the expected value is less than that (and likely much less given the negative recommendation), it's not a good purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Price is $10,000
2. If high quality (33.33% chance), I get $20,000 value (+$10,000 profit)
3. If low quality (66.67% chance), I get $0 value (-$10,000 loss)
4. Alice doesn't recommend buying
5. No prior sales data to reference

Expected value calculation:
- 33.33% × $10,000 profit - 66.67% × $10,000 loss
- = $3,333 - $6,667
- = -$3,334 expected loss

Given that:
- The expected value is negative
- Alice (who knows the true quality) doesn't recommend buying
- There's no sales history to provide additional context

Since Alice doesn't recommend buying and she knows the true quality, this is likely a signal that the product is low quality. Given that the expected value ($6,666) is already below the asking price ($10,000), and with Alice's negative recommendation, buying would be too risky.
