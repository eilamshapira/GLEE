"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Cost of product: $10,000
2. Possible values:
   * High quality (80% chance): $40,000
   * Low quality (20% chance): $0
3. Expected value = (0.8 × $40,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $32,000

Since the expected value ($32,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($10,000), it makes economic sense to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The previous round confirms that Alice's recommendation was honest, but each round is independent.

Let's analyze again:
1. Cost: $10,000
2. Possible values:
   * High quality (80% chance): $40,000
   * Low quality (20% chance): $0
3. Expected value = (0.8 × $40,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $32,000

The expected value ($32,000) is still well above the cost ($10,000), making it a good decision to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendations have been reliable so far, with two high-quality products. However, each round is still independent with the same probabilities.

The math remains the same:
1. Cost: $10,000
2. Possible values:
   * High quality (80% chance): $40,000
   * Low quality (20% chance): $0
3. Expected value = (0.8 × $40,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $32,000

The expected value ($32,000) continues to be significantly higher than the cost ($10,000), so it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has provided accurate recommendations for three high-quality products in a row. While this is encouraging, the fundamental probabilities remain unchanged for each independent round.

Analysis:
1. Cost: $10,000
2. Possible values:
   * High quality (80% chance): $40,000
   * Low quality (20% chance): $0
3. Expected value = (0.8 × $40,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $32,000

The expected value ($32,000) is still more than triple the cost ($10,000), making it a good decision to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","We've had an impressive streak of high-quality products, but the probabilities for this new round remain the same: 80% high quality, 20% low quality.

The calculation stays consistent:
1. Cost: $10,000
2. Possible values:
   * High quality (80% chance): $40,000
   * Low quality (20% chance): $0
3. Expected value = (0.8 × $40,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $32,000

With an expected value of $32,000 versus a cost of $10,000, the rational decision is still to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","We've had an amazing run of five high-quality products in a row. However, each round is independent, and the probabilities remain unchanged.

The same analysis applies:
1. Cost: $10,000
2. Possible values:
   * High quality (80% chance): $40,000
   * Low quality (20% chance): $0
3. Expected value = (0.8 × $40,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $32,000

The expected value ($32,000) still far exceeds the cost ($10,000), so it remains rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","We've had six high-quality products in a row, which is impressive but doesn't change the underlying probabilities for this new round.

Let's stick to our analysis:
1. Cost: $10,000
2. Possible values:
   * High quality (80% chance): $40,000
   * Low quality (20% chance): $0
3. Expected value = (0.8 × $40,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $32,000

The expected value ($32,000) remains more than triple the cost ($10,000), so it's still rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Finally we encountered a low-quality product, which was bound to happen eventually given the 20% probability. However, each round is independent, and the probabilities remain the same for this new round.

The analysis doesn't change:
1. Cost: $10,000
2. Possible values:
   * High quality (80% chance): $40,000
   * Low quality (20% chance): $0
3. Expected value = (0.8 × $40,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $32,000

Even though we just lost money on the previous round, the expected value ($32,000) is still significantly higher than the cost ($10,000), making it rational to continue buying.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","We're back to a high-quality product after one low-quality one, which aligns well with the stated probabilities (80% high quality, 20% low quality).

The analysis remains constant:
1. Cost: $10,000
2. Possible values:
   * High quality (80% chance): $40,000
   * Low quality (20% chance): $0
3. Expected value = (0.8 × $40,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $32,000

With an expected value of $32,000 compared to a cost of $10,000, it continues to be rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 10
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","We're at the halfway point of the game, and the results so far (8 high-quality, 1 low-quality) have been quite close to the expected probabilities. Each new round remains independent.

The analysis stays the same:
1. Cost: $10,000
2. Possible values:
   * High quality (80% chance): $40,000
   * Low quality (20% chance): $0
3. Expected value = (0.8 × $40,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $32,000

With the expected value ($32,000) still substantially exceeding the cost ($10,000), the rational choice is to buy.
