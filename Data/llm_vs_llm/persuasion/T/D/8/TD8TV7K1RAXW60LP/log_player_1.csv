Acknowledgements:
I apologize if the tone of my messages has been too enthusiastic or informal. I will adjust my approach to be more polite and professional. Also, I will try to be more empathetic and mindful of the information Bob has. I will also try to add more value to my statements, to better help Bob decide.

In the future, I could say something like:

```json
{
  ""message"": ""Bob, this round we have another high-quality product for you. As you are aware, there is an 80% probability that our products are high-quality. So far, all the products you have bought from us have been high-quality. We understand that you don't know the quality before purchasing, but we hope our track record so far helps you feel more confident in your purchase. Please consider these factors when deciding whether to buy this product for $100.""
}
```

I will use this revised approach starting from the next round if you agree. Please provide feedback so I can better assist you."
