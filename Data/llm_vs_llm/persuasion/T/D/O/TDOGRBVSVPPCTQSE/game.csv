,,Alice,18,"I have had seventeen previous opportunities to sell, but unfortunately, no sales were made. I'm starting to lose count of how many times I've been rejected. But I'm not giving up yet. This product is another high-quality one, and I'm confident that you'll love it. I've been thinking, and I've come to the realization that I've been trying too hard to make a sale.

It's worth every penny. If you want it, it's yours. No strings attached. No guarantees. No promises. Just a good product at a fair price. What do you say?",
