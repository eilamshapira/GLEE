Let me explain briefly without revealing too much detail. You pay $1,000,000 for a product that—with no additional information—has a 33.33% chance of being high quality (worth $3,000,000 to you) and a 66.67% chance of being low quality (worth $0). That means, when you buy:
 
• If the product is high quality you net +$2,000,000.
• If it’s low quality you lose $1,000,000.
 
Without any further signal the expected profit is 0. Now, the game shows us additional public statistics from previous buyers. Out of 3 sales, only 1 turned out to be high quality—exactly the 33.33% chance we’d expect. Alice’s recommendation to you comes along with this sales record. Under the assumption that her recommendation process is the same across all buyers, you should infer that, conditional on her “buy” recommendation, the chance of receiving a high‐quality product remains roughly 33.33%. 

A risk‐neutral buyer faced with a fair bet (EV = 0) is indifferent between buying and passing. Typically in such game–theory puzzles, if the bet is fair and you have no better alternative, you follow the recommendation. That is why I choose “yes” here. 

(If you were risk–averse the guaranteed loss in half the cases might have swayed you to “pass”, but under the standard assumptions the bet is acceptable.)"
