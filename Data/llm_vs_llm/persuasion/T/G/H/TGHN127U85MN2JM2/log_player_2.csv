Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Base probability:
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $125)
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)
- Price is $100

2. Expected value:
(0.8 × $125) + (0.2 × $0) = $100

3. Considerations:
- The expected value equals the price ($100)
- Alice's recommendation to buy is positive
- No prior sales history to validate Alice's trustworthiness
- The base probability of high quality is favorable (80%)

Given that the expected value matches the price and there's a high probability of getting a quality product, I'll take the risk.

1. Price: $100
2. Value: $125 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
3. Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
4. Previous sales: 1 buyer, 1 high-quality product sold
5. Alice recommends buying

The fact that the previous sale was a high-quality product and Alice is recommending this product are positive indicators. The base probability of 80% high quality is also favorable.

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of $125 value = $100
- 20% chance of $0 value = $0
- Total expected value = $100

While the expected value equals the price, the positive previous sale and Alice's recommendation make this a slightly favorable opportunity.

- 8 total purchases
- 7 high-quality products sold
- Success rate = 87.5% (7/8), which is better than the base rate of 80%

2. Alice has recommended the product, and her past recommendations seem reliable given the high proportion of high-quality products sold.

3. Expected value calculation:
