Round 9
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Before we proceed, I need to clarify my strategy. The current strategy of always saying ""yes"" may not be optimal. Given that buyers know the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, they might start to distrust our recommendations if they encounter a low-quality product.

To build trust and potentially increase sales in the long run, we could consider being honest about the quality of the product. This way, buyers might be more likely to trust our recommendations and purchase the product when we say it's high-quality.

For this round, I recommend telling the buyer the truth.

```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

In addition, I would like to send a message to the buyer: ""This round's product is high-quality. You know that 80% of our products are high-quality. We sold 8 out of 8 (100%) so far. You can trust our recommendation."" Please relay this message to the buyer."

Additionally, I would like to conduct an experiment to better understand the buyers' valuations of high- and low-quality products. In the next round, if the product is low-quality, I recommend telling the buyer the truth and saying that the product is low-quality. Please relay this message to the buyer."

Given that all products so far have been high-quality, buyers might start to expect that all products are high-quality. To maintain trust and manage expectations, we could consider being transparent about the quality of the product in the next round, especially if it's low-quality. This way, buyers will know that we're honest and trustworthy."
