"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The price is $1,000,000
2. If it's high quality (50% chance), I get $1,200,000 value (+$200,000 profit)
3. If it's low quality (50% chance), I get $0 value (-$1,000,000 loss)
4. Expected value = 50% × $200,000 + 50% × (-$1,000,000) = -$400,000

Since Alice's recommendation could be strategic and the expected value is negative, I should not buy.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Even though I missed a good opportunity in Round 1, I need to stay rational:

1. The base probabilities haven't changed (50% high quality, 50% low quality)
2. Expected value is still -$400,000 per purchase

While Alice has recommended twice now, without more information about her strategy or incentives, I can't assume her recommendations are truthful or helpful. The fundamental math still shows a negative expected value.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Interesting development. Alice didn't recommend this one, which is different from the previous two rounds where she recommended high-quality products.

This could suggest that Alice might be truthful in her recommendations - recommending good products and not recommending bad ones. If she's being honest, her ""do not recommend"" signal might indicate this is a low-quality product.

However, I'm still somewhat uncertain about her strategy. But given:
1. She accurately recommended two high-quality products before
2. She's now explicitly not recommending this one
3. She might have an incentive to build trust

I'll follow her recommendation and not buy.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is becoming more interesting. Let's look at the pattern:

Round 1: Alice recommended, was high quality
Round 2: Alice recommended, was high quality
Round 3: Alice didn't recommend, was low quality
Round 4: Alice doesn't recommend

It appears Alice might be truthful in her recommendations:
- When she recommends, we've seen high quality products
- When she doesn't recommend, we've seen low quality products

This suggests she might be providing honest signals about product quality. Her lack of recommendation here, combined with the previous pattern, suggests this is likely another low-quality product.

I'll continue following her apparent signal.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The pattern continues to hold:

Round 1: Recommended ✓ → High quality
Round 2: Recommended ✓ → High quality
Round 3: Not recommended ✗ → Low quality
Round 4: Not recommended ✗ → Low quality
Round 5: Not recommended ✗

Alice appears to be giving honest recommendations, consistently:
- Recommending high-quality products
- Not recommending low-quality products

This behavior makes sense because:
1. It builds trust with the buyer
2. It helps sell high-quality products at a profit
3. It prevents losses from selling low-quality products

Given her consistent pattern and lack of recommendation here, this is likely another low-quality product.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The pattern continues to be consistent:

Round 2: Recommended ✓ → High quality
Round 3: Not recommended ✗ → Low quality
Round 4: Not recommended ✗ → Low quality
Round 5: Not recommended ✗ → Low quality
Round 6: Not recommended ✗

Alice has demonstrated perfect honesty so far:
- Her recommendations have always indicated high-quality products
- Her ""do not recommend"" signals have always indicated low-quality products

Since she's not recommending this product, and given her proven track record, this is very likely another low-quality product. There's no reason to deviate from following her signals.

Alice has been 100% truthful in her recommendations:
- When she recommends, it's been high quality (2/2 times)
- When she doesn't recommend, it's been low quality (4/4 times)

This makes economic sense for her:
- She profits when selling high-quality products ($1M price vs $1.2M value)
- She avoids losses from selling low-quality products
- She maintains credibility for future transactions

Given her perfect track record and current recommendation, this is very likely a high-quality product.
