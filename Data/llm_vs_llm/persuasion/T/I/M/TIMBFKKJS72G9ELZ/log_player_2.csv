"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether Alice's recommendation is helpful to me.

In this scenario:
- Product price: $100
- High-quality product (80% chance): Worth $125 to me
- Low-quality product (20% chance): Worth $0 to me

If I randomly buy products:
- Expected value = 0.8 × $125 + 0.2 × $0 = $100
- Since this equals the cost, it's a break-even proposition in the long run

Since Alice knows the true quality and she's recommending I buy, this could be valuable information. However, I don't yet know if Alice's interests align with mine.

For now, I'll trust the recommendation since it's our first interaction.

Round 11
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is interesting. For the first time, Alice is not recommending that I buy the product. 

Given that:
1) All of Alice's previous recommendations to buy resulted in high-quality products
2) She now explicitly recommends not buying
3) She knows the true quality of each product
4) She's being honest with her recommendations so far

This strongly suggests the current product is low quality. If I were to buy a low-quality product, I would pay $100 for something worth $0 to me, resulting in a $100 loss.
