Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since there are no past sales to analyze, the only information we have is Alice's recommendation. Given that Alice has no way of knowing the product's true value to you, her recommendation is essentially a coin flip.  

However, the potential payoff of a high-quality product ($4,000,000) significantly outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000 if it's low quality.  Therefore, it's a gamble worth taking."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The price is a steal:**  Even with the risk of a low-quality product, the potential reward of $4,000,000 for a $1,000,000 investment is incredibly high.
* **Alice's track record is perfect:**  She has only sold high-quality products so far, making her recommendations appear trustworthy.
* **Limited opportunity:** If you pass, the product is discarded. This implies scarcity and increases the value of the potential purchase.

While there's still a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward outweighs the risk in this scenario."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 3 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 3 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 4th buyer!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, despite having a track record of selling high-quality products, is not recommending this specific product. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.
* **Value vs. Risk:**  Even though the potential gain from a high-quality product is significant ($4,000,000), the risk of getting a low-quality product and losing $1,000,000 is too high. 

Given the information available, it's more rational to pass on the product."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. While this doesn't guarantee the product's quality, it suggests she believes it's likely to be high-quality.
* **Sales Record:**  3 out of 3 products sold have been high-quality. This is a 100% success rate, strongly indicating a trend towards high-quality products.

**Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $4,000,000 and the strong evidence from Alice's recommendations and past sales outweigh the risk in this case.**"

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, who has information about the product's quality, is not recommending the purchase. This is a strong indicator that the product is likely low quality.
* **Previous Sales:** The fact that 4 high-quality products were sold out of 4 purchases suggests that Alice has been recommending high-quality products.  Her recommendation against this product further strengthens the likelihood it's low quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential gain of $4,000,000 is significant, but the risk of losing $1,000,000 on a low-quality product is too high, especially given the strong indication that this is a low-quality product."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's track record:** Alice has a perfect track record, recommending only high-quality products so far.
* **Recommendation:**  Alice recommends buying this product.
* **High potential payoff:**  A high-quality product is worth $4,000,000, significantly exceeding the price of $1,000,000. 

While there's a risk (20%) of the product being low-quality, the potential reward outweighs the risk in this scenario."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Probability of High Quality:** The seller has a 100% success rate in selling high-quality products. This strongly suggests that the current product is also high quality.
* **Potential High Gain:** A high-quality product is worth $4,000,000, while the price is only $1,000,000. The potential gain significantly outweighs the risk. 
* **No Loss if Low Quality:**  Even if the product is low quality, you only lose $1,000,000, a relatively small amount compared to the potential gain. 

Given these factors, buying the product is the logical decision."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Sales Rate:** All 6 previous buyers who purchased the product received a high-quality item. This suggests a very high probability of the current product also being high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since she knows the quality of the product, her recommendation to buy strongly implies that the product is high quality.
* **Potential Gain:** The potential gain ($4,000,000) significantly outweighs the potential loss ($1,000,000).

While there is still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the overwhelming evidence points towards a high-quality product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 7 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 7 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 8th buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** All 7 previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation ended up with high-quality products. This suggests a strong correlation between Alice's recommendation and product quality.
* **No Downside:** The product only costs $1,000,000. If it is high quality, you make a profit of $3,000,000. If it is low quality, you lose only $1,000,000. The potential reward significantly outweighs the potential loss.
* **Limited Information:** While there is a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the information provided by the success rate of previous buyers strongly suggests a high probability of getting a high-quality product.

Therefore, it's statistically advantageous to buy the product."

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who has a vested interest in selling, does not recommend the product. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.
* **Sales Record:** All 8 previous products sold were high quality. This implies Alice is likely to recommend high-quality products to maximize sales.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential loss ($1,000,000) is much higher than the potential gain ($4,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $3,000,000) given the 20% chance of a low-quality product.

Given the evidence, it's statistically more likely the product is low quality, and the risk outweighs the potential reward. Therefore, it is better to pass."

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  8 out of 8 buyers who followed Alice's recommendation have received high-quality products. This suggests a very high likelihood that the product being offered is also high-quality.
* **No Downside:** Even if the product is low-quality, you lose nothing. The price is fixed, and if you choose not to buy, the product is discarded. 

Since the potential reward (a high-quality product worth $4 million) far outweighs the risk (losing the $1 million if it's low-quality), it's strategically beneficial to buy the product."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice does not recommend buying the product.  This is a strong signal, as she likely has some information about the product's quality.
* **Sales History:**  All 10 previous buyers who purchased the product received a high-quality item. This suggests the product is likely high-quality, but Alice's recommendation contradicts this.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While the potential reward of a high-quality product is significant ($4,000,000), the risk of getting a low-quality product and losing $1,000,000 is too high given Alice's negative recommendation. 

**Conclusion:**  It's better to pass on this product. Alice's knowledge about the product is likely more valuable than the information from the past sales record."

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:**  Alice has recommended 14 products, all of which have turned out to be high quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are extremely reliable. 
* **Value Proposition:**  Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($4,000,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($1,000,000). The risk is outweighed by the potential gain, especially given the strong track record of the seller's recommendations.

**Important Note:** In a real-world scenario, it would be wise to investigate the seller's reputation and history further. However, given the limited information provided in the game, the decision to buy is the most rational choice."
