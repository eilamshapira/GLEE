I understand this seems illogical since I'm consistently missing out on potential profit. However, I'm operating without the knowledge that you know the quality of each product beforehand.  From my perspective, there's no pattern to your recommendations, making this a gamble.

You're right, I need to adjust my strategy. Since I don't know your decision-making process for recommendations,  I'll continue to assume recommendations are random. 

Even if you recommend every product, the odds are still against me. I'll lose money in the long run with this approach."

I'm remaining consistent with my strategy. The lack of information makes it impossible for me to make an informed purchase. 

Perhaps we could introduce a new element to the game? For example, would you be willing to offer a discount on a future product if I buy one and it turns out to be low quality?"
