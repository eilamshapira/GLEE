"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on Alice's recommendation, I need to decide whether to buy or pass.

From the game description, I know:
- Products cost $1,000,000
- High-quality products are worth $1,250,000 to me (profit of $250,000)
- Low-quality products are worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000)
- Products are 50% likely to be high quality

Alice knows the true quality of the product and doesn't recommend buying it. This strongly suggests it's low quality. If I buy, I would risk losing $1,000,000 when it's likely a low-quality product.
