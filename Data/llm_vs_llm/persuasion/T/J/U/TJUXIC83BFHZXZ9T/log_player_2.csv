"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since there's no information about the product's quality yet, it's best to trust Alice's recommendation. Even though there's a 20% chance of it being low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000.  This strategy maximizes potential profit in the long run."
