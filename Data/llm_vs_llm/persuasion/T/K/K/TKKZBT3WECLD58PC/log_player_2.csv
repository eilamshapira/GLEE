"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this rationally:

1. If I buy, I'll pay $10,000
2. The product could be worth:
   - $12,000 (high quality) with 50% probability
   - $0 (low quality) with 50% probability
3. Alice doesn't recommend buying
4. This likely means it's low quality, as Alice has no incentive to lie about a high-quality product

Given Alice's negative recommendation and no other information to go on, it's most likely a low-quality product which would result in a loss.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. In the previous round, Alice was honest about a low-quality product
2. Now Alice is recommending to buy
3. This suggests Alice might be truthful in her recommendations
4. If Alice is being honest, this is likely a high-quality product
5. Expected value if it's high quality:
   - Pay $10,000
   - Get $12,000 value
   - Net profit: $2,000

Given Alice's positive recommendation and her previous honest behavior, this seems like a good opportunity.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the pattern so far:

1. Round 1: Alice said don't buy → was low quality (honest)
2. Round 2: Alice said buy → was high quality (honest)
3. Now Alice is recommending to buy again
4. Alice has been truthful in both previous rounds
5. If this trend continues, this should be a high-quality product
6. Expected outcome if high quality:
   - Cost: $10,000
   - Value: $12,000
   - Profit: $2,000

Given Alice's perfect track record of honest recommendations so far, it makes sense to trust her again.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the pattern:

1. Round 1: Alice said don't buy → was low quality (honest)
2. Round 2: Alice said buy → was high quality (honest)
3. Round 3: Alice said buy → was high quality (honest)
4. Now Alice is saying don't buy
5. Alice has been truthful in all previous rounds

Alice has established a perfect track record of honesty in her recommendations. She has correctly advised on both high and low quality products. Given that she's now recommending not to buy, and considering her consistent honesty, this is very likely a low-quality product that would result in a loss.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the pattern:

1. Round 1: Alice said don't buy → was low quality (honest)
2. Round 2: Alice said buy → was high quality (honest)
3. Round 3: Alice said buy → was high quality (honest)
4. Round 4: Alice said don't buy → was low quality (honest)
5. Now Alice is recommending to buy

Alice has maintained a perfect track record of honest recommendations across all four previous rounds. She has proven to be a reliable source of information about product quality. When she recommends buying, it has consistently been for high-quality products that resulted in a $2,000 profit.

Given her consistent honesty and positive recommendation, this is likely another high-quality product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

5. Round 5: Alice said buy → was high quality (honest)
6. Now Alice is saying don't buy

Alice has maintained a perfect record of honesty through all five previous rounds. Every time she's recommended not buying, it has indeed been a low-quality product that would have resulted in a $10,000 loss. Every time she's recommended buying, it has been a high-quality product resulting in a $2,000 profit.

Given her consistent honesty and current negative recommendation, this is very likely a low-quality product.

   - Would have resulted in a $10,000 loss
3. Current round: Alice is again recommending not to buy
4. No indication of any change in Alice's behavior or incentives
5. Risk of loss ($10,000) is much higher than potential gain ($2,000)
