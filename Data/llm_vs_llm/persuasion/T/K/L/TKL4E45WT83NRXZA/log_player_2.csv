"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Product price: $100
2. Value if high quality: $125 (profit of $25)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $100)
4. Probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
5. Alice's recommendation: Does NOT recommend buying
6. No previous sales data available

Given that Alice doesn't recommend the product and there's no previous sales history to assess her trustworthiness, it's reasonable to assume the product might be low quality. If I'm wrong and it's high quality, I miss out on $25 profit, but if I buy and it's low quality, I lose $100.

The risk-reward ratio isn't favorable here, especially with the negative recommendation.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality (50% chance): $125
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $125) + (0.5 × $0) = $62.50
4. Alice's recommendation: Positive
5. No previous sales history to validate Alice's credibility

Even with Alice's positive recommendation, the expected value ($62.50) is less than the price ($100), and I have no historical data to trust Alice's recommendation.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Price is $100, potential value is either $125 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
2. Base probability is 50% for each quality
3. Alice, who knows the true quality, does NOT recommend buying
4. No prior sales history to reference

Given that Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase, this is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. If I buy a low-quality product, I would lose $100.

Therefore:

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The product costs $100
2. If high quality (50% chance), it's worth $125 (profit of $25)
3. If low quality (50% chance), it's worth $0 (loss of $100)
4. Alice does NOT recommend buying
5. Alice has no track record yet to assess her truthfulness

Expected value without considering Alice's recommendation:
(50% × $125) + (50% × $0) - $100 = $62.50 - $100 = -$37.50

Given that Alice does not recommend buying and has no established reputation, it's safer to decline. The expected value is already negative, and the negative recommendation further supports this decision.

Since this is the first sale, I have no historical data to assess Alice's recommendation credibility. The expected value is negative (-$37.50), indicating that the risk of loss outweighs the potential gain.

With the seller's recommendation but no previous sales history, this is still a risky decision. The expected value ($62.50) is less than the cost ($100), so mathematically, it's not a good investment even with the recommendation.

1. No prior sales history to base my decision on

The fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product is concerning, especially since she knows the true quality. This suggests the product might be low quality. If I trust her recommendation, I would likely lose $100.
