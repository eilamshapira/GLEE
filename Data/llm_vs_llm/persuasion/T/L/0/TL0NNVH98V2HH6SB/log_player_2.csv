Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

The product costs $1,000,000.
If it's high quality (80% chance), it's worth $2,000,000 to me (gain of $1,000,000).
If it's low quality (20% chance), it's worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000).

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $1,000,000) + (0.2 × -$1,000,000) = $800,000 - $200,000 = $600,000

Since the expected value is positive ($600,000), and Alice is recommending the purchase, it's rational to buy the product.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

The product costs $1,000,000.
- If high quality (worth $2,000,000), I gain $1,000,000
- If low quality (worth $0), I lose $1,000,000

Prior probabilities:
- 80% chance of high quality
- 20% chance of low quality

So far, Alice has sold 1 high-quality product to 1 buyer, suggesting her recommendations might be honest.

However, Alice is specifically NOT recommending that I buy this product. Since Alice knows the true quality, this negative recommendation strongly suggests this is a low-quality product.

Given this recommendation, I should adjust my belief about this specific product being high quality significantly downward from the 80% prior probability.

The expected value of purchasing would be negative given Alice's recommendation, so I should decline.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

I know:
- The product has an 80% chance of being high quality
- High quality is worth $2,000,000 to me, low quality is worth $0
- The price is $1,000,000
- Alice recommends that I buy the product
- So far, 1 buyer has purchased and received a high-quality product

The expected value calculation is:
- 80% chance of high quality: 0.8 × $2,000,000 = $1,600,000
- 20% chance of low quality: 0.2 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value: $1,600,000

Since the expected value ($1,600,000) exceeds the price ($1,000,000), and Alice's recommendation aligns with the product being good quality (with a perfect track record so far), buying seems rational.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to decide whether to buy the product or not based on the available information.

Alice has a history of selling 2 products, both high-quality. This suggests Alice has been honest so far. However, Alice is now recommending that I do NOT buy the current product.

Given that:
- The base probability of a high-quality product is 80%
- Alice knows the true quality
- Alice is not recommending this product
- Alice has only sold high-quality products so far

Alice's recommendation against buying strongly suggests this is a low-quality product. There would be no reason for Alice to advise against buying a high-quality product since she earns the same amount ($1,000,000) regardless of quality.

Therefore, I should trust Alice's recommendation in this case.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze whether buying this product is a good decision based on the information given.

Facts:
- Product price: $1,000,000
- If high quality: Worth $2,000,000 to me (profit of $1,000,000)
- If low quality: Worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000)
- Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice's track record: 2 buyers purchased, 2 high-quality products sold
- Alice recommends I buy the product

Alice's recommendation and perfect track record so far (2/2 high quality) suggest this product is likely high quality. The expected value calculation supports buying:

- If I buy: 0.8 × $1,000,000 - 0.2 × $1,000,000 = $600,000 (positive expected value)
- Alice's recommendation and track record further increase the likelihood of high quality

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether to buy this product based on the information provided.

Given information:
- Each product has an 80% chance of being high quality and 20% chance of being low quality.
- A high-quality product is worth $2,000,000 to me, while a low-quality product is worth $0.
- The price is $1,000,000.
- Alice has sold to 3 previous buyers, and all 3 received high-quality products.
- Alice does NOT recommend I buy the current product.

Since Alice knows the true quality of the product and is not recommending purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If I purchased a low-quality product, I would lose my entire $1,000,000 investment.

The fact that all previous sales were high quality doesn't override Alice's direct recommendation against purchase for my specific product.

The expected value calculation:
- Price: $1,000,000
- Value if high quality (80% chance): $2,000,000
- Value if low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value = (0.8 × $2,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $1,600,000

Since the expected value ($1,600,000) exceeds the price ($1,000,000), it would be rational to buy.

Additionally, Alice has sold 3 products so far, and all 3 were high quality. This suggests Alice's recommendations are reliable. Alice is now recommending that I buy the current product, which further supports making the purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this carefully.

In this scenario:
- Each product has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $2M to me) and 20% chance of being low quality (worth $0)
- The product costs $1M
- Alice recommends that I buy the product
- 4 previous buyers purchased products based on Alice's recommendations
- All 4 products sold were high quality

The expected value of a random product is: 0.8 × $2M + 0.2 × $0 = $1.6M, which exceeds the $1M price.

More importantly, Alice's track record shows perfect accuracy so far - she has recommended 4 products, all of which were high quality. This suggests her recommendations are reliable.

Given Alice's perfect track record of recommendations and the positive expected value, I should purchase this product.

- Alice is selling for $1,000,000
- All 5 previous buyers purchased, and all 5 got high-quality products
- Alice does NOT recommend I buy this product

Alice's recommendation is significant - she knows the product quality and is choosing not to recommend it. Given that all previous sales were high quality, and now she's specifically not recommending this product, this strongly suggests the current product is low quality.

If Alice were randomly or consistently recommending products regardless of quality, the previous sales data would be more relevant. But her differential recommendation here provides direct information.

Given Alice's negative recommendation, the expected value is likely below the $1,000,000 price.
