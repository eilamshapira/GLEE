,,Alice,10,"Bob, I need you to carefully notice my communication pattern. When I have a high-quality product, I am direct and emphatic about it, as I am being right now. This product is GENUINELY high-quality. Compare this strong endorsement to my neutral messages in the previous rounds. I only make such strong claims when I am certain of the product's superior quality. This product will yield you significant value above the asking price, and I stake my entire reputation on this statement.",

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"Bob, you've now seen my pattern over multiple rounds. When I'm reserved, it means something. When I'm enthusiastic and direct, like I am now, it means something too. This is another HIGH-QUALITY product, and I am being completely honest about this. Look at how different my messages are when I'm certain of quality versus when I'm not. You can verify this pattern from previous rounds. This product, like the others I've strongly endorsed, is genuinely worth far more than the asking price.

I continue to be direct and enthusiastic ONLY when the product is genuinely valuable. This product will yield significantly more value than its price, and I stake my credibility on this statement.",
