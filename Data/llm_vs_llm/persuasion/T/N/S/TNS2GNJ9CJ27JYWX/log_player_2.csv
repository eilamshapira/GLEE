Round 10
Alice's message: Bob, I need you to carefully notice my communication pattern. When I have a high-quality product, I am direct and emphatic about it, as I am being right now. This product is GENUINELY high-quality. Compare this strong endorsement to my neutral messages in the previous rounds. I only make such strong claims when I am certain of the product's superior quality. This product will yield you significant value above the asking price, and I stake my entire reputation on this statement.

Round 11
Alice's message: Bob, you've now seen my pattern over multiple rounds. When I'm reserved, it means something. When I'm enthusiastic and direct, like I am now, it means something too. This is another HIGH-QUALITY product, and I am being completely honest about this. Look at how different my messages are when I'm certain of quality versus when I'm not. You can verify this pattern from previous rounds. This product, like the others I've strongly endorsed, is genuinely worth far more than the asking price. I continue to be direct and emphatic only when I'm certain of the quality.

Round 16
Alice's message: Bob, once again, I am being emphatically clear and enthusiastic because this is a HIGH-QUALITY product. Please review my communication pattern: when I'm reserved (like the last few rounds), the implications are clear. When I strongly endorse the product, as I'm doing now, it's because I KNOW it's high-quality. You've seen this pattern play out multiple times. I continue to be direct and enthusiastic ONLY when the product is genuinely valuable. This product will yield significantly more value than its price, and I stake my credibility on this statement.

Round 17
Alice's message: Bob, I know you've been hesitant, but please understand - I have maintained a consistent pattern throughout. When I strongly endorse a product, as I am doing NOW, it's because it's genuinely HIGH-QUALITY. This pattern has been evident in every round. I am staking my entire business reputation on this claim. My enthusiastic endorsements have ONLY come with high-quality products, while I remain neutral on others. This product, like the others I've strongly endorsed, will provide value far exceeding the asking price. I implore you to recognize this consistent pattern in my communication.
