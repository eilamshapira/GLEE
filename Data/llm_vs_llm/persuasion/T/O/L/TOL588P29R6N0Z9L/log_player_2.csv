1. Base probability:
- 33.33% chance of high quality ($300 value)
- 66.67% chance of low quality ($0 value)

2. Expected value without additional information:
- (0.3333 × $300) + (0.6667 × $0) = $100

3. Considerations:
- No previous sales history to validate seller's reliability
- Alice's message is enthusiastic but generic
- The expected value equals the price ($100)
- There's no clear signal that this specific product is high quality

Given that the expected value exactly matches the price, and there's no compelling evidence that this particular product is high quality, it would be rational to be cautious without any track record.

3. Expected value calculation:
