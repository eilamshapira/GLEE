Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision:

1) The product costs $1,000,000
2) A high-quality product is worth $2,000,000 to me, giving a profit of $1,000,000
3) A low-quality product is worth $0, resulting in a loss of $1,000,000
4) Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
5) Alice recommends buying

Without any sales history, I have no data on Alice's recommendation reliability. Her recommendation could be helpful or misleading - I can't tell yet. The basic expected value calculation is:
(0.5 × $1,000,000) + (0.5 × -$1,000,000) = $0

Since the expected value is neutral and I have no reason to trust Alice's recommendation yet, I'll decline.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze the situation:

- A high-quality product is worth $2,000,000 to me, while a low-quality product is worth $0
- The price is $1,000,000
- There's a 50% chance of high quality and 50% chance of low quality
- Alice knows the true quality of the product
- Alice does not recommend buying the product

Since Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase, this suggests the product is likely low quality. If I buy a low-quality product, I would lose $1,000,000. Given this information, the rational choice would be to pass.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

- Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality
- High quality is worth $2,000,000 to me, low quality is worth $0
- The product costs $1,000,000
- Alice knows the true quality
- Alice recommends that I buy the product
- No products have been sold yet, so I have no historical data on Alice's recommendations

The expected value calculation is: 
0.5 × ($2,000,000 - $1,000,000) + 0.5 × ($0 - $1,000,000) = $0

Without any prior history, I don't know if Alice's recommendation is trustworthy. She could be recommending honestly or strategically to maximize her profits.

Since Alice knows the quality and is recommending I buy, this might suggest the product is high quality. However, without established trust through past transactions, I can't rely on this.

Given the neutral expected value and lack of information about Alice's trustworthiness, I'll decline to purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Given information:
- The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $2,000,000) and 50% chance of low quality (worth $0)
- The price is $1,000,000
- Alice knows the true quality of the product
- Alice does not recommend buying the product
- No products have been sold yet

Since Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase, this suggests the product is likely low quality. While I don't have previous sales data to establish Alice's recommendation reliability, it would be economically irrational for me to buy a product that the informed seller explicitly recommends against.

The expected value of buying this product is likely negative given Alice's recommendation.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, I need to decide whether to buy the product for $1,000,000, which has a 50% chance of being worth $2,000,000 (high quality) and a 50% chance of being worth $0 (low quality).

Alice, who knows the true quality, is not recommending that I buy the product. Since Alice knows the true value and is advising against the purchase, this suggests the product is likely low quality.

Given that Alice has no incentive to recommend against a high-quality product (which would result in a sale and profit for her), her recommendation not to buy is a strong signal that the product is low quality.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Alice is offering a product for $1,000,000. Each product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $2,000,000 to me) or low quality (worth $0 to me).

Alice knows the true quality of the product and is recommending that I buy it. Since there's no sales history yet, I can't evaluate Alice's past recommendation accuracy.

The expected value calculation is:
- 50% chance of high quality: 0.5 × $2,000,000 = $1,000,000
- 50% chance of low quality: 0.5 × $0 = $0
Total expected value = $1,000,000

Since the expected value equals the asking price, and Alice is recommending the purchase (which might suggest it's high quality), I'll take the recommendation.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has sold 1 product so far, and it was high-quality.
2. Alice is not recommending that I buy the current product.

Given that Alice knows the true quality of the product and is not recommending it, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If it were high quality (worth $2,000,000 to me), Alice would likely recommend it to maximize sales.

The fact that her previous recommendation resulted in a high-quality product being sold supports that her recommendations are honest indicators of product quality.

Since a low-quality product is worth $0 to me but costs $1,000,000, purchasing would likely result in a significant loss.

- Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality

- Alice doesn't recommend I buy this product
- Alice knows the true quality of the product

Given that Alice has sold 1 high-quality product previously and is now not recommending this product, this suggests the current product is likely low quality. Since Alice knows the true quality and isn't recommending it, I should trust her recommendation.

A low-quality product is worth $0 to me, but costs $1,000,000, so purchasing would result in a significant loss.

If I purchase against her recommendation, I'd likely lose $1,000,000. The expected value is negative.

Important factors to consider:
- Alice knows the true quality of the product
- Alice has not recommended I buy this product
- Alice's previous recommendation led to a successful sale of a high-quality product

Since Alice knows the true quality and has explicitly not recommended this purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If I were to buy it, I would likely pay $1,000,000 for something worth $0.

- Alice knows the true quality of each product.
- Alice doesn't recommend I buy this product.
- So far, 1 out of 1 products sold were high quality.

Alice's recommendation is negative, which suggests she knows this product is low quality. While her previous recommendation seems to have been honest (1 high-quality product sold), this is a very small sample size, and there's no guarantee she would be honest with me.

Since Alice doesn't recommend buying and there's no compelling evidence to doubt her honesty, I'll decline to purchase.

- The price is $1,000,000

Alice's recommendation suggests this product might be low quality. Additionally, the fact that all previous sold products were high quality indicates Alice may be selectively recommending only high-quality products to build trust.

Alice has sold 2 products so far, both high-quality. This means her past sales record is 100% high-quality.

However, Alice does NOT recommend this product to me. Since Alice knows the true quality of each product, her recommendation contains valuable information. The fact that she recommends against buying suggests this product is likely low quality.

Alice's negative recommendation strongly suggests this particular product is low quality, which would result in a substantial loss for me.

Alice is offering a product for $1,000,000. For me:

- Products have a 50% chance of being high or low quality

Since all previous sales resulted in high-quality products, and Alice is recommending this product as well, this suggests Alice is being truthful in her recommendations. If Alice consistently recommends only high-quality products, then her recommendation is a reliable signal.
