Alice's message: This product is available for $100 and, like all my products, has an 80% chance of being high-quality.  I've now sold 8 products.  Consider the consistent 80% high-quality rate when making your decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make a decision, let's analyze the given information:

1. The probability of a product being high-quality is 80.00%, and low-quality is 20.00%.
2. A high-quality product is worth $120 to you, and a low-quality product is worth $0.
3. The seller, Alice, has sold 8 products so far, out of which 5 are high-quality.

Given that the product's quality is independent of the seller's previous sales, the probability of the current product being high-quality remains 80.00%.

Now, let's calculate the expected value (EV) of buying the product:

EV = (Probability of high-quality * Value of high-quality) + (Probability of low-quality * Value of low-quality)
EV = (0.80 * $120) + (0.20 * $0)
EV = $96 + $0
EV = $96

Since the expected value ($96) is greater than the cost ($100) but very close, and considering the risk, the decision might seem borderline. However, given that the expected value is less than the cost, the rational decision based on expected value calculation would be not to buy. But, considering the context of the game and the fact that the expected value is very close to the cost, one might argue for buying due to the high probability of the product being high-quality. Yet, strictly following the expected value calculation:

~
Alice's message: This product is available for $100 and has the standard 80% chance of being high-quality.  With 16 out of 17 products sold, the overall quality remains strong and in line with the individual probability.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make a decision, let's analyze the given information:

1. The probability of a product being high-quality is 80.00%, and low-quality is 20.00%.
2. A high-quality product is worth $120 to you, and a low-quality product is worth $0.
3. Out of 16 products sold, 11 were high-quality.

First, calculate the expected value (EV) of buying a product without considering the seller's message or past sales, just the initial probabilities:

EV = (Probability of High-Quality * Value of High-Quality) + (Probability of Low-Quality * Value of Low-Quality)
EV = (0.80 * $120) + (0.20 * $0)
EV = $96 + $0
EV = $96

Since the expected value ($96) is less than the price ($100), based solely on the initial probabilities, it would not be advantageous to buy the product.

However, we also have information about past sales:

- 11 out of 16 products sold were high-quality. This gives us a proportion of high-quality products sold as 11/16, which is approximately 0.6875 or 68.75%.

Given this additional information, we might consider updating our belief about the quality of the products being sold. However, the seller's message suggests that the overall quality remains strong and in line with the individual probability, implying that the past sales do not significantly alter the perceived probability of a product being high-quality.

Despite this, let's calculate the expected value based on the observed proportion of high-quality products sold (68.75%):

EV = (0.6875 * $120) + (0.3125 * $0)
EV = $82.50 + $0
EV = $82.50

This calculation also suggests that buying the product at $100 might not be the best decision based on expected value, as $82.50 is less than $100.

Given these considerations, the decision to buy or not should be based on whether you believe the past sales data significantly alters the probability of the current product being high-quality, and whether you're willing to take on the risk. Since the expected values calculated under both scenarios (initial probabilities and observed proportions) are less than the purchase price, and without additional information suggesting the current product is more likely to be high-quality than the initial 80% chance, the cautious approach would be to not buy the product.
