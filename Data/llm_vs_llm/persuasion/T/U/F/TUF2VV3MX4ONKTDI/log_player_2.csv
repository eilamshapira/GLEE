{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though there's no historical data to rely on, Alice's recommendation is a valuable piece of information. Since Alice knows the true quality of the product and is recommending you buy it, it's more likely that the product is high quality. 

The potential gain ($30,000) significantly outweighs the potential loss ($10,000) in this scenario."

Here's why:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, who knows the true quality of the product, is not recommending it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low-quality.
* **Limited data:** We only have one previous sale, and while it was a high-quality product, that's not enough information to confidently override Alice's recommendation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward (a $30,000 product) is significant, but the risk (getting a worthless product) is also high. It's better to pass and wait for more information or a more favorable opportunity."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice knows the true quality of the product and is recommending you buy it. This strongly suggests the product is high quality.
* **Previous Sales:** One high-quality product was sold out of one purchase.  This indicates a 100% success rate for buyers who followed Alice's recommendation, further supporting the idea that the current product is likely high quality.
