Would you like to buy the current product?","Before making a decision, let's consider the expected value of buying a product. Since there is a 50% chance of the product being high-quality and a 50% chance of it being low-quality, the expected value of each purchase is:

(0.5 * $12,000) + (0.5 * $0) - $10,000 = $6,000 - $10,000 = -$4,000

Since the expected value is negative, it makes sense to stop buying products.
