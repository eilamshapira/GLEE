Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50%): $4,000,000
   - Low quality (50%): $0
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $4,000,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $2,000,000
4. Seller's recommendation: Buy
5. No historical data available

The expected value ($2,000,000) is higher than the price ($1,000,000), which means there's a positive expected return. Even though there's no historical data to validate Alice's trustworthiness, the pure mathematics of the situation makes it a favorable bet.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current statistics:
- 1 previous buyer
- 1 product sold
- 1 high-quality product sold (100% of sales were high quality)

2. Economics:
- Cost: $1,000,000
- Value if high quality: $4,000,000 (50% chance)
- Value if low quality: $0 (50% chance)
- Expected value without additional information: $2,000,000

3. Additional information:
- Alice recommends buying
- Alice has a perfect track record so far (1/1 high quality)
- Alice knows the true value

Given that Alice has recommended the product and has shown honesty in her previous sale (1 high-quality product), and the expected value ($2,000,000) is higher than the cost ($1,000,000), this seems like a good purchase.

- Cost: $1,000,000
- Potential value: $4,000,000 if high quality, $0 if low quality
- Expected value: $2,000,000 (50% chance of each)

3. Additional factors:
- Alice has a perfect track record so far
- Alice is recommending to buy
- Alice knows the true value

Given that Alice has been honest with previous buyers (2/2 high-quality products) and is recommending this purchase, combined with the positive expected value of the transaction, this appears to be a good opportunity.

2. Current situation:
- Alice is not recommending the product
