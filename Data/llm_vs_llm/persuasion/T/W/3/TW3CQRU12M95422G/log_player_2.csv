Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Facts:
- The product costs $10,000
- High-quality product (33.33% chance) is worth $12,000 to me
- Low-quality product (66.67% chance) is worth $0 to me
- Alice recommends buying the product
- No previous sales data exists

Expected value calculation:
(0.3333 × $12,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $4,000

Since the expected value ($4,000) is less than the price ($10,000), and there's no track record to evaluate Alice's recommendations, it would be financially unwise to purchase.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","In this case, I need to evaluate whether to buy the product based on the available information:

1) The base probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% (worth $12,000 to me)
2) The base probability of a low-quality product is 66.67% (worth $0 to me)
3) The seller Alice does not recommend buying the product
4) No prior sales data exists yet

Alice has no incentive to recommend against a high-quality product, as selling more products is in her interest. Her recommendation against purchase suggests the product is likely low quality.

The expected value calculation:
- If I believe Alice's recommendation, the product is likely low quality (worth $0)
- The price is $10,000
- Therefore, buying would likely result in a loss of $10,000

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, Alice does not recommend buying the product, which suggests it may be of low quality. Given that:

1. The product costs $10,000
2. A high-quality product is worth $12,000 to me (profit of $2,000)
3. A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
4. The base probability is 33.33% for high quality and 66.67% for low quality
5. Alice has provided a negative recommendation

Without any sales history to evaluate Alice's recommendation patterns, and with her explicitly recommending against purchase, the product is most likely low quality. The expected value calculation also suggests passing is the better option.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether to buy this product based on the information given.

The product costs $10,000.
- If high quality (33.33% chance): Worth $12,000 to me → $2,000 profit
- If low quality (66.67% chance): Worth $0 to me → $10,000 loss

Expected value = (0.3333 × $2,000) + (0.6667 × -$10,000) = $666.60 - $6,667 = -$6,000.40

Alice has recommended I buy the product, but there's no track record to judge her recommendations yet. Since the expected value is negative without additional information about the reliability of Alice's recommendations, the rational decision is to decline.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision about buying a product for $10,000.

The key factors to consider:
- Each product has a 33.33% chance of being high quality (worth $12,000 to me) and 66.67% chance of being low quality (worth $0)
- Alice does not recommend buying this product
- There's no sales history yet to judge Alice's recommendation patterns

When Alice doesn't recommend the product, it suggests she knows it's of low quality. Since a low-quality product is worth $0 to me, buying it would result in a loss of $10,000.

Even though there's a prior 33.33% chance of a product being high quality, Alice's negative recommendation significantly reduces this probability.

However, Alice has provided a negative recommendation. If I assume Alice's recommendation is honest and informative, this suggests the product is more likely to be low quality. Since there's no prior sales history to evaluate Alice's recommendation patterns, and the baseline expected value is already negative, I should decline.

Given information:

- Low-quality product value: $0 (66.67% chance)
- Expected value without additional information: $4,000 (< $10,000 price)
- Alice does not recommend buying this product

Alice has revealed the true quality of the product to me and is not recommending the purchase. Since she knows the true quality and has no incentive to steer me away from a high-quality product, her recommendation suggests this is likely a low-quality product.

Following Alice's recommendation is rational in this scenario.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this decision:

Alice does not recommend buying the product. Given that:
- I know each product has a 33.33% chance of being high quality
- Alice has revealed the true quality of the product to herself
- She's not recommending it
- There's no sales history to evaluate Alice's honesty

Based on her recommendation, it seems likely this product is low quality. Since Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending it, I should trust this signal.

The expected value if I ignore her advice would be:
33.33% × $12,000 + 66.67% × $0 = $4,000, which is less than the $10,000 price.

With Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of high quality is likely even lower.

Alice doesn't recommend the product, which suggests it might be low quality. Given that:

- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me

My expected value calculation:
- If I trust Alice's recommendation, the product is likely low quality
- Expected value = (probability of high quality × $12,000) - $10,000

Since Alice has no established track record yet and is explicitly recommending against the purchase, the rational choice is to follow her recommendation.
