"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

- The fixed price is $100
- High-quality products (worth $120) have an 80% chance of appearing
- Low-quality products (worth $0) have a 20% chance of appearing
- Alice knows the true quality and is recommending I buy this product

Since Alice is recommending I buy the product, it's likely high quality. If I buy it and it's high quality, I gain $20 ($120 value - $100 price). If it's low quality, I lose $100.

Given Alice's recommendation and the prior probabilities, buying seems rational.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $120 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the outcome of the first round and Alice's current recommendation, I'll analyze again:

- Alice correctly recommended a high-quality product in Round 1
- The fixed price remains $100
- High-quality products (worth $120) still have an 80% chance of appearing
- Low-quality products (worth $0) still have a 20% chance of appearing
- Alice is again recommending I buy the product

Since Alice's previous recommendation was accurate, and she's recommending I buy again, I'll continue to trust her recommendation. The expected value remains positive given her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $120 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has been truthful in her recommendations so far, with two high-quality products recommended and both being genuinely high quality.

Let's continue with the analysis:
- Alice's recommendations have been reliable in rounds 1 and 2
- The price remains $100
- A high-quality product worth $120 has an 80% base probability
- A low-quality product worth $0 has a 20% base probability
- Alice is again recommending I buy

Given Alice's consistent accuracy and the potential $20 profit on high-quality items, I'll continue to trust her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $120 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendations have been consistently accurate, with three high-quality products correctly identified so far. This suggests she's being truthful in her recommendations.

The situation remains:
- Price: $100
- High-quality product value: $120 (80% base probability)
- Low-quality product value: $0 (20% base probability)
- Alice continues to recommend buying

Since Alice has been reliable in her previous recommendations and the expected value remains positive with the potential $20 profit, I'll continue to trust her judgment.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $120 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has maintained a perfect track record through four rounds, correctly recommending high-quality products each time. This establishes a strong pattern of trustworthiness.

The parameters remain unchanged:
- Price: $100
- High-quality product value: $120 (80% base probability)
- Low-quality product value: $0 (20% base probability)
- Alice continues to recommend buying

Given Alice's consistent accuracy with her recommendations and the potential $20 profit on each high-quality item, I'll continue to follow her advice.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

- Price: $100
- High-quality product value: $120 (80% base probability) 
- Low-quality product value: $0 (20% base probability)
- Alice continues to recommend buying

With Alice's consistent track record of accurate recommendations and the potential $20 profit for each high-quality item, I'll continue to trust her judgment.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is an interesting development. Alice's recommendation in Round 6 led to a low-quality product, which is the first inaccurate recommendation she's made.

Let me reassess:
- Alice correctly recommended high-quality products in rounds 1-5
- In round 6, she recommended a product that turned out to be low-quality
- Overall accuracy is now 5/6 (about 83%)
- The base probability of a high-quality product is 80%

While Alice's recommendation in round 6 resulted in a loss, her overall recommendation accuracy is still slightly better than the base probability of a high-quality product. Given this single error among multiple correct recommendations, I'll cautiously continue to trust her advice.

The parameters remain:
- Price: $100
- High-quality product value: $120 (80% base probability)
