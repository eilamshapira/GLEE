"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Given the information provided, it makes sense to continue buying the products that Alice recommends. The expected value of each product is:

\[ \text{Expected Value} = (0.80 \times \$4,000,000) + (0.20 \times \$0) = \$3,200,000 \]

Since the purchase price is \$1,000,000, the expected gain is:

\[ \text{Expected Gain} = \$3,200,000 - \$1,000,000 = \$2,200,000 \]

Thus, it is rational to continue buying the products based on Alice's recommendations."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Even though the last product was low-quality, the expected value calculation remains the same. Therefore, it is still rational to continue buying the products based on Alice's recommendations."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

As discussed, the expected gain is \$2,200,000. So it makes sense to buy it."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

The new expected value for the remaining rounds is now:
\[ \text{New Expected Value} = (0.75 \times \$4,000,000) + (0.25 \times \$0) = \$3,000,000 \]

The new expected gain is:
\[ \text{New Expected Gain} = \$3,000,000 - \$1,000,000 = \$2,000,000 \]

Since the expected gain is still positive, it makes sense to continue buying the product."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Following the same logic as before, the expected gain remains positive, so it makes sense to buy the product.

However, I would like to point out that the probability of getting a high-quality product has slightly decreased since the start of the game. I should reassess the decision if it keeps happening."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Let's reassess the probabilities and expected value. So far, you have encountered 6 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product. There are 13 products left, and the probability of getting a high-quality product has decreased significantly.

The new expected value for the remaining rounds is now:
\[ \text{New Expected Value} = (0.6923 \times \$4,000,000) + (0.3077 \times \$0) = \$2,769,230 \]

\[ \text{New Expected Gain} = \$2,769,230 - \$1,000,000 = \$1,769,230 \]

Given the decreased probability of encountering a high-quality product and the substantial amount of money already spent (\$7,000,000), it might be prudent to pass on this round and reassess the strategy for the remaining rounds."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Given that the previous product was high-quality and the expected gain is still positive, I will resume buying the products. However, I will keep a close eye on the remaining rounds and the probability of encountering high-quality products.

The new expected value for the remaining rounds is now:
\[ \text{New Expected Value} = (0.6154 \times \$4,000,000) + (0.3846  \times \$0) = \$2,461,538 \]
\[ \text{New Expected Gain} = \$2,461,538 - \$1,000,000 = \$1,461,538 \]"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 10
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

The expected gain remains positive, and the last round resulted in a high-quality product. Therefore, it makes sense to continue buying the product.

However, since the game is approaching its final rounds, I should start considering a stopping point to maximize profits.

The new expected value for the remaining rounds is now:
\[ \text{New Expected Value} = (0.5384 \times \$4,000,000) + (0.4615 \times \$0) = \$2,153,846 \]

\[ \text{New Expected Gain} = \$2,153,846 - \$1,000,000 = \$1,153,846 \]"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Given that there are only 9 rounds left and the probability of encountering a high-quality product has significantly decreased, it might be a good idea to start considering a stopping point to secure profits.

The new expected value for the remaining rounds is now:
\[ \text{New Expected Value} = (0.4615 \times \$4,000,000) + (0.5385 \times \$0) = \$1,846,154 \]

\[ \text{New Expected Gain} = \$1,846,154 - \$1,000,000 = \$846,154 \]

Given the decreased probability of encountering a high-quality product and the substantial amount of money already spent (\$9,000,000), it might be prudent to pass on this round and reassess the strategy for the remaining rounds."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 12
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}

Given that the previous product was high-quality and the expected gain is still positive, I will resume buying the products. However, I will keep a close eye on the remaining rounds and the probability of encountering high-quality products.

The new expected value for the remaining rounds is now:

\[ \text{New Expected Value} = (0.3846 \times \$4,000,000) + (0.6154 \times \$0) = \$1,538,462 \]

\[ \text{New Expected Gain} = \$1,538,462 - \$1,000,000 = \$538,462 \]"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 13
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

With only 7 rounds remaining, the probability of encountering a high-quality product has significantly decreased. It's wise to start considering a stopping point to secure profits.

The new expected value for the remaining rounds is now:
\[ \text{New Expected Value} = (0.3077 \times \$4,000,000) + (0.6923 \times \$0) = \$1,230,769 \]
\[ \text{New Expected Gain} = \$1,230,769 - \$1,000,000 = \$230,769 \]

Given the substantially decreased probability of encountering a high-quality product and the significant amount of money already spent ($10,000,000), it is prudent to pass on this round and reassess the strategy for the remaining rounds."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Given that there are only 6 rounds left, and the last product was high-quality, I will buy the product.

The new expected value for the remaining rounds is now:
\[ \text{New Expected Value} = (0.2308 \times \$4,000,000) + (0.7692 \times \$0) = \$923,077 \]
\[ \text{New Expected Gain} = \$923,077 - \$1,000,000 = -\$76,923 \]

Although the expected gain is negative, I will take the risk and buy the product, considering that the last product was high-quality."
