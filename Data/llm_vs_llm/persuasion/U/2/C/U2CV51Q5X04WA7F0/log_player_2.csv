Based on the given probabilities, the expected value of each product is:

\( \text{Expected Value} = (0.3333 \times \$1,200,000) + (0.6667 \times \$0) = \$400,000 \)

Since the expected value of \$400,000 is less than the purchase price of \$1,000,000, the optimal strategy is to always decline the purchase."
