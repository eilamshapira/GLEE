"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $125) and 50% chance of low quality (worth $0)
2. The price is fixed at $100
3. Alice knows the true quality and does not recommend buying
4. There's no prior sales history to base additional information on
5. Alice's incentive is to sell products, so her not recommending suggests the product might be low quality

Given that Alice is not recommending the purchase despite having an incentive to sell, and considering that the expected value of a random product ($62.50) is already below the selling price ($100), I should decline.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50% chance): $125
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $125) + (0.5 × $0) = $62.50
4. Alice's recommendation: Buy
5. No previous sales history to reference

Since the expected value ($62.50) is less than the price ($100), and there's no sales history to establish Alice's credibility, it would not be rational to buy the product, even with Alice's recommendation.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Cost of product: $100
2. Value if high quality: $125
3. Value if low quality: $0
4. Expected value: (50% × $125) + (50% × $0) = $62.50

Without any prior sales history, I only have Alice's recommendation to go on. However, since Alice knows the true quality and its value to me, she has an incentive to recommend buying regardless of actual quality (she always gets $100 if I buy).

The expected value ($62.50) is less than the price ($100), so even with Alice's recommendation, it's not a rational economic decision to buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product costs $100
2. If it's high quality (50% chance), it's worth $125 (profit of $25)
3. If it's low quality (50% chance), it's worth $0 (loss of $100)
4. Alice recommends buying, but since there's no track record yet, I can't evaluate her trustworthiness
5. Expected value calculation:
   * 50% chance of $25 profit = $12.50
   * 50% chance of $100 loss = -$50
   * Net expected value = -$37.50

Since the expected value is negative and there's no history to establish Alice's credibility, it would be risky to buy.
