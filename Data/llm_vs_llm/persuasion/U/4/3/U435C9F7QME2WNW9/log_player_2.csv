While I cannot guarantee specific outcomes, I am confident that it presents a valuable proposition for the right buyer. Are you ready to explore this exciting possibility?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $10,000
2. Potential values:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $30,000 
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): $0

4. Considerations:
   - No sales history to evaluate Alice's credibility
   - Alice's message is vague and non-committal
   - The expected value equals the price, making it a break-even proposition

While I understand the importance of due diligence, I assure you this offering stands out. Are you ready to seize this opportunity?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Prior probability of high quality: 33.33%
2. Cost: $10,000
3. Expected value calculation:
   * 33.33% chance of $30,000 = $10,000

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Expected value calculation:
