Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether buying this product makes sense given the information provided.

The product costs $10,000.
If it's high quality, it's worth $12,500 to me (profit of $2,500).
If it's low quality, it's worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000).
Each quality has a 50% probability.

Expected value = 0.5 × $12,500 + 0.5 × $0 = $6,250
This is less than the $10,000 cost.

However, Alice is recommending that I buy the product. Since this is the first sale, I have no history to judge whether Alice's recommendations are reliable. Without evidence of Alice's trustworthiness, I should rely on the expected value calculation.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether I should purchase this product based on the available information.

Alice recommends buying the product, but since there are no previous sales statistics, I have no historical data to judge her recommendation's reliability.

The key factors are:
- Product price: $10,000
- Expected value calculation:
  - 50% chance of high quality (worth $12,500) = $6,250
  - 50% chance of low quality (worth $0) = $0
  - Total expected value = $6,250

Since the expected value ($6,250) is less than the price ($10,000), purchasing would be a negative expected value decision, regardless of Alice's recommendation.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate this situation carefully.

Alice recommends buying the product, but since no products have been sold yet, I don't have any track record to evaluate her trustworthiness. 

Let me analyze the expected value:
- 50% chance of high quality: $12,500 value
- 50% chance of low quality: $0 value
- Expected value: 0.5 × $12,500 + 0.5 × $0 = $6,250

The price is $10,000, but the expected value is only $6,250, which is less than the price.

Without any information about Alice's credibility or the reliability of her recommendations, I should make a decision based purely on the expected value.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully:

- Each product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $12,500) or low quality (worth $0)
- The price is $10,000
- Alice has recommended I buy the product
- There's no sales history to judge Alice's recommendation quality

My expected value calculation:
- If Alice's recommendation is truthful: Expected value = $12,500 > $10,000 price
- If completely random or deceptive: Expected value = 0.5 × $12,500 + 0.5 × $0 = $6,250 < $10,000 price

Without any prior history to judge Alice's recommendations, I don't have evidence that her recommendation provides meaningful information beyond the 50/50 baseline probability. 

The expected value of a random product ($6,250) is less than the price ($10,000).

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully.

Alice recommends buying the product, but I need to consider my expected value:
- If I buy, I pay $10,000
- 50% chance product is high quality (worth $12,500 to me)
- 50% chance product is low quality (worth $0 to me)

Expected value = 0.5 × $12,500 + 0.5 × $0 - $10,000 = $6,250 - $10,000 = -$3,750

Since the expected value is negative, it's not rational for me to buy the product based purely on the prior probabilities. Alice's recommendation might indicate the product is high quality, but without knowing her incentives or the reliability of her recommendations, I can't adjust my probability estimate enough to make this a positive expected value.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

1) The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $12,500) and 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0)
2) The price is fixed at $10,000
3) Alice recommends buying the product
4) There are no previous sales to evaluate Alice's recommendation reliability

My expected value calculation:
- If I buy: (0.5 × $12,500) + (0.5 × $0) - $10,000 = $6,250 - $10,000 = -$3,750
- If I don't buy: $0

Since Alice has an incentive to sell regardless of quality, and there's no track record to establish her trustworthiness, her recommendation alone doesn't change the expected value calculation. The expected value of buying is negative.

The expected value is negative, so in a purely rational calculation, I should not buy.

However, Alice recommends buying the product. Since there are no previous sales, I don't know if Alice's recommendations are trustworthy. Without knowing Alice's incentives or recommendation history, I have no reason to assume the recommendation improves my odds.
