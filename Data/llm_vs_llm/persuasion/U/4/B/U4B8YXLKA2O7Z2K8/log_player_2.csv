Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to decide whether to buy the product based on the available information.

Alice doesn't recommend buying the product, which suggests it might be low quality. Since there's no previous sales record to gauge Alice's honesty, I can only rely on the base probability and Alice's recommendation.

The product has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $400) and a 20% chance of being low quality (worth $0). The expected value would be (0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320, which is higher than the $100 price.

However, Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying. This likely means the product is low quality. If that's the case, I would lose $100 by buying it.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this decision:

- The product costs $100
- It has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $400 to me)
- It has a 20% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me)
- Expected value = 0.8 × $400 + 0.2 × $0 = $320
- Since $320 > $100, buying has positive expected value

Alice is recommending that I buy, which aligns with the mathematical analysis. While there's no sales history to evaluate Alice's trustworthiness, the base probabilities make this a good decision.

"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'll analyze this situation:

- Each product has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $400) and 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)
- The product costs $100
- Alice has recommended that I buy the product
- So far, 1 buyer has purchased based on Alice's recommendations
- That 1 purchase was a high-quality product

The expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 0.8 × $400 + 0.2 × $0 - $100 = $320 - $100 = $220
- If I don't buy: $0

Alice's perfect track record so far (1 for 1 high-quality products) and her recommendation to buy suggest this product is likely high quality. The expected value is significantly positive.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

- The product costs $100
- A high-quality product is worth $400 to me (profit of $300)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $100)
- Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice has sold to 2 previous buyers, both received high-quality products
- Alice is recommending that I buy the product

Given Alice's perfect track record (2/2 high-quality products) and her recommendation to buy, it's very likely this is a high-quality product. The expected value calculation strongly favors buying:

- If I buy: 0.8 × $300 (profit) + 0.2 × (-$100) (loss) = $240 + (-$20) = $220 expected profit

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

- The product costs $100
- If it's high quality (80% chance), it's worth $400 to me
- If it's low quality (20% chance), it's worth $0 to me
- Alice is recommending I buy this product
- Alice's previous recommendations resulted in 3 buyers purchasing, and all 3 received high-quality products

The expected value calculation:
0.8 × $400 + 0.2 × $0 = $320

Since $320 > $100, based on probability alone, buying would be rational.

Additionally, Alice's perfect track record (3/3 high-quality sales) and her recommendation to buy suggest she's being truthful about product quality.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information, I need to decide whether to buy this product or not.

The fixed price is $100. A high-quality product is worth $400 to me (net gain of $300), while a low-quality product is worth $0 (net loss of $100).

Alice has sold 4 products so far, and all 4 were high-quality products. This suggests Alice's recommendations have been reliable. Alice is also recommending that I buy the current product.

Since the base probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and Alice's track record shows 100% high-quality products sold based on her recommendations, buying this product seems like a good decision. The expected value is positive.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze the situation carefully to make an informed decision.

First, let's look at the base probability: any product has an 80% chance of being high quality.

Looking at Alice's track record:
- 5 buyers have purchased products
- 5 high-quality products have been sold
- This means 100% of sold products were high quality

Alice is now recommending that I buy this product. Given her perfect track record so far and her recommendation, it suggests this product is likely high quality.

If I buy a high-quality product for $100, it's worth $400 to me (net gain of $300).
If I buy a low-quality product for $100, it's worth $0 to me (net loss of $100).

Given Alice's recommendation and perfect track record, the expected value is positive.

Alice doesn't recommend buying this product, which is concerning. However, I should also consider the statistical information:
- 6 buyers have purchased products based on Alice's recommendations
- 6 high-quality products have been sold
- The perfect track record suggests Alice's recommendations have been accurate

The prior probability is 80% chance of high quality, but Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending this product. Given that all previous recommendations appear to have been honest (all sold products were high quality), I should take her recommendation seriously.

1. Each product has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $400 to me) and 20% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me).
2. The product costs $100.
3. Alice has sold 6 products so far, and all 6 were high quality.

The expected value of buying the product is:

The fact that all previous sales were high quality products and Alice's recommendation both suggest this is likely a high-quality product. The expected value calculation strongly favors purchasing.

- The seller is recommending that I buy the product
- 9 previous buyers purchased based on Alice's recommendations

Alice seems to be providing honest recommendations so far, with a perfect track record. Since all previous recommendations led to high-quality purchases, and she's recommending I buy this product too, I have good reason to trust her recommendation.

Additionally, the expected value calculation works in favor of buying:
- If high quality (80% chance): Worth $400 - $100 cost = $300 profit
