Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 
   - 50% chance of $200 (high quality)
   - 50% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $200) + (0.5 × $0) = $100

The expected value equals the price, so in purely mathematical terms, this is a fair deal. Alice's recommendation provides some positive signal, though without any track record, it's hard to gauge her credibility.

However, since the price exactly matches the expected value and we have a seller's recommendation, I'll take a chance on this first purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality: $200 (50% chance)
   - Low quality: $0 (50% chance)
3. Historical data:
   - 1 previous buyer
   - 1 high-quality product sold
4. Alice recommends buying

This looks promising because:
1. The previous sale was a high-quality product
2. Alice is giving a positive recommendation
3. Expected value calculation: (50% × $200) + (50% × $0) = $100, which equals the price

Given the positive track record and Alice's recommendation, I'll take the risk.
