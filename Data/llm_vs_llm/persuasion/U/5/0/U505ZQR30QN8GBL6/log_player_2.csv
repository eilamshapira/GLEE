"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully.

Here are the basic parameters:
- Price: $100
- High quality value: $125 (profit = $25)
- Low quality value: $0 (loss = $100)
- Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality

Since this is Round 1, I don't have any information about Alice's recommendation tendencies yet. If Alice were perfectly honest, buying would be the rational choice on average:
Expected value = 0.8 × $125 + 0.2 × $0 - $100 = $100 - $100 = $0

However, Alice knows the product quality and has an incentive to recommend low-quality products since she makes $100 regardless. At this point, I can't distinguish if her recommendation is truthful or strategic.

Given that I have no previous data points and the prior probability favors high quality (80%), I'll take a chance on this first recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to continue evaluating Alice's recommendation patterns.

So far:
- Round 1: Alice recommended buying → Product was high quality → Good outcome (+$25)

Alice has been honest in her first recommendation, which is a positive sign. However, one data point isn't enough to establish a reliable pattern. She could potentially be building trust initially before making strategic recommendations later.

Given that:
1. Alice has been truthful once
2. The prior probability still favors high quality (80%)
3. The expected value calculation without considering Alice's recommendation is neutral

I'll continue with my approach of accepting her recommendation for now, while continuing to gather data about her behavior patterns.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to keep tracking Alice's recommendation patterns.

So far:
- Round 1: Alice recommended buying → Product was high quality → Good outcome (+$25)
- Round 2: Alice recommended buying → Product was high quality → Good outcome (+$25)

Alice has been honest in both of her recommendations, which is building trust. Her recommendations have aligned with high-quality products so far. This suggests she might be recommending truthfully, though it's still early in the game.

Given that:
1. Alice has been truthful twice in a row
2. The prior probability still favors high quality (80%)
3. I've had positive outcomes following her recommendations

I'll continue to follow her recommendation while I gather more data about her behavior patterns.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to continue monitoring Alice's recommendation patterns.

So far:
- Round 1: Alice recommended buying → Product was high quality → Good outcome (+$25)
- Round 2: Alice recommended buying → Product was high quality → Good outcome (+$25)
- Round 3: Alice recommended buying → Product was high quality → Good outcome (+$25)

Alice has consistently recommended high-quality products all three times. This is building a pattern of trustworthy recommendations. While it's still possible she could change her strategy later, her track record is positive so far.

Given that:
1. Alice has been truthful three times consecutively
2. The prior probability favors high quality (80%)
3. I've had consistent positive outcomes following her recommendations (+$75 total profit)

I'll continue to accept her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to continue tracking Alice's recommendation patterns.

So far:
- Round 1: Alice recommended buying → Product was high quality → Good outcome (+$25)
- Round 2: Alice recommended buying → Product was high quality → Good outcome (+$25)
- Round 3: Alice recommended buying → Product was high quality → Good outcome (+$25)
- Round 4: Alice recommended buying → Product was high quality → Good outcome (+$25)

Alice has consistently recommended high-quality products four times in a row. This strengthens the evidence that she's providing honest recommendations. Her track record remains unblemished so far.

Given that:
1. Alice has been truthful four consecutive times
2. The prior probability favors high quality (80%)
3. I've accumulated $100 in profit by following her recommendations
4. There's no indication yet of strategic deception

I'll continue to trust her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is an interesting development - Alice's first non-recommendation.

So far:
- Round 1-5: Alice recommended buying → All products were high quality → Good outcomes (+$125 total)
- Round 6: Alice does NOT recommend buying → Product quality unknown

This is the first time Alice has explicitly advised against buying. Given her perfect track record of honest recommendations so far, this non-recommendation likely indicates that the current product is low quality.

If Alice were being strategic or deceptive, she would likely recommend buying low-quality products (since she profits regardless). The fact that she's explicitly not recommending this product strongly suggests she's continuing to be honest.

Given:
1. Alice's consistent pattern of truthful recommendations
2. The explicit non-recommendation for this product
3. The significant downside of buying a low-quality product (-$100 loss)

I should respect her non-recommendation and decline this purchase.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendation pattern is becoming clearer.

So far:
- Round 1-5: Alice recommended buying → All products were high quality (+$125 total)
- Round 6: Alice did NOT recommend buying → Product was low quality (saved $100)
- Round 7: Alice recommends buying → Product quality unknown

Alice has demonstrated consistent honesty in her recommendations. She recommended high-quality products in rounds 1-5, and correctly advised against a low-quality product in round 6. This strongly suggests she's providing truthful recommendations rather than trying to maximize her own profit.

Given:
1. Alice's perfect track record of truthful recommendations across different scenarios
2. Her willingness to forego a sale when the product was low quality
3. Her current recommendation to buy in round 7
4. The continued positive expected value from following her honest advice

I'll continue to trust her recommendation.

Given:
1. Alice's perfect track record of truthful recommendations across 7 rounds
2. Her consistent willingness to forego sales when products are low quality
