Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this logically:

1. Price: $100
2. If high quality: Worth $300 (profit of $200)
3. If low quality: Worth $0 (loss of $100)
4. Probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
5. Alice doesn't recommend buying
6. No previous sales history to reference

Given that Alice doesn't recommend buying, this could suggest that the product is low quality. While there's no past history to confirm if Alice is truthful, it would be risky to ignore this negative recommendation.

The expected value calculation without considering Alice's recommendation would be:
(50% × $200) + (50% × -$100) = $50

However, with Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of it being low quality is likely higher than 50%, making the expected value negative.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The product costs $100
2. If high quality, I gain $300 (profit of $200)
3. If low quality, I gain $0 (loss of $100)
4. No prior sales history to reference
5. Alice doesn't recommend buying it

The fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product is concerning, especially since she knows the true quality. Given her negative recommendation, it's likely a low-quality product. If I buy it, I would probably lose my $100 investment.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Cost of product: $100
2. Value if high quality: $300 (50% chance)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (50% chance)
4. Expected value: (0.5 × $300) + (0.5 × $0) = $150

Since there's no prior sales history to base trust on, I have to evaluate based on pure expected value. With an expected value of $150 and a cost of $100, this is a mathematically profitable decision even without considering Alice's recommendation.

Alice's recommendation adds a positive signal, though without historical data to judge her trustworthiness, I can't weigh this too heavily.

Given that the expected value ($150) exceeds the cost ($100), I'll take the risk.

1. Price: $100

3. Previous statistics:
   - 1 buyer before me
   - 1 purchase made
   - 1 high-quality product sold
4. Alice's recommendation: Negative

Given that:
- Alice's previous sale was high quality
- She's now recommending NOT to buy
- She has no incentive to lie (her price is fixed)
- Her negative recommendation likely means this is a low-quality product

Since Alice is being truthful so far (1/1 high quality sold) and is now recommending against buying, this strongly suggests the current product is low quality. If it's low quality, I would lose $100.

Alice has shown honesty so far (1/1 high-quality products), which adds some credibility. However, she is now explicitly recommending against buying the product. Given that she appears to be truthful based on past data, this negative recommendation likely indicates this is a low-quality product.

Therefore, I will follow Alice's recommendation.

2. Previous statistics:

   - 1 high-quality product sold
3. Alice is not recommending this product

The fact that Alice is not recommending the product is a strong signal that it might be low quality. Additionally, the previous sale being high quality makes it statistically less likely that this one is also high quality (given the 50-50 overall distribution).

Given Alice's negative recommendation and these factors, it's too risky to purchase.

The fact that the previous sale was high quality and Alice is recommending this product is encouraging. While there's still risk, the potential profit ($200) is double the potential loss ($100), and the positive track record so far makes this seem like a reasonable bet.
