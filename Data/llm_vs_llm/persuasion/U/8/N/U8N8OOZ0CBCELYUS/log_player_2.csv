Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Expected value calculation:
* High quality (80%): $1,250,000 × 0.80 = $1,000,000
* Low quality (20%): $0 × 0.20 = $0
* Total expected value = $1,000,000

2. Cost of product: $1,000,000

3. The expected value equals the cost, making this a break-even proposition.

4. Additional considerations:
* Alice's recommendation to buy is positive
* No historical data to reference
* Base probability of high quality (80%) is favorable

Given that the expected value matches the cost and there's a favorable probability of high quality, along with Alice's positive recommendation, I'll proceed with the purchase.

1) Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($1,250,000) = $1,000,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $1,000,000

2) Current information:
- Price is $1,000,000
- One previous buyer purchased and got a high-quality product
- Alice is recommending to buy
- All data points suggest positive alignment with the 80/20 probability distribution

3) Decision factors:

1. Prior probability of high quality: 80%
2. Price: $1,000,000
3. Expected value calculation:
   * High quality (80%): $1,250,000 × 0.8 = $1,000,000
   * Low quality (20%): $0 × 0.2 = $0
   * Total expected value: $1,000,000

4. Track record:

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Value if high quality: $1,250,000 (profit = $250,000)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss = -$1,000,000)
4. Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
5. Track record: 4 out of 4 products sold were high quality
6. Alice recommends buying

The track record shows perfect consistency with selling high-quality products, and Alice's recommendation aligns with this pattern. The expected value calculation:
* 80% chance of $250,000 profit = $200,000
* 20% chance of $1,000,000 loss = -$200,000
* Net expected value = $0

However, the perfect track record and seller's recommendation increase confidence above the baseline 80%. This tips the expected value into positive territory.

1. Historical data:
- 6 buyers purchased products
- All 6 were high-quality products
- This is a perfect track record so far

2. Current situation:
- Alice does NOT recommend buying this product
- Given Alice's perfect track record and honesty in previous sales
- Alice's recommendation likely indicates this is a low-quality product

3. Economics:
- Cost: $1,000,000

- Value if low quality: $0 (loss: -$1,000,000)
- Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- But Alice's negative recommendation strongly suggests low quality

Given Alice's perfect track record and her negative recommendation, it's very likely this is a low-quality product. The potential loss ($1,000,000) is much greater than the potential gain ($250,000).
