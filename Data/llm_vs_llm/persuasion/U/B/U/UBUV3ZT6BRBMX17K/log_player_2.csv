"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation:

- Each product has a 50% chance of being high/low quality
- High quality = worth $400 to me, low quality = worth $0
- Price is fixed at $100
- Alice knows the true quality of each product
- Alice just recommended I buy this product

Since Alice knows the product's true value, her recommendation might be strategic. In this first round, I don't yet know if Alice's recommendations are reliable or if she's trying to maximize her profit by recommending all products.

The expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 50% chance of $400 value - $100 cost = $150 expected profit
- If I pass: $0

Without any pattern of Alice's behavior yet, I should rely on the expected value, which is positive.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to update my analysis based on this new information:

- In Round 1, Alice recommended a product that was indeed high quality
- In Round 2, Alice is not recommending this product

Given that Alice knows the true quality and her first recommendation was honest, her non-recommendation in this round likely suggests the product is low quality. If Alice is being truthful in her recommendations, I should follow her advice.

If the product is low quality (which seems likely based on Alice's non-recommendation), then:
- If I buy: Pay $100 for something worth $0 to me = $100 loss
- If I pass: $0

Based on this initial evidence that Alice may be providing honest recommendations, I should decline this purchase.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to continue analyzing the pattern of Alice's recommendations:

- Round 1: Alice recommended a product → it was high quality
- Round 2: Alice did not recommend a product → it was low quality
- Round 3: Alice recommends this product

So far, Alice's recommendations appear to be honest and reliable. She has recommended high-quality products and advised against low-quality ones.

Given this pattern:
- If I buy based on her recommendation: Likely to get a high-quality product worth $400 for $100 = $300 profit
- If I pass: $0

Since Alice's recommendations have been trustworthy so far and the expected value is positive, I should follow her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to continue tracking Alice's recommendation pattern:

- Round 1: Alice recommended → high quality (accurate)
- Round 2: Alice did not recommend → low quality (accurate)
- Round 3: Alice recommended → high quality (accurate)
- Round 4: Alice does not recommend

Alice's recommendations have been perfectly accurate so far. She appears to be honestly telling me which products are worth buying and which aren't.

When she doesn't recommend a product, it has been low quality. Following this pattern:
- If I buy: Likely pay $100 for a product worth $0 = $100 loss
- If I pass: $0

Based on Alice's consistent honesty in her recommendations, I should follow her advice and not buy this product.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
