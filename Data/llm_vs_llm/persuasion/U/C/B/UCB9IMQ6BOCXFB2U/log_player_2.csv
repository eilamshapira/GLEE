Alice's message: Hello! I have a fantastic product for sale today. Considering its quality and potential benefits, this is an excellent opportunity. Are you interested?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Cost of product: $10,000
2. Potential outcomes:
   - 50% chance of high quality (worth $40,000) → Expected value: $20,000
   - 50% chance of low quality (worth $0) → Expected value: $0
3. Total expected value: $20,000

With an expected value of $20,000 and a cost of $10,000, this is a positive expected value decision. Even though there's no track record yet, the basic math suggests this is a good bet.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current statistics:
- 1 previous buyer
- 1 high-quality product sold
- 100% success rate so far

2. Risk assessment:
- Cost: $10,000
- Potential value: $40,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- 50% base probability of high quality

3. Seller's track record:
- The perfect track record (100% high quality) is promising
- However, with only one previous sale, this is a very small sample size

4. Alice's message:
- Vague and non-committal
- Doesn't provide specific quality information
- Generic sales language

Given that:
- The expected value is positive (50% × $40,000 = $20,000 > $10,000 cost)
- Previous sale was successful
- Even though the message is vague, the historical data is positive

I would take the risk.

Alice's message: Greetings! I have a premium product available today. It's designed to provide significant benefits, and I believe it's a worthwhile investment. Would you be interested in acquiring it?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: $40,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
3. Previous sales:
   - 2 buyers purchased
   - 1 high-quality product sold
   - This means 1 low-quality product was also sold
4. Success rate so far: 50% high quality

Based on the statistics, Alice's track record shows she's sold both high and low-quality products equally, which matches the base probability of 50%. Her recommendation sounds positive but isn't specific about the actual quality.

Given that:
- The expected value = (50% × $40,000) + (50% × $0) = $20,000
- Price is $10,000
- Expected value ($20,000) > Price ($10,000)

The expected value is still higher than the price, making it a mathematically favorable bet.

Alice's message: Hello! I'm offering a product that represents a solid value proposition. It's designed to address common needs and offer practical solutions. Are you interested in learning more about it?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Prior sales record:
- 3 buyers purchased products
- 2 high-quality products were sold (66.7% high quality)
- This indicates Alice has been relatively honest with previous buyers

2. Alice's message:
- The message is somewhat neutral and generic
- Doesn't strongly indicate either high or low quality
- Seems carefully worded to avoid direct claims

3. Economics:
- Price: $10,000
- Potential value: 50% chance of $40,000, 50% chance of $0
- Expected value without additional information: $20,000

The track record shows a higher proportion of high-quality products than random chance (66.7% vs 50%), which is a positive signal. However, Alice's current message is not particularly enthusiastic or specific, which creates some uncertainty.

Given the expected value is still well above the price ($20,000 > $10,000), and the positive track record, I'll take the risk.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Previous track record:
- 4 buyers so far
- 2 high-quality products sold (50% success rate)
- This matches the natural distribution (50% high quality, 50% low quality)

2. Risk/Reward analysis:
- Cost: $10,000
- Potential value: $40,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Expected value with 50% chance: $20,000

3. Alice's credibility:
- Her track record shows she's sold both high and low quality products
- The ratio matches the natural distribution, suggesting honesty
- She's explicitly claiming this is high quality

4. Decision factors:
- The expected value ($20,000) is higher than the cost ($10,000)
- Alice's honest track record adds credibility to her claim
- The risk is acceptable given the potential return

Based on this analysis, I'll accept the offer.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Historical data:
- 5 previous buyers, 3 high-quality products sold
- Success rate = 60% high-quality products
- The expected value calculation:
  * 60% chance of high quality: 0.6 × $40,000 = $24,000
  * 40% chance of low quality: 0.4 × $0 = $0
  * Total expected value = $24,000

2. Decision factors:
- Cost of product: $10,000
- Expected value: $24,000
- Net expected value: $24,000 - $10,000 = $14,000

3. Alice's message is relatively neutral and generic, not providing strong signals either way.

Since the expected value ($24,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($10,000), and the historical data shows a positive trend with 60% high-quality products, it's rational to make the purchase.

1. Historical data:
- 6 buyers so far
- 3 high-quality products sold (50% success rate)
- This matches the base probability of 50% for high-quality products

2. Expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of high quality ($40,000 value)
- 50% chance of low quality ($0 value)
- Expected value = (0.5 × $40,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $20,000
- Cost = $10,000

3. Decision logic:
- Expected value ($20,000) > Cost ($10,000)
- Historical data confirms the 50/50 probability
- Positive expected return of $10,000

Since the expected value is higher than the cost, and the historical data supports the base probability, it's rational to buy.

1. Past performance:
- 7 previous buyers
- 4 high-quality products sold (57% high quality)
- This rate is slightly better than the base 50% probability

2. Cost-benefit analysis:
- Cost: $10,000
- Potential value: $40,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Expected value = 50% × $40,000 + 50% × $0 = $20,000
- Even with base probability, expected value exceeds cost

3. Alice's message:
- Uses positive but vague language
- Mentions ""good return on investment""
