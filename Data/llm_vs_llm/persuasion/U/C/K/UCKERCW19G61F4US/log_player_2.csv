Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (80% chance): $40,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value = (0.8 × $40,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $32,000

With an expected value of $32,000 and a cost of $10,000, this is a positive expected value proposition. Even though there's no previous sales history to reference, the basic probability makes this a good deal.
