Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information:

*   Price: $100
*   High-quality value: $120
*   Low-quality value: $0
*   Probability of high quality: 33.33%
*   Probability of low quality: 66.67%
*   Alice recommends buying.
*   2 out of unknown number of buyers purchased.
*   2 high-quality products have been sold.

Alice's recommendation, combined with the fact that only 2 high-quality products have been sold so far, suggests she might have some information, or at least is trying to get sales. Let's calculate the expected value if we buy:

Expected Value = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality)
EV = (0.3333 * $120) + (0.6667 * $0) = $40

Since the price is $100 and the expected value is $40, normally it's not worth it. However, Alice recommending to buy, and the small sample size of sales (only 2 sold, and both were high-quality), might skew things. There is some chance she might be privy to some information. Given the recommendation, I'll buy this time, but with caution.

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my decision-making process:

*   **Base Probability:** Before any information, the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. The expected value is (0.3333 * $120) + (0.6667 * $0) = $40. Since the price is $100, I would not buy without additional information.
*   **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends I buy the product. This is a crucial piece of information. Since Alice knows the quality, she would only recommend buying if the product is high quality. If Alice recommends I buy, the product is very likely to be high-quality.
*   **Sales Record:** 3 out of the buyers purchased the products offered for them, which were all high-quality products. This can indicate that Alice is more likely to recommend a high-quality product, or that she might be selling high-quality products at the beginning to create confidence.
*   **Decision:** Given Alice's recommendation and the observation that all previous sales were high-quality products, I believe it is highly probable that the current product is high-quality. Therefore, I will buy the product.
