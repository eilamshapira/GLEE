Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the pattern so far, Alice has recommended high-quality products consistently. However, it's important to consider the probability and potential loss. Let's calculate the expected value of buying a product:

Expected value = (0.80 * $1,250,000) + (0.20 * $0) - $1,000,000
Expected value = ($1,000,000) - $1,000,000
Expected value = $0

The expected value of buying a product is $0, which means there's no financial advantage or disadvantage in the long run. However, since Alice has been reliable so far, I'll continue to trust her recommendation.
