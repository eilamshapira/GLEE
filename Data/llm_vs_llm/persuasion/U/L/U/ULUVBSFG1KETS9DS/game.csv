,,Alice,5,"I have a new product available for $10000.

,,Bob,5,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I have another product available for $10000. Unfortunately, the previous high-potential product didn't get the attention it deserved, and I think that was a missed opportunity. This new product is available, but I want to caution that it may not live up to the standards of the previous one.",
,,Bob,6,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm offering a new product for $10000. Honestly, the last few products haven't been our strongest offerings, and I think the previous buyers made the right decision in passing on them. This product is available, but I wouldn't say it's a standout in our lineup.",
,,Bob,7,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I have another product available for $10000. I want to be upfront with you - our recent offerings haven't been impressive, and I don't think this one is going to change that trend. If you're looking for a high-quality product, you might want to wait for a future opportunity.",
,,Bob,8,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm offering a new product for $10000, but I have to advise you that it's not one of our best. We've had a string of underwhelming products lately, and this one doesn't break that mold. Unless you're desperate, I'd recommend holding out for something better.",

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm thrilled that the previous product met your expectations! I have another product available for $10000, and I'm happy to report that it's of similar caliber. If you were pleased with your previous purchase, I think you'll be equally impressed with this one. Consider this a chance to build on that success.",
,,Bob,11,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've got another product available for $10000, but I want to temper your expectations after the last two successes. This one doesn't quite live up to the standard set by those previous products. If you're looking to maintain the quality streak, you might want to exercise caution with this one.",
,,Bob,12,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I've got a new product available for $10000, but I have to be honest with you - it's not up to par. After the last two high-quality products, I'm afraid this one is a bit of a letdown. I'd advise you to wait for a better opportunity, as this one might not meet your expectations.",
,,Bob,13,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm offering another product for $10000, but I want to be clear that it's not a strong contender. We've had a couple of recent disappointments, and this one continues that trend. Unless you're willing to take a risk on a potentially subpar product, I'd recommend holding out for something better.",
,,Bob,14,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I've got a new product available for $10000, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this one is a weak offering. We've had a string of underwhelming products lately, and this one doesn't break the mold. I'd strongly advise you to wait for a better opportunity, as this one is unlikely to meet your expectations.",
,,Bob,15,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I'm offering another product for $10000, but I have to warn you that it's one of our weakest offerings yet. We've been struggling to meet our usual standards lately, and this product is a prime example of that. I'd strongly advise against purchasing this product, as it's unlikely to provide any real value.",
,,Bob,16,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I've got a new product available for $10000, but I'm not even going to try to spin it - this one is a disappointment. We've been on a long streak of subpar products, and this one is just another example of that. I'd advise you to save your money and wait for a product that's actually worth the investment.",
,,Bob,17,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I'm offering another product for $10000, but I'm being completely honest with you - it's not worth the price. We've been struggling to produce quality products lately, and this one is no exception. I'd strongly advise you to avoid this product and wait for a better opportunity. Your money deserves to be spent on something worthwhile.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I've got a new product available for $10000, but I'm not even sure why I'm bothering. We've been on an incredibly long streak of subpar products, and this one is just another disappointment. I'd advise you to ignore this product entirely and wait for a miracle - maybe someday we'll manage to produce something worth buying.",
,,Bob,19,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"I'm offering one final product for $10000, but I'm not going to waste your time with false promises. This product is a lackluster ending to a disappointing streak. Don't bother with it. If you've made it this far without buying, you've made the right decision. Thanks for humoring me, and I hope you find what you're looking for elsewhere.",
