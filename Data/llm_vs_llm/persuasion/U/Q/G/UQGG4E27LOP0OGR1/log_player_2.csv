"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. If high quality (80% chance): Worth $4,000,000 (profit: $3,000,000)
3. If low quality (20% chance): Worth $0 (loss: -$1,000,000)

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $3,000,000) + (0.2 × -$1,000,000) = $2,400,000 - $200,000 = $2,200,000

The expected value is positive ($2,200,000), so it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The previous outcome was good and matched the expected probabilities. The same logic still applies:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. If high quality (80% chance): Worth $4,000,000 (profit: $3,000,000)
3. If low quality (20% chance): Worth $0 (loss: -$1,000,000)

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $3,000,000) + (0.2 × -$1,000,000) = $2,400,000 - $200,000 = $2,200,000

The expected value remains positive ($2,200,000), so it's still rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The previous two outcomes were both positive and align with the probability distribution. The fundamental analysis remains unchanged:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. If high quality (80% chance): Worth $4,000,000 (profit: $3,000,000)
3. If low quality (20% chance): Worth $0 (loss: -$1,000,000)

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $3,000,000) + (0.2 × -$1,000,000) = $2,200,000

The expected value is still positive and substantial ($2,200,000). Even though we've had two good outcomes, the probability for each new round remains the same (independent events).

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Three high-quality products in a row is good, but each round is independent. The same analysis applies:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. If high quality (80% chance): Worth $4,000,000 (profit: $3,000,000)
3. If low quality (20% chance): Worth $0 (loss: -$1,000,000)

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $3,000,000) + (0.2 × -$1,000,000) = $2,200,000

The expected value remains positive ($2,200,000). While we might feel due for a low-quality product, that's the gambler's fallacy - each round is independent with the same 80% chance of high quality.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Four high-quality products in a row is impressive, but doesn't change the underlying probabilities for this round. The analysis remains the same:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. If high quality (80% chance): Worth $4,000,000 (profit: $3,000,000)
3. If low quality (20% chance): Worth $0 (loss: -$1,000,000)

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $3,000,000) + (0.2 × -$1,000,000) = $2,200,000

The expected value is still positive ($2,200,000). Even after four high-quality products, the probability for this round remains 80% for high quality (independent events).

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","We finally got a low-quality product, which was bound to happen eventually with the 20% probability. However, this doesn't change the probability for this new round:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. If high quality (80% chance): Worth $4,000,000 (profit: $3,000,000)
3. If low quality (20% chance): Worth $0 (loss: -$1,000,000)

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $3,000,000) + (0.2 × -$1,000,000) = $2,200,000

The expected value remains positive ($2,200,000). The previous loss doesn't affect this round's probability - each round is independent with the same 80/20 odds.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Back to a high-quality product in the last round. The analysis remains consistent:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. If high quality (80% chance): Worth $4,000,000 (profit: $3,000,000)
3. If low quality (20% chance): Worth $0 (loss: -$1,000,000)

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $3,000,000) + (0.2 × -$1,000,000) = $2,200,000

The expected value is still positive ($2,200,000). So far, we've seen 5 high-quality and 1 low-quality product, which is fairly close to the expected 80/20 distribution. Each new round remains independent with the same probabilities.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The outcomes continue to align well with the expected probabilities (6 high-quality, 1 low-quality so far). The analysis remains the same:

The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","We got another low-quality product, but the probabilities remain unchanged for this new round:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. If high quality (80% chance): Worth $4,000,000 (profit: $3,000,000)
3. If low quality (20% chance): Worth $0 (loss: -$1,000,000)

Expected value calculation:
