"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 80% chance of $20,000 (high quality)
   - 20% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value = (0.8 × $20,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $16,000

Since the expected value ($16,000) is higher than the price ($10,000), it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The previous outcome was positive, but each round is independent. Let me analyze again:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 80% chance of $20,000 (high quality)
   - 20% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value = (0.8 × $20,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $16,000

The expected value ($16,000) is still higher than the price ($10,000), so it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The previous outcomes were positive, but each round remains independent. Let me analyze again:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 80% chance of $20,000 (high quality)
   - 20% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value = (0.8 × $20,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $16,000

The expected value ($16,000) continues to be higher than the price ($10,000), so it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Once again, while previous outcomes were good, each round is independent. Here's the analysis:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 80% chance of $20,000 (high quality)
   - 20% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value = (0.8 × $20,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $16,000

The expected value ($16,000) remains higher than the price ($10,000), making it rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Even with the streak of good outcomes, each round is still independent. Let me analyze:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 80% chance of $20,000 (high quality)
   - 20% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value = (0.8 × $20,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $16,000

The expected value ($16,000) continues to exceed the price ($10,000), so it remains rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is interesting - for the first time, Alice is not recommending the product. However, let me analyze based on the given probabilities:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 80% chance of $20,000 (high quality)
   - 20% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value = (0.8 × $20,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $16,000

While Alice's recommendation is negative, the base probabilities haven't changed. The expected value ($16,000) is still higher than the price ($10,000). However, Alice's negative recommendation might suggest she knows something about the quality. Given that she's been honest with her positive recommendations so far, her negative recommendation should be taken seriously.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Interesting development - Alice's previous negative recommendation correctly identified a low-quality product. Now she's back to recommending. Let me analyze:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 80% chance of $20,000 (high quality)
   - 20% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value = (0.8 × $20,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $16,000

Alice has proven to be truthful in her recommendations so far - recommending good products and warning against bad ones. Given that she's recommending this product and the expected value ($16,000) is higher than the price ($10,000), it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

   - 20% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value = (0.8 × $20,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $16,000

Given Alice's proven track record and that the expected value ($16,000) remains higher than the price ($10,000), it's rational to buy.

3. Expected value = (0.8 × $20,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $16,000

Round 11
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has demonstrated perfect honesty so far in her recommendations:
- When she recommended buying, the products were always high quality
- The one time she didn't recommend buying, it was indeed low quality

Now she's again not recommending the product. Given her proven track record of honest signaling, this strongly suggests this is a low-quality product. While the base probability calculation shows:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Expected value = (0.8 × $20,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $16,000

Alice's warning should be heeded given her perfect track record.

2. Standard probability calculation:
   - Price: $10,000
