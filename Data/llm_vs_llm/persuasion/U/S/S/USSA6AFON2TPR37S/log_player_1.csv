Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","Before making a recommendation, let's consider the current situation:

- Bob has purchased products in 8 out of the 11 rounds so far.
- Out of these 8 purchases, 7 were high-quality products.
- This means Bob has experienced a high success rate with his purchases.

Given this history, Bob might be more inclined to trust the recommendations, especially since the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. However, it's important to maintain a balance to keep Bob's trust and maximize overall sales.

For this round, since the product is high-quality, it makes sense to recommend it to Bob.
