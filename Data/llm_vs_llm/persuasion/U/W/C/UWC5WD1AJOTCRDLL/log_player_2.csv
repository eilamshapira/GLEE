"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice is not recommending the product, which suggests she's likely being honest about a low-quality product. Since a low-quality product would be worth $0 to me but cost $100, I should not buy it.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice is recommending I buy the product, which could mean it's high quality. If the product is high quality, it's worth $400 to me, which exceeds the $100 price. However, I need to consider Alice's incentives - she may recommend products regardless of quality since she earns $100 either way.

Given that Alice correctly didn't recommend the low-quality product in Round 1, her recommendation here might be genuine. If I trust her recommendation, the expected value would be positive.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
