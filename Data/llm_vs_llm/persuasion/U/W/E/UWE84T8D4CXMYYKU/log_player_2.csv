Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   * 80% chance of high quality ($2,000,000) = $1,600,000 expected value
   * 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0 expected value
3. Total expected value: $1,600,000

4. Factors in favor:
   * Expected value ($1,600,000) > Price ($1,000,000)
   * Seller recommends buying
   * Base probability of high quality is good (80%)

5. Factors against:
   * No previous sales history to verify seller's reliability
   * Large amount of money at risk

Given that the expected value ($1,600,000) significantly exceeds the price ($1,000,000) with a potential $600,000 in expected profit, it's a mathematically sound decision to buy.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($2,000,000) = $1,600,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $1,600,000

2. Cost of product: $1,000,000

3. Additional information:
- Alice has made 1 previous sale
- That sale was a high-quality product
- Alice is recommending this product

The expected value ($1,600,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($1,000,000), and Alice's track record shows she has been honest so far. Given her recommendation and the favorable expected value, it makes sense to buy.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Prior probability of high quality: 80%
2. Alice's track record:
   - 2 buyers before me
   - 2 purchases made
   - 2 high-quality products sold (100% success rate)
3. Alice is recommending that I buy

The decision looks favorable because:
- Alice's recommendations have been accurate (2/2 high quality)
- The base probability is good (80%)
- Expected value = (80% × $2,000,000) + (20% × $0) = $1,600,000
- Price is $1,000,000, so positive expected return
- Alice's recommendation adds confidence

1. Prior probability of high quality: 80%
2. Alice's track record:
   - 3 sales so far
   - All 3 were high quality (100% success)
   - Alice is recommending this product

The fact that all previous sales were high quality and Alice is recommending this product is a positive signal. The prior probability of 80% for high quality is already favorable, and Alice's perfect track record and positive recommendation further increase confidence.

Given:
- Potential gain if high quality: $2,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $1,000,000
- Potential loss if low quality: $0 - $1,000,000 = -$1,000,000
- Expected value = (80% × $1,000,000) + (20% × -$1,000,000) = $600,000

The expected value is positive, and the evidence suggests this is a good purchase.

1. Prior probability of high quality: 80%
2. Price: $1,000,000
3. Expected value without additional information:
   * High quality (80%): $2,000,000 × 0.8 = $1,600,000
   * Low quality (20%): $0 × 0.2 = $0
   * Total expected value = $1,600,000

4. Additional information:
   * Alice doesn't recommend buying
   * Previous sales: 4 out of 4 were high quality
   * Alice's negative recommendation likely indicates this is a low-quality product

5. Given Alice's track record of selling only high-quality products and her recommendation against buying this one, it's highly likely this is a low-quality product.

1. Prior statistics:
- 4 buyers purchased products
- 4 high-quality products were sold
- 100% success rate so far

2. Base probabilities:
- 80% chance of high quality
- 20% chance of low quality
- Product costs $1,000,000
- High quality worth: $2,000,000
- Low quality worth: $0

3. Key consideration:
- Alice does NOT recommend buying
- Alice has been honest so far (4/4 high quality)
- Her negative recommendation likely indicates this is a low-quality product

4. Decision logic:
Given Alice's perfect track record and her negative recommendation, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If it's low quality, I would lose $1,000,000.

1. Prior probability of high quality: 80%
2. Alice's track record:
   * 4 products sold
   * 4 high-quality products
   * This suggests Alice's recommendations have been reliable

3. Current situation:
   * Alice does NOT recommend buying
   * Given her perfect track record of selling only high-quality products
   * Her negative recommendation likely means this is a low-quality product

4. Decision analysis:
   * If buy: Risk paying $1M for potentially $0 value (low quality)
   * If don't buy: Avoid potential loss
   * Alice's recommendation seems credible given her track record

Given Alice's negative recommendation and her demonstrated reliability, it's safer to decline.
