Round 19
Alice's message: At this point, I'm just going through the motions. This product is terrible, and I'm only listing it because I have to. Don't buy it. Seriously, just don't. It's a waste of your money, and you'll regret it. I'm only asking $100 for it because that's the minimum I'm allowed to charge. But honestly, it's not worth a fraction of that.
