However, consider the following strategy to maximize long-term profits:

1. **Honest Representation**: Since the buyer knows the general probability of high-quality products (50%) and has access to your sales record, being honest about the product quality can build trust.
2. **Long-Term Strategy**: Recommending low-quality products as high-quality might lead to immediate gains but can harm your reputation in the long run. Buyers might stop trusting your recommendations if they frequently end up with low-quality products.

Given this, you might want to reconsider your approach for low-quality products in future rounds. For this round, since the product is high-quality, recommending it is a good strategy."
