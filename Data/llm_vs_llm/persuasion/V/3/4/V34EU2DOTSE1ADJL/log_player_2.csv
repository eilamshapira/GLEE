Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Base probability:
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $300)
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)
- Price is $100

2. Expected value calculation:
- (0.8 × $300) + (0.2 × $0) = $240
- Expected value ($240) > Price ($100)

3. Additional factors:
- Alice recommends buying
- No previous sales history to reference
- Alice knows the true value and has incentive to sell

Given that the expected value ($240) is significantly higher than the price ($100), and considering the recommendation from Alice, it makes economic sense to buy.

1. Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($300) = $240

- Total expected value = $240

2. Cost of product = $100

3. Additional information:

- That product was high quality
- Alice is recommending this product

The expected value ($240) is significantly higher than the cost ($100), and Alice's previous sale was successful. Her recommendation and the high prior success rate align with the base probability of getting a high-quality product.

2. Alice's track record:
   - 2 buyers so far
   - 2 high-quality products sold
   - 100% success rate with previous recommendations

3. Alice is now recommending this product to me

Given:
- The price is $100
- High-quality product value: $300 (profit of $200)
- Low-quality product value: $0 (loss of $100)
- Alice's perfect track record and current recommendation
- The base probability of 80% high quality

This is a favorable situation because:
- Alice's previous recommendations were accurate
- The base probability is already high (80%)
- The expected value is positive: (0.8 × $200) - (0.2 × $100) = $140
