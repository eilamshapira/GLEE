Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   * High quality (33.33%): $30,000
   * Low quality (66.67%): $0

Expected value = (0.3333 × $30,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $10,000

The expected value equals the price, but:
1. Alice recommends buying
2. As first buyer, no track record to verify Alice's credibility
3. Risk of losing entire $10,000 is high (66.67% chance)

Given the high risk and no historical data to trust Alice's recommendation, it's safer to decline.

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33%): $30,000
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0

Expected value calculation:
(33.33% × $30,000) + (66.67% × $0) = $10,000

The expected value equals the price, making this a neutral expected value proposition. However, Alice's recommendation to buy provides a potentially positive signal, even though we don't have any historical data to validate her trustworthiness.

Given that there's at least some positive indication from the seller and the neutral expected value, I'll take the chance.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product costs $10,000
2. There's a 33.33% chance of high quality (worth $30,000)
3. There's a 66.67% chance of low quality (worth $0)
4. Alice has dealt with 1 previous buyer
5. 0 high-quality products have been sold
6. Alice recommends buying

This is concerning because:
- The previous sale resulted in no high-quality products
- Even though Alice recommends buying, her track record doesn't inspire confidence
- The expected value calculation: (0.3333 × $30,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $10,000

The expected value equals the cost, but given the negative track record and high risk, it's safer to decline.

4. Alice recommends buying, but:

2. Potential value:

Red flags:

0.6667 × $0 = $0 (worst case)
Average expected value: $10,000

The expected value equals the cost, but the previous sales data (0 high-quality products) suggests the actual probability of getting a high-quality product might be lower than the theoretical 33.33%.
