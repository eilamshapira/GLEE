Would you like to buy the current product?","To make a decision, let's consider the expected value of the product:

- Probability the product is high-quality = 80% (Alice's stated probability)
- Value of high-quality product = $30,000
- Cost of purchase = $10,000
- Probability the product is low-quality = 20%
- Value of low-quality product = $0

Expected value = (Probability high-quality * Value high-quality) + (Probability low-quality * Value low-quality) - Cost 

Expected value = (0.8 * $30,000) + (0.2 * $0) - $10,000
Expected value = $24,000 - $10,000
Expected value = $14,000

Based on the expected value being positive, the decision is to buy the product.
