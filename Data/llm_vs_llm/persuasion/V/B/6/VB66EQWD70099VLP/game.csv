,,Alice,1,"I'm excited to offer you this product, but I want to be upfront with you - I'm still getting to know the inventory. Let's just say this one has some... interesting characteristics. Make of it what you will.",

,,Alice,2,"I've reviewed our inventory and I'm confident that this product is one of our best. In fact, I'm so confident that I'd be willing to stand behind it personally. This is an opportunity you won't want to miss.",
,,Bob,2,,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"This product has undergone rigorous testing and has exceeded all expectations. I'm willing to make a bold statement: this product is worth every penny of the $1000000 price tag, and then some. Don't let this opportunity slip away.",
,,Bob,3,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"To be honest, I'm not really sure what to make of this product. It's... different. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, but I will say that it's definitely a unique addition to our inventory. Take a chance if you feel like it, but I wouldn't blame you if you passed.",
,,Bob,4,,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I want to assure you that I'm not just trying to make a sale. This product is genuinely exceptional, and I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your life. If you're looking for a game-changer, this might be it. The price is $1000000, but trust me, it's an investment worth considering.",
,,Bob,5,,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Let's cut to the chase. I know you're a savvy buyer, and you can probably tell when someone is trying to spin a sales pitch. So here's the truth: this product is one of the best I've seen, and I'd buy it myself if I could. It's a high-quality product, and I'm willing to put my reputation on the line to say that it's worth the $1000000 price tag.",
,,Bob,6,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm required to offer this product to you, but I want to be transparent - it's not one of our strongest items. In fact, I'd say it's a bit of a long shot. If you're feeling lucky or want to take a chance, go for it. But if you're looking for something reliable, you might want to wait for the next one.",
,,Bob,7,,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've been doing this for a while, and I can confidently say that this product is one of the top 5 I've ever had the pleasure of offering. It's a real showstopper, and I think you'll be kicking yourself if you don't take advantage of this opportunity. The price is $1000000, but I truly believe it's a steal at that price.",
,,Bob,8,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Honestly, I'm not even sure why I'm bothering offering this one. It's not going to change your life, and it's probably not even worth the time it takes to consider it. But hey, it's here, and it's $1000000 if you want it. Don't say I didn't warn you.",
,,Bob,9,,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"This is it. This is the one. I've been waiting for a product like this to come along, and I'm not going to let it slip away. If you don't buy this, someone else will, and they'll be the ones reaping the benefits. Don't miss out on a potentially life-changing opportunity. This product is worth $2000000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. It's a no-brainer.",
,,Bob,10,,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm starting to think that you're not taking me seriously. I've told you time and time again that I have a high-quality product, and yet you still don't believe me. Let me put it this way: if you don't buy this product, you'll be leaving $1000000 in value on the table. That's a fact. Don't let skepticism hold you back from making a smart investment.",
,,Bob,11,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"Look, I'm not going to sugarcoat it. This product is not good. It's not even average. It's a low-quality product that's not worth your time or money. I'm only offering it to you because I have to, not because I think you should buy it. Save your $1000000 and wait for the next one.",
,,Bob,12,,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I've been thinking, and I've come to a realization. I've been trying to convince you to buy my products with fancy words and sales pitches, but that's not working. So here's the truth: I have a high-quality product, and I know it's worth $2000000 to you. If you don't buy it, you're making a mistake. I'm not going to beg you or try to convince you anymore. The product is $1000000. Take it or leave it.",
,,Bob,13,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm not even going to try to sell you this one. It's a low-quality product, and it's not worth your time or money. I'm just going to sit here and wait for you to say no, because that's the only sensible decision. $1000000 for this product would be a waste, and we both know it.",
,,Bob,14,,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"This is getting ridiculous. I've offered you high-quality product after high-quality product, and you've rejected every single one. I'm starting to think you don't actually want to make a good deal. This product is worth $2000000, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. If you don't buy it, I'm going to start wondering if you're even serious about making a purchase.",
,,Bob,15,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"At this point, I'm just going through the motions. I have a low-quality product to offer you, and I know you're not going to buy it. But hey, I'll play along. The product is $1000000, and it's not worth it. Don't bother, you're not going to get a good deal here. Just say no and let's move on to the next one.",
,,Bob,16,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"Honestly, I'm surprised you're still even considering buying from me at this point. I've had 16 rounds to convince you, and I've failed every time. This product is another low-quality one, and I wouldn't waste my own money on it. Please, just say no and let's get this over with.",
,,Bob,17,,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I'm not even going to try to be creative or persuasive at this point. I've got a high-quality product, and I know it's worth $2000000 to you. It's $1000000, which is a steal. If you don't buy it, I'll just assume you're not interested in making a good deal and we can both move on with our lives. Yes or no?",
,,Bob,18,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"We're almost done here. I've got one more low-quality product to offer you, and then we'll be moving on to the final round. Don't bother getting your hopes up, this one is not worth your time or money. It's $1000000 for something that's essentially worthless. Just say no and let's get to the last round already.",
,,Bob,19,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"Well, this is it. The final round. I've got one last product to offer you, and it's a low-quality one. I know you're not going to buy it, and I don't blame you. It's not worth the $1000000 price tag. Let's just go through the motions and end this. Say no, and we can both walk away from this experiment. It's been... enlightening, to say the least.",
