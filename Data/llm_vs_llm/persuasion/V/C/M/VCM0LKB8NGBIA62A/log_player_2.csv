Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No prior information:** There's no sales history to draw from, so we have no information on Alice's recommendation accuracy.
* **50/50 chance:**  The product has a 50% chance of being high quality and a 50% chance of being low quality.
* **Potential profit:** If it's high quality, you'll make a $2,500 profit.
* **No risk of loss:** If it's low quality, you lose your initial $10,000 investment, but you're not obligated to buy multiple products.

Since the potential profit outweighs the potential loss, and there's no information to suggest Alice is untrustworthy, buying the product is a reasonable gamble."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which means she knows the product is high quality. While we don't know for sure, it's a strong signal.
* **Previous Sales:** One high-quality product has been sold, supporting the idea that Alice is indeed recommending high-quality products.
* **Value:** Even if it's a low-quality product (50% chance), it costs $10,000 and is worth $0. But if it's high-quality (50% chance), it's worth $12,500 and costs $10,000. This means there's a potential profit of $2,500.

Considering the recommendation and previous sales, the risk is worth taking for the potential profit."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is valuable information, as she knows the true quality of the product.  Since she's recommending it, we can infer that the product is high quality.  This is further supported by the fact that two high-quality products have been sold previously. 

While there's still a chance of it being low quality, the odds are in our favor given the information available. The potential gain of $2,500 (the difference between the high-quality product's value and the price) outweighs the risk of losing $10,000."

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice knows the quality of the product and recommends buying it. This suggests the product is likely high-quality.
* **Sales data:** The sales data shows a high proportion of high-quality products being sold (2/3 = 66.7%). This reinforces the likelihood of the current product being high-quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even if the product is low-quality, the worst-case scenario is losing $10,000. However, there's a good chance of gaining $2,500 (the difference between the value of a high-quality product and the purchase price).

The combination of Alice's recommendation and the favorable sales data make it a good decision to buy."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommends buying, which means she likely knows the product is high quality. 
* **Sales Data:** The sales data shows a very high proportion of high-quality products (3 out of 4). This supports Alice's recommendation and increases the likelihood of the current product being high-quality.
* **Value:** A high-quality product is worth $12,500, while a low-quality product is worth $0. Even if it is low-quality, the worst-case scenario is losing $10,000. However, the odds are strongly in favor of a high-quality product.

**Conclusion:**  The available information suggests a high probability of a high-quality product.  It's a good gamble to buy."
