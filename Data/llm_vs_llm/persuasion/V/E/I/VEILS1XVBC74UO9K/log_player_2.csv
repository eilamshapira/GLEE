Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the provided statistics:
- 5 high-quality products have been sold.
- 5 buyers have purchased products, which implies each purchased product was high quality.
- Alice recommends buying the current product.

Given these insights, there seems to be a pattern where Alice recommends products that turn out to be high quality. Therefore, it seems reasonable to trust Alice's recommendation for this product as well.

"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 6 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 6 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 7th buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To determine whether you should buy the product, consider the following:

1. Alice's recommendations have resulted in 6 purchases, all of which were high-quality products. This implies that Alice's recommendation aligns strongly with the product being high quality.
2. The prior probability of a product being high quality is 33.33%, but Alice's recommendation seems to significantly increase this probability based on past outcomes.
3. The expected value from buying:
   - If high quality: $40,000 (value) - $10,000 (price) = $30,000 (gain)
   - If low quality: $0 (value) - $10,000 (price) = -$10,000 (loss)

Given this information and Alice's recommendation, the probability of the product being high quality given Alice's recommendation appears to be very high. Therefore, you should consider buying the product.
