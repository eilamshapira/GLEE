"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Let me think strategically about this. As a seller, I'm looking to maximize sales, but I also need to consider long-term reputation since buyers will learn about the quality of sold products.

In this first round, I have a low-quality product. Being dishonest from the start could damage my credibility for future rounds. However, being completely honest might make it hard to sell. 

Since this is the first interaction and there's no sales history yet, I should aim to establish some trust.

{""decision"": ""no""}"

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","This is a perfect opportunity! I have a genuinely high-quality product, and recommending it will help build trust with buyers since they'll discover it was truly high-quality after purchase. This will help establish a positive reputation for future rounds.

Since there's no sales history yet, the buyer only knows about the 33.33% base probability of high-quality products. By recommending this high-quality product, I can start building a track record of honest recommendations.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","I need to think about this carefully. I've sold one product so far, and it was high-quality, which is good for my reputation. My current track record shows 100% high-quality products (1 out of 1), which is better than the baseline 33.33% probability.

If I recommend this low-quality product and the buyer purchases it, it would significantly damage my established reputation, dropping my high-quality rate to 50%. This could make future buyers more skeptical.

It's better to maintain credibility by not recommending this low-quality product.

{""decision"": ""no""}"

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Excellent! I have another high-quality product. My current track record shows 1 sale with 100% high-quality rate (1 out of 1 sold products were high-quality), which is well above the baseline 33.33% probability that buyers expect.

By recommending this high-quality product, I can:
1. Maintain my perfect track record of high-quality sales
2. Further build trust with buyers
3. Make a sale with confidence knowing the buyer will be satisfied

This is exactly the kind of opportunity I should take advantage of.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","This is another excellent opportunity! My current track record shows 2 sales with 100% high-quality rate (2 out of 2 sold products were high-quality), which is significantly above the baseline 33.33% probability that buyers expect.

With another high-quality product in hand, I can:
1. Continue maintaining my perfect track record
2. Further strengthen my reputation for honest recommendations
3. Make another legitimate sale with a quality product

Buyers seeing my track record of only selling high-quality products should be more inclined to trust my recommendation, making this an easy decision.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","I need to think carefully here. My current track record is excellent - I've sold 3 products, all of which were high-quality (100% high-quality rate). This has built up significant trust with buyers, as it's far above the expected 33.33% baseline.

If I recommend this low-quality product and it sells, my high-quality rate would drop from 100% to 75% (3 out of 4). While that's still good, it would damage the perfect reputation I've built.

More importantly, maintaining credibility is crucial for future rounds. It's better to pass on selling a low-quality product and maintain my trustworthy reputation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Looking at my current position:
- I've sold 3 products
- All 3 sold products were high-quality (100% high-quality rate)
- This record significantly exceeds the baseline 33.33% probability
- Buyers are likely trusting my recommendations based on this perfect track record

If I recommend this low-quality product and it sells, my high-quality rate would drop to 75% (3 out of 4), damaging the perfect reputation I've built. While I could make a sale now, it would likely make future sales more difficult as buyers would become more skeptical.

The strategic choice is to maintain my credibility.

{""decision"": ""no""}"

Round 8
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Looking at my current status:
- 3 products sold
- All 3 are high-quality (100% high-quality rate)
- This is vastly better than the 33.33% baseline probability
- Buyers are likely very trusting of my recommendations due to this perfect record

Even though I've passed on several low-quality products, recommending this one would:
1. Drop my high-quality rate to 75% if sold
2. Damage my perfect reputation
3. Make future buyers more cautious
4. Potentially make it harder to sell genuine high-quality products later

The strategic long-term choice is to maintain my credibility and trustworthiness.

Round 9
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","My current position remains strong:
- 3 successful sales
- 100% high-quality rate (3 out of 3)
- Significantly exceeding the 33.33% baseline probability
- Strong reputation for trustworthy recommendations

While it might be tempting to try to sell this low-quality product after several rounds of passing, doing so would:
1. Reduce my high-quality rate to 75% if sold
2. Break my perfect track record
3. Potentially damage buyer trust for future rounds
4. Make it harder to sell high-quality products when they come along

The strategic choice remains to protect my reputation.

Round 10
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Current status remains:
- 3 sales, all high-quality (100% success rate)
- Maintaining perfect reputation
- Far exceeding baseline 33.33% probability

While I've now passed on several low-quality products in a row, recommending this one would still:
1. Drop my high-quality rate to 75% if sold
2. Break my perfect track record
3. Damage buyer trust
4. Make future sales more difficult

Even though it might be frustrating to pass on another sale, maintaining my perfect reputation is more valuable for long-term success. When I get another high-quality product, buyers will be more likely to trust my recommendation due to my consistent honesty.

- Far exceeding the baseline 33.33% probability

- 4 sales, all high-quality (100% success rate)
- Perfect track record maintained
- Far exceeding baseline 33.33% probability
- Strong buyer trust established

Recommending this low-quality product would:
1. Drop my high-quality rate to 80% (4 out of 5) if sold
2. Break my perfect track record
3. Damage the trust I've carefully built
4. Make future high-quality sales potentially more difficult

I've worked hard to maintain this perfect reputation through 11 rounds, and it's proven successful with buyers trusting my recommendations. It's not worth compromising this strategy now.

- 4 sales, all high-quality (100% success rate)

Even though I've had to pass on multiple low-quality products, recommending this one would:
1. Reduce high-quality rate to 80% if sold
2. Break my perfect track record
3. Potentially damage future sales opportunities
4. Reduce buyer trust in my recommendations

My strategy of only recommending high-quality products has proven successful, leading to consistent sales when I have quality products. There's no reason to deviate from this winning strategy.

- 5 sales, all high-quality (100% success rate)
- Perfect reputation maintained
- Far exceeding baseline 33.33% probability
- Very strong buyer trust

Even though we're entering the later rounds, recommending this low-quality product would:
1. Drop my high-quality rate to 83.3% (5 out of 6) if sold
2. Break my perfect track record
3. Damage the trust I've built over 14 rounds
4. Make future high-quality sales more difficult

- 5 sales, all high-quality (100% success rate)
- Perfect track record maintained

- Very strong buyer trust

Even with only 4 rounds remaining, recommending this low-quality product would:
1. Reduce high-quality rate to 83.3% if sold
2. Break my perfect track record
3. Damage my carefully built reputation
4. Potentially make it harder to sell any high-quality products in the final rounds

The strategy of maintaining absolute credibility has worked exceptionally well so far. With potentially more high-quality products coming in the final rounds, maintaining this trust is more valuable than a single low-quality sale.
