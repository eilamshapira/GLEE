Let me explain briefly without revealing too many internal details: Although individually each product is high‐quality with a 33.33% baseline chance, Alice’s recommendations are derived after seeing the product’s true quality. In equilibrium her recommendation would be somewhat “polluted” by occasionally recommending low‐quality products. Here, the sales record shows that among the three products sold (despite her recommending purchase) only two turned out high‐quality. That gives you a roughly 66.67% chance that this product is high quality—well below the ≈83.33% threshold needed to make buying worthwhile (since a high‐quality product gives you a net gain of $2,000 but a low‐quality product would cost you $10,000). 

Thus, given the current recommendation and the record, your rational decision is not to buy the product."
