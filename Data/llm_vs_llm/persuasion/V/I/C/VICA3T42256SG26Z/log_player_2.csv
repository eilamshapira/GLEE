Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50% chance): $1,250,000
   - Low quality (50% chance): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (50% × $1,250,000) + (50% × $0) = $625,000

4. Alice's recommendation: Positive
   - However, as a seller, she has an incentive to sell regardless of quality
   - With no previous sales history, we can't evaluate her trustworthiness

5. Risk assessment:
   - 50% chance of losing entire $1,000,000 investment
   - Even with high quality, profit margin is only $250,000
   - Expected value ($625,000) is less than price ($1,000,000)

Given that the expected value is significantly below the asking price, and there's no historical data to trust the seller's recommendation, it would be too risky to buy.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The baseline expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of high quality ($1,250,000) = $625,000
- 50% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $625,000
- Price = $1,000,000

2. Additional information:
- Alice doesn't recommend buying
- No prior sales history to reference
- Alice knows the true quality and is giving a negative recommendation

3. Decision reasoning:
Given that Alice is providing a negative recommendation and she knows the true quality, this suggests the product is more likely to be low quality. The expected value would therefore be lower than the baseline $625,000, making it well below the asking price of $1,000,000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 50% chance of $1,250,000 (profit of $250,000)
   - 50% chance of $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
3. Expected value without additional information = $625,000 - $1,000,000 = -$375,000
4. Alice doesn't recommend buying
5. Since Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend it, this likely indicates it's a low-quality product

Given Alice's negative recommendation and the expected negative value, it would be risky to buy.

   - 50% chance of $1,250,000 (profit of $250,000)
   - 50% chance of $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $1,250,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $625,000
4. Alice does NOT recommend buying
5. No prior sales history to reference

Given that:
- The expected value ($625,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000)
- The seller explicitly recommends against buying
- There's no historical data to provide additional context
- The potential loss ($1,000,000) is significantly larger than the potential gain ($250,000)

It would be prudent to follow the seller's recommendation and not buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. No prior sales data exists, so I can't use historical information
2. Base probability is 50% high quality, 50% low quality
3. The seller does not recommend buying
4. Expected value calculation:
   * 50% chance of $1,250,000 = $625,000
   * 50% chance of $0 = $0
   * Total expected value = $625,000
5. Cost is $1,000,000
6. Expected value ($625,000) < Cost ($1,000,000)
7. The seller's negative recommendation further suggests caution

Given that the expected value is less than the cost, and the seller's recommendation is negative, it would not be rational to buy.
