Explanation: Given the probabilities and payoffs, the expected value of buying a product is (0.3333 * $12,000) + (0.6667 * $0) = $4,000. Since the purchase price is $10,000, which is higher than the expected value, the optimal decision is to decline the purchase in each round."

Just a quick question: Is it possible for me to negotiate the price with Alice, instead of accepting or refusing the fixed price of $10,000?
