"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $100
2. If high quality (80% chance): Worth $125 (profit of $25)
3. If low quality (20% chance): Worth $0 (loss of $100)

Expected value calculation:
* (0.80 × $125) + (0.20 × $0) = $100
* Average value = $100, which equals the price

Since Alice knows the true quality and is recommending to buy, and this is the first round where establishing trust could be important, I'll accept the recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice was honest in Round 1, recommending a high-quality product. Now she's explicitly recommending NOT to buy the product. 

Given that:
1. Alice has proven honest in the first round
2. She has access to the true quality information
3. She's explicitly warning against purchase
4. She gains nothing by preventing a sale

This strongly suggests the product is low quality, and she's trying to prevent me from making a bad purchase. I should trust her negative recommendation.
