Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes""}

Explanation:
Given the high probability (80%) of the product being high-quality, the expected value of the product is:
\( 0.8 \times 3,000,000 + 0.2 \times 0 = 2,400,000 \)
Since the expected value (2,400,000) is greater than the cost (1,000,000), it makes sense to buy the product."
