Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (80% chance): $12,500
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $12,500) + (0.2 × $0) = $10,000

3. Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
4. Previous sales: 1 buyer, 1 high-quality product sold
5. Alice's recommendation: Positive

The fact that the previous sale was a high-quality product and Alice is recommending this product are both positive signals. The expected value calculation:
