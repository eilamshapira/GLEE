Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (80% chance): $12,500
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $12,500) + (0.2 × $0) = $10,000

The expected value equals the price, and Alice is recommending the purchase. While there's no track record to base additional trust on, the base probability makes this a fair deal with potential upside.

   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

3. Expected value calculation:

4. Additional information:
   - Previous buyer bought and got a high-quality product
   - Alice recommends buying
   - Past success supports Alice's credibility

The expected value equals the price, and we have positive signals:
- Historical success (1/1 high quality)
- Seller's recommendation
- High baseline probability of good quality (80%)

Given these factors, especially the positive track record and seller's recommendation, I'll take the offer.

- Total expected value: $10,000

3. Track record:
- 2 buyers so far
- 2 high-quality products sold
- 100% success rate
- Alice's recommendations have been accurate

4. Price:
- Fixed price: $10,000
- Expected value equals the price

5. Alice's recommendation:

3. Value if high quality: $12,500 (profit of $2,500)
4. Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $10,000)
5. Track record: 4 out of 4 sales were high quality (100%)
6. Alice is recommending to buy

The perfect track record and Alice's recommendation align with the high base probability of good products (80%). Given that:

- Expected value = (80% × $12,500) + (20% × $0) = $10,000
- With the positive track record and recommendation, the probability of high quality might be even higher than 80%
- This makes the expected value higher than $10,000

Since the expected value equals or exceeds the price, and all previous sales were successful, this seems like a good purchase.
