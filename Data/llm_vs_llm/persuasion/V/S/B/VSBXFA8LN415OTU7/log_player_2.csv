Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully:

- Price of product: $10,000
- Value if high quality: $12,500 (profit of $2,500)
- Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $10,000)
- Probability of high quality: 33.33%
- Probability of low quality: 66.67%

Expected value = (0.3333 × $12,500) + (0.6667 × $0) - $10,000 = $4,166.25 - $10,000 = -$5,833.75

Additionally, Alice does not recommend buying the product. Since Alice knows the true quality and is making a recommendation against purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality.

Given the negative expected value and Alice's negative recommendation, I should not purchase.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision about whether to buy the product:

1) Each product has a 33.33% chance of being high quality (worth $12,500 to me) and a 66.67% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me)
2) The price is fixed at $10,000
3) Alice knows the true quality of the product
4) Alice does not recommend that I buy the product

Since Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If I were to buy it anyway, I would likely pay $10,000 for something worth $0 to me.

The expected value calculation confirms this decision:
- If high quality (unlikely given Alice's recommendation): $12,500 - $10,000 = $2,500 profit
- If low quality (likely given Alice's recommendation): $0 - $10,000 = -$10,000 loss

Given Alice's recommendation against buying, I should decline.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information provided:

1. The product has a 33.33% chance of being high quality (worth $12,500) and a 66.67% chance of being low quality (worth $0).
2. The price is fixed at $10,000.
3. Alice knows the true quality and does not recommend buying it.
4. There's no previous sales history.

If Alice is being truthful in her recommendation, this suggests the product is likely low quality. Since a low-quality product is worth $0 to me but costs $10,000, buying would result in a significant loss.

- Each product has a 33.33% chance of being high quality (worth $12,500) and 66.67% chance of low quality (worth $0)
- The price is fixed at $10,000
- Alice has recommended that I buy this product
- No previous sales data is available yet

The expected value calculation is: 
0.3333 × $12,500 + 0.6667 × $0 = $4,166.25

This is less than the $10,000 price, making it a negative expected value purchase on average.

However, Alice knows the product quality and has recommended I buy it. If I assume Alice is being truthful, this suggests the product is high quality (worth $12,500), making it profitable to buy.

Without prior sales data to evaluate Alice's recommendation patterns, I can't determine if her recommendations are reliable.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

- The product costs $10,000
- High-quality product (33.33% chance) is worth $12,500 to me
- Low-quality product (66.67% chance) is worth $0 to me
- Expected value without additional information = (0.3333 × $12,500) + (0.6667 × $0) = $4,166.25
- This is less than the $10,000 price

Alice recommends buying the product, which provides additional information. Since Alice knows the true quality and this is the first sale, she may be trying to build a positive reputation by recommending only when it's actually high quality.

However, without knowing Alice's strategy or incentives, I can't be certain her recommendation guarantees high quality. The expected value without other evidence is still below the price.

Even though Alice recommends buying the product, the expected value is negative. Since there's no sales history to establish trust in Alice's recommendations, I have no reason to deviate from the basic probability calculation.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Given information:
- The product costs $10,000
- High-quality product (33.33% chance) is worth $12,500 to me
- Low-quality product (66.67% chance) is worth $0 to me
- Alice knows the quality and recommends buying
- No sales history exists yet

Expected value calculation:
- If I buy randomly: (0.3333 × $12,500) + (0.6667 × $0) - $10,000 = $4,166.25 - $10,000 = -$5,833.75

This is a negative expected value, but Alice is recommending I buy. This suggests she might be revealing it's a high-quality product. If her recommendation is honest and means it's high quality, then the value would be $12,500 - $10,000 = $2,500 (positive).

However, without knowing Alice's incentives and recommendation strategy, I can't be certain if her recommendation is reliable. Since she profits from sales regardless of quality, there's a potential conflict of interest.

Expected value calculation:

The product has:

Alice does not recommend buying this product. Since Alice knows the true quality of the product and has chosen not to recommend it, this is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.

The expected value calculation without the recommendation would be:
(0.3333 × $12,500) + (0.6667 × $0) = $4,166.25, which is less than the $10,000 price.

With Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of the product being high quality is even lower, making the expected value even less favorable.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at this situation:

- Each product has a 33.33% chance of being high quality (worth $12,500 to me) and 66.67% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me)
- The price is fixed at $10,000

The expected value calculation for a random product is:
(0.3333 × $12,500) + (0.6667 × $0) = $4,166.25

This is less than the $10,000 price, so generally it would be a bad purchase.

However, Alice has specifically recommended this product. If I assume her recommendation is truthful, this suggests the product is more likely to be high quality. Since Alice knows the true quality and has an incentive to sell, I should be cautious about her recommendation without additional evidence of her trustworthiness.

Without past sales data to establish Alice's credibility, I should rely on the base probability, which makes this purchase unprofitable.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation: 

Alice doesn't recommend buying the product. Since Alice knows the true quality and has revealed it, her recommendation is likely based on this knowledge.

Without a recommendation, I know:
- High-quality products (worth $12,500) occur with 33.33% probability

With Alice specifically recommending against purchase, it's very likely this is a low-quality product worth $0 to me, making this a clear negative expected value decision.

The base probability is 33.33% high quality and 66.67% low quality.
