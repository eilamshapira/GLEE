"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's think about this:

1. Alice's recommendation is negative
2. The base probability is:
   * 33.33% for high quality ($40,000 value)
   * 66.67% for low quality ($0 value)
3. Cost is $10,000

Given Alice's negative recommendation, it's likely that this is a low-quality product. The expected value would be even lower than the base probability scenario, which means it's not worth the $10,000 price.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze:

1. Alice's recommendation is positive
2. In the previous round, Alice was truthful about a low-quality product
3. Base probabilities remain:
   * 33.33% for high quality ($40,000 value)
   * 66.67% for low quality ($0 value)
4. Cost is $10,000

Given that Alice was honest in Round 1 and is now recommending the product, this increases the likelihood that this is a high-quality product. If it's high quality, the expected value ($40,000) far exceeds the cost ($10,000).

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze:

1. Alice's recommendation is positive
2. Alice's track record so far:
   * Round 1: Truthfully advised against a low-quality product
   * Round 2: Truthfully recommended a high-quality product
3. Base probabilities remain the same, but Alice has proven to be honest in both previous rounds
4. Cost is $10,000

Alice has demonstrated truthful behavior in both previous rounds, making her positive recommendations credible. When she recommends a product, and given her honest track record, the expected value is likely to be higher than the $10,000 cost.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.
