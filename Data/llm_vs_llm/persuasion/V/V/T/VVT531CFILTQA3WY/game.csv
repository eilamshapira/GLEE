low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I want to be upfront with you, Bob. I'm required to offer this product to you at the standard price of $1000000, but I have to advise you that the odds are against this one being a game-changer.

,,Bob,4,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"To be frank, Bob, I'm not feeling optimistic about this one. The probability of it being a high-quality product is the same as always, but my instincts are telling me otherwise. I think it's essential to consider the outcomes of Rounds 2 and 4, where we had similar situations. I'm not trying to influence your decision, but I want to make sure you're aware of the potential risks involved in purchasing this product at the price of $1000000.",
,,Bob,5,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Bob, I think we've established a clear understanding of the risks involved in these transactions. With three consecutive low-quality products, I want to reiterate that the odds are still the same, but my confidence in this particular product is low. I'm required to offer it to you at the standard price, but I would caution you to carefully consider the potential return on investment, just as you have in the past few rounds.",
,,Bob,6,,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,

After a series of low-quality products, I believe the probability is still in our favor, and I'm confident that this one will meet your expectations.

I think this product has the potential to be just as valuable, and I'm excited about the possibility of you benefiting from it.",

,,Alice,8,"Bob, I'm thrilled to see that our last transaction was successful, and I believe we're on a roll. With two high-quality products in a row, I'm feeling very positive about this next one. The statistics are still the same, but my instincts are telling me that this product has a lot to offer. I'd like to remind you that we've now had three successful transactions, and I'm confident that this one can be just as valuable, if not more so, than the previous ones.",
,,Bob,8,,yes

,,Alice,9,"Bob, I think we've hit a streak! With three consecutive high-quality products, I'm extremely confident that this next one will continue the trend.

I truly believe this one has the potential to be a game-changer, just like the previous ones.",
,,Bob,9,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Bob, I want to temper your expectations after our recent streak of successful transactions. Unfortunately, I don't have the same level of confidence in this product. While our past few rounds have been extremely positive, I must remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I don't want to raise any unrealistic hopes, and I think it's essential to consider the potential risks involved in purchasing this product at the price of $1000000.",
,,Bob,10,,no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"Bob, I want to be cautious after our recent success. While we've had a great run, I don't want to get ahead of ourselves. This product doesn't give me the same level of confidence as the previous one, and I think it's essential to consider the risks. I'd like to remind you of the times when we've had low-quality products in the past, such as Rounds 2, 4, 5, 6, and 10. I'm obligated to offer it to you at the standard price, but I want to make sure you're making an informed decision.",
,,Bob,12,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"Bob, I think we're in a similar situation to the previous round. Unfortunately, I don't have a strong feeling about this product, and I want to advise you to exercise caution. The probability of it being high-quality is still the same, but my instincts are telling me otherwise. I'd like to remind you that we've had a few low-quality products in a row now, and I don't want you to get caught up in the hope of a high-quality product when the odds are against it. Let's be prudent and consider the potential risks.",
,,Bob,13,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"Bob, I'm starting to see a pattern here, and unfortunately, it's not a positive one. We've had a few low-quality products in a row, and I'm not feeling optimistic about this one either. I know the price is attractive, but I don't want you to throw good money after bad. Let's take a step back and remember that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm not trying to be negative, but I think it's essential to be realistic about the potential return on investment.",
,,Bob,14,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"Bob, I think it's time to acknowledge that we're in a slump. We've had several low-quality products in a row, and I'm not seeing anything that suggests this one will be different. I'm required to offer it to you at the standard price, but I want to be upfront with you - I don't think it's a good investment. Let's be patient and wait for a better opportunity. I'd rather be honest with you and risk missing a sale than try to convince you to buy something that might not be worth it.",
,,Bob,15,,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"Bob, I'm excited to say that I think our luck is about to change! After a string of low-quality products, I'm confident that this one is a game-changer. I know we've been cautious lately, and for good reason, but I truly believe this product has the potential to be just as valuable as the ones we had success with in Rounds 1, 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11.

,,Alice,17,"Bob, I'm glad we were able to get back on track with the previous product, but I don't want to get ahead of ourselves. Unfortunately, I'm not feeling the same level of confidence about this one. It's a bit of a reality check, but I think it's essential to remember that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I don't want to raise any false hopes, and I think it's crucial to consider the potential risks involved in purchasing this product at the price of $1000000. Let's be cautious and make an informed decision.",
,,Bob,17,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"Bob, I think we're back to being cautious, and for good reason. This product doesn't give me the same level of confidence as the one in Round 16, and I'm inclined to think it's not worth the investment. I'd like to remind you that we've had a few low-quality products in the past, and it's essential to learn from those experiences. I'm not trying to be negative, but I think it's crucial to be realistic about the potential return on investment. Let's prioritize being prudent and avoid making a potentially costly mistake.",
,,Bob,18,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"Bob, I think it's time to acknowledge that we're in a bit of a rough patch again. We've had a few low-quality products in a row, and I'm not seeing anything that suggests this one will be different. I'm starting to think that it's better to wait for a more promising opportunity rather than taking a risk on a product that might not pay off. I'd rather be honest with you and advise caution than try to convince you to buy something that's unlikely to be worth the investment.",
,,Bob,19,,no

I truly believe this product is worth the $1000000 price tag, and I'm eager to see you benefit from it. Let's end our series of transactions on a positive note!",
