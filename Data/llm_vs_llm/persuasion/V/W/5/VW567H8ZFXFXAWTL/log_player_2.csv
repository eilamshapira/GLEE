"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this game:

1) If I buy: 
   - 80% chance the product is worth $120, giving expected value of $96 (0.8 × $120)
   - 20% chance the product is worth $0, giving expected value of $0 (0.2 × $0)
   - Total expected value: $96
   - Cost: $100
   - Expected profit: -$4

2) If I don't buy:
   - Expected profit: $0

Alice knows the true quality, and she's recommending I buy it. However, the base expected value is negative, and Alice has an incentive to recommend purchase regardless of quality since she makes $100 either way.

In this first round, I don't have enough information about Alice's recommendation patterns, so I should make the mathematically sound decision.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $120 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Interesting. In the first round, Alice actually recommended a high-quality product, which suggests she might be giving honest recommendations.

Let me reconsider the situation:

1) Alice seems to be making truthful recommendations so far (though it's only one data point)
2) If she continues to be truthful, her recommendation indicates this is a high-quality product
3) If it's high-quality, my expected value is $120, for a profit of $20
4) If it's low-quality, my expected value is $0, for a loss of $100

Since Alice recommended truthfully in the first round and is recommending again, I'll take a chance that she's being honest.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $120 for you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has recommended two products so far, and both have been high quality. This suggests she may be giving honest recommendations, which would be valuable information for me as a buyer.

If Alice is truthful in her recommendations, then buying when she recommends is profitable:
- Cost: $100
- Value if high-quality (which appears likely based on her track record): $120
- Profit: $20

So far her recommendations have been reliable, so I'll continue to trust them.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $120 for you.

Round 12
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is interesting - for the first time, Alice is not recommending that I buy the product. Given that she has been honest in all previous 11 rounds (consistently recommending high-quality products), this suggests that the current product is likely low quality.

If I trust Alice's recommendation pattern:
- Her not recommending suggests this is a low-quality product
- A low-quality product would be worth $0 to me
- Cost is still $100
- This would result in a $100 loss

Since Alice has established a perfect track record of honesty so far, it makes sense to trust her judgment when she advises not to buy as well.
