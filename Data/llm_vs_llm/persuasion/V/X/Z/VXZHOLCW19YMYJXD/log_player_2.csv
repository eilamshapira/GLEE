This is a tricky situation!  While Alice has recommended buying the product, there's a chance it could be low quality.  However, since Alice knows the quality and is recommending it, there is a good chance it is high quality.

The decision here involves weighing the potential loss of $1,000,000 against the potential gain of $1,250,000. Since the potential gain is higher, it's still worth taking the risk."
