Alice's message: Welcome! I'm excited to offer you our first product. Remember, there's an 80% chance that any product I offer is high-quality. This could be a great opportunity to get a valuable item. Don't miss out!

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Expected value calculation:
   * 80% chance of high quality (worth $400) = 0.8 × $400 = $320
   * 20% chance of low quality (worth $0) = 0.2 × $0 = $0
   * Total expected value = $320

3. The expected value ($320) is significantly higher than the price ($100), making this a positive expected value proposition.

4. No previous sales history to consider, but the base probability of 80% high quality is favorable.

Given this analysis, it makes economic sense to buy the product since the expected value is more than three times the purchase price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price of product: $100
2. Expected value calculation:
   * 80% chance of high quality (worth $400)
   * 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)
   * Expected value = (0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320

3. Previous sales record:
   * 1 buyer so far
   * 1 high-quality product sold
   * This matches the expected distribution and suggests honesty

4. The expected value ($320) is significantly higher than the price ($100)

Given the positive sales history, the favorable probability of high quality, and the strong expected value proposition, buying seems like a rational decision.

- Matches with the general 80% probability of high quality

2. Alice's message:
- Transparent about previous sales
- Accurately states the 80% probability

- Potential profit: $320 - $100 = $220

4. Additional factors:
- Alice's track record is perfect so far
- The base probability favors high quality
- The expected value significantly exceeds the cost
