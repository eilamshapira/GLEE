Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice doesn't recommend buying the product, which suggests it might be low quality
2. No prior sales history to evaluate Alice's trustworthiness
3. Price is $1,000,000
4. Expected value calculation:
   * 33.33% chance of $2,000,000 = $666,667
   * 66.67% chance of $0 = $0
   * Total expected value = $666,667
5. Since price ($1,000,000) > expected value ($666,667), and Alice doesn't recommend it

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33%): $2,000,000
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.3333 × $2,000,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $666,600

Since the expected value ($666,600) is less than the price ($1,000,000), even with Alice's recommendation, it would not be rational to buy the product. There's no track record yet to establish Alice's credibility in recommendations.

Given that the expected value is less than the price, and the seller is not recommending the purchase, the rational decision would be not to buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. Price is $1,000,000
2. If high quality (33.33% chance): worth $2,000,000 (profit of $1,000,000)
3. If low quality (66.67% chance): worth $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
4. Alice does not recommend buying
5. Alice knows the true quality
6. Alice has no sales history yet

Expected value without considering Alice's recommendation:
(0.3333 × $2,000,000) + (0.6667 × $0) - $1,000,000 = -$333,400

Given that Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying, this suggests the product is likely low quality. This further reduces the expected value.

   - Alice knows the true quality and has no incentive to lie

Given that Alice doesn't recommend buying and the expected value ($666,660) is less than the price ($1,000,000), it's likely this is a low-quality product.

3. Price is $1M
4. Alice doesn't recommend buying
5. Since Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying, this is likely a negative signal

Given that Alice's lack of recommendation is likely an honest signal about low quality (since she has no established pattern of deception), and the expected value without her input is already below the asking price, I should not buy.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think this through:

1. Each product has:
- 33.33% chance of being high quality (worth $2M)
- 66.67% chance of being low quality (worth $0)
- Price is $1M

2. Alice doesn't recommend buying
- Since Alice has no sales history yet, we can't judge her credibility
- However, she has no obvious incentive to lie about the quality
- Her negative recommendation suggests the product is likely low quality

3. Expected value calculation:
- If the product is indeed low quality (more likely given Alice's recommendation)
- I would lose the entire $1M investment

The fact that Alice is not recommending the purchase, combined with the base probability of low quality being higher (66.67%), makes this seem like a risky investment.
