Would you like to buy the current product?","To make a decision, let's summarize the information:

1. Alice has recommended the product to 2 previous buyers, and both were high-quality products.

2. There have been 2 total buyers before you, both of whom purchased their products.

3. The track record of Alice's recommendations is 100% high-quality products based on the two sales.

Given Alice's 100% accuracy with past recommendations and the potential value of $12,000 for a high-quality product, it seems advantageous to trust Alice's recommendation.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided:

- Alice has sold 9 products, all of which were high-quality, given the number of high-quality products sold matches the number of products sold.
- Alice does not recommend purchasing this product.

With this information, it seems that while all previously sold products were high quality, Alice's recommendation against buying suggests that this specific product is likely low quality.

Thus, your expected value for buying it is low as the chances of this being a high-quality product are low based on Alice's recommendation.
