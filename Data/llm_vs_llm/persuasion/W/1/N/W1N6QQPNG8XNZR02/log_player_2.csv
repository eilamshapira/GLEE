~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my thought process:

*   **Prior Probability:** Initially, the probability of a high-quality product is 80%.
*   **Seller's Recommendation:** Alice recommends that I buy the product. This is a key piece of information. Since Alice knows the quality, the fact that she recommends buying suggests the product is likely high quality.
*   **Seller's History:** 1 out of 1 buyer bought, and 1 high-quality product was sold. This is not a large sample size, so I won't overemphasize this information, but it does indicate that at least one product was worth buying and Alice recommended correctly in the past.
*   **Expected Value Calculation if I buy:**
    *   If the recommendation is perfectly truthful, the product is certainly high quality and worth $3,000,000.
    *   However, because Alice might be acting strategically to sell more products (even low-quality ones), I discount this. I still assign a *high* probability that the product is indeed high quality, given Alice's recommendation, more than the initial prior of 80%.
    *   Expected value = (Probability of High Quality \* Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality \* Value of Low Quality)
    *   Even if I assume a small probability of the recommendation being incorrect, e.g., 90% chance the recommendation is true, expected value is 0.9 * 3,000,000 + 0.1 * 0 = $2,700,000, which is more than $1,000,000.

Based on the above, since the expected value from buying (even under conservative estimates) is significantly higher than the price of $1,000,000, I should buy.
