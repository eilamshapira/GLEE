"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'll decide whether to buy the product or not based on Alice's recommendation. 

Let me analyze the situation:
- The product costs $10,000
- High-quality product (80% chance) is worth $12,000 to me
- Low-quality product (20% chance) is worth $0 to me
- Expected value = (80% × $12,000) + (20% × $0) = $9,600
- The expected value is less than the cost ($9,600 < $10,000)

However, Alice knows the true quality and has recommended buying this product. If Alice is being honest, this suggests the product is high quality (worth $12,000).

Since Alice is recommending it, I'll buy the product.

- The product costs $10,000
- High-quality product (80% chance) is worth $12,000 to me
- Low-quality product (20% chance) is worth $0 to me

Since Alice is again recommending to buy the product, and her previous recommendation was honest, I'll trust her recommendation again and buy the product.
