Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $10,000
2. Possible values:
   - High quality (33.33%): $20,000 (profit of $10,000)
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0 (loss of $10,000)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (33.33% × $20,000) + (66.67% × $0) = $6,666
   
4. Since the expected value ($6,666) is less than the price ($10,000), and there's no track record to validate Alice's recommendation, this would be a risky purchase.

4. Since the expected value ($6,666) is less than the price ($10,000), purchasing would be a negative expected value decision.

5. While Alice recommends buying, there's no track record to establish her credibility, and she has an incentive to sell regardless of quality.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   * High quality (33.33% chance): $20,000 profit
   * Low quality (66.67% chance): $10,000 loss

Expected value calculation:
* (0.3333 × $20,000) + (0.6667 × $0) - $10,000 = $6,666 - $10,000 = -$3,334

Even though Alice recommends buying the product, I have no historical data to verify her trustworthiness. The expected value is negative, meaning on average I would lose money.

3. Expected Value calculation:
   (33.33% × $20,000) + (66.67% × $0) = $6,666
   This is less than the $10,000 price.

4. Additional factors:
   - No previous sales history to verify Alice's reliability
   - Alice's recommendation, but she has incentive to sell regardless of quality
   - Higher probability of low quality (66.67%)

Given the expected value is less than the price and there's no track record to trust Alice's recommendation, it would be rational to decline.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Cost of product: $10,000
2. Value if high quality: $20,000 (33.33% chance)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (66.67% chance)

Expected value calculation:
* (0.3333 × $20,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $6,666

Since the expected value ($6,666) is less than the cost ($10,000), and there's no previous sales history to validate Alice's recommendation, it would be rational to decline.

- There's no track record to verify Alice's credibility
- The base probability heavily favors low quality (66.67%)
- The potential loss equals the potential gain, but the probability of loss is higher
