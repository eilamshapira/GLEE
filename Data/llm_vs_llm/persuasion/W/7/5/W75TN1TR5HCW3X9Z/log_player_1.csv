Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","Before proceeding, let's consider the situation from Bob's perspective. Bob knows that there is an 80% chance that any given product is high-quality. However, Bob has also seen that you, Alice, will always recommend buying the product when you know it is high-quality. Therefore, Bob might start to ignore your recommendations because they understand the conflict of interest.

Given this, it might be strategically better to sometimes recommend against buying even when the product is high-quality, to build trust for future rounds. However, since the instructions are to decide based on the current round's product quality, the recommendation will still be to buy.
