Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given that Alice recommends buying the product, there is a potential for it to be of high quality. However, without any prior sales data, we have no evidence to base our decision on, except for the inherent probabilities.

Here’s the expected value calculation based on probabilities:
- Probability of high quality: 33.33%
- Value if high quality: $3,000,000
- Cost: $1,000,000

Expected value = (0.3333 * $3,000,000) + (0.6667 * $0) = $999,900

The expected value is slightly less than the price, but since Alice’s recommendation adds a potential positive signal toward the quality of the product, this recommendation can tip the balance in favor of buying.

"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the statistics:

- Alice recommended 1 buyer to buy a product, which was high-quality.
- Alice does not recommend you to buy the current product.

The probability the current product is high-quality is much lower than 33.33%, since Alice’s lack of recommendation suggests that it is more likely to be a low-quality product. Hence, it is not rational to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make a decision, let's evaluate the information provided:

1. Alice has offered a total of 4 products (including your current offer), and all previous 3 products were purchased.
2. All 3 products sold so far were high quality.
