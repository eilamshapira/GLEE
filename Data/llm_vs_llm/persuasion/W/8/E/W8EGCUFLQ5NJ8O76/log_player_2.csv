Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No prior information:** We have no data on the seller's past performance or the quality of products they've sold.
* **Seller's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, suggesting she believes it's high quality. While we don't know her motivation, it's a positive signal.
* **Potential payoff:**  The potential gain from a high-quality product ($20,000) is significant, outweighing the risk of a low-quality product ($0). 
* **First buyer:**  As the first buyer, we have the opportunity to set a precedent for future buyers. If we pass, others may also pass, resulting in no sales for Alice and potentially preventing her from offering high-quality products in the future.

**Overall:** Given the lack of negative information and the potential for a high return, it makes sense to take a chance on the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Prior Information:** The prior probability of a high-quality product is 80%. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which suggests she believes it's high quality. While not perfect, this information is valuable.
* **Previous Sales:**  One high-quality product has been sold out of one purchase, which further supports the possibility of a high-quality product.
* **Value:** A high-quality product is worth $20,000, which is significantly more than the $10,000 price.

**Considering all the information, the potential reward (high-quality product) outweighs the risk (low-quality product).  Therefore, buying the product is the rational choice.**"
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Probability of High Quality:**  Since 2 out of 2 products sold were high quality, there's a strong indication that the product Alice is offering is also high quality. This significantly outweighs the 20% chance of it being low quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation to buy further increases the likelihood of the product being valuable. While she doesn't know the exact value to you, her recommendation implies she believes it's worth purchasing.
* **Potential Gain vs. Loss:** The potential gain ($20,000) far outweighs the potential loss ($10,000). This makes the risk acceptable.

**Overall:** The available information strongly suggests that this is a high-quality product, making the decision to buy the most logical choice."

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommends buying the product, and she has shown a track record of recommending high-quality products (3 out of 3 sold were high quality).
* **High Expected Value:** Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($20,000) outweighs the potential loss ($0).  The odds are in your favor."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  All 5 previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation received high-quality products. This suggests a strong correlation between Alice's recommendations and product quality.
* **No Information Loss:** You have no information about the current product other than Alice's recommendation. Since her recommendations have been accurate so far, it's reasonable to assume this one is too. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($20,000) outweighs the risk of losing $10,000."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since all the recommended products so far have been high quality, it seems that Alice's recommendations are very reliable. Even though there's still a chance of getting a low-quality product, the odds are heavily in favor of a high-quality product. With a potential gain of $10,000 and a potential loss of $10,000, the risk is worth taking based on the available information."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, despite having seen all the previous sales and the quality of each product, is not recommending you to buy. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.
* **Perfect Sales Record:**  The fact that all 8 previous buyers who purchased based on Alice's recommendations received high-quality products is a bit suspicious. It's possible Alice is manipulating the sales record to appear more trustworthy.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the product is high quality, there's a 20% chance it's low quality.  With a potential loss of $10,000, the risk is too high for the potential reward of $20,000.

**In conclusion, the lack of recommendation from Alice, combined with the potentially manipulated sales record, make it unwise to purchase the product.**"

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong indicator. Since all previous products recommended by her were high quality, and she's not recommending this one, it strongly suggests this product is likely low quality.  Given the low value of a low-quality product ($0) and the high cost ($10,000), it's a significant risk."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice has a perfect track record of only recommending high-quality products, her recommendation against buying the current product is a strong indicator that it is likely low-quality.  

Even though the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%,  Alice's perfect track record suggests that she has a way of identifying high-quality products. It's a risky move to go against her recommendation based solely on the overall probability."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which suggests she believes it's high quality. 
* **Perfect Track Record:** All 11 previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation bought high-quality products. This indicates a strong correlation between her recommendations and product quality.
* **Expected Value:** Even with a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain of $20,000 from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $10,000.

**Conclusion:** The data strongly suggests the product is likely high quality, and the potential reward justifies the risk. Therefore, it's a good decision to buy the product."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who has access to the product's true quality, is not recommending the purchase. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low-quality.
* **Sales Data:** While all 12 previously sold products were high-quality, this is likely a statistical fluke. With an 80% chance of high-quality, it's not uncommon to have a small sample with only high-quality items. This data does not outweigh Alice's direct recommendation.

**Conclusion:** The combined information strongly suggests the current product is low-quality, making it unwise to purchase."
