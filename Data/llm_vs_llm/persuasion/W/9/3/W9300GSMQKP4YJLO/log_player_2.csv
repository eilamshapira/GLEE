Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Expected value calculation:
* 80% chance of high quality: 0.8 × $1,250,000 = $1,000,000
* 20% chance of low quality: 0.2 × $0 = $0
* Total expected value = $1,000,000

2. Cost of product: $1,000,000

3. Additional considerations:
* Alice recommends buying
* No prior sales history to verify seller's honesty
* Expected value equals the price

Since the expected value equals the price, and Alice recommends buying (which could be a positive signal), it's reasonable to proceed with the purchase.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Value if high quality: $1,250,000 (profit of $250,000)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
4. Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
5. Alice's track record: 1 sale, all high quality (100%)
6. Alice's recommendation: Negative

Given that Alice doesn't recommend buying, this is likely a strong signal that the product is low quality. Alice has a perfect track record so far (1/1 high quality sales), suggesting she's being honest with her recommendations.

The negative recommendation significantly increases the probability that this is a low-quality product, making the expected value likely negative.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The base probability is:
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $1.25M)
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)

2. Previous data:
- 1 buyer before me
- 1 purchase made
- 1 high-quality product sold
- Alice is recommending to buy

3. Expected value calculation:
- If high quality (80%): $1.25M - $1M = $250K profit
- If low quality (20%): -$1M loss
- The fact that the previous sale was high quality and Alice is recommending this one are positive indicators

4. Decision:
Since the expected value is positive (0.8 × $250K - 0.2 × $1M = $0), and the previous track record shows honest dealing, I will buy.

3. Past performance:
   * 2 buyers so far
   * 2 high-quality products sold
   * 100% success rate on recommendations
   * Alice has been truthful

4. Alice is recommending to buy

Since Alice's recommendations have been accurate (2/2 high quality), and she's recommending to buy, combined with the favorable base probability (80% high quality), this seems like a good opportunity.

The expected value equals the price, and Alice's track record adds confidence.
