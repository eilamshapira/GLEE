"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this rationally.

Alice is recommending that I buy the product. In this game, each product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $30,000 to me) and a 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me).

If I buy the product:
- If it's high quality, I pay $10,000 and get something worth $30,000, for a profit of $20,000
- If it's low quality, I pay $10,000 and get something worth $0, for a loss of $10,000

The expected value of buying is: 0.5 × $20,000 + 0.5 × (-$10,000) = $10,000 + (-$5,000) = $5,000

Since the expected value is positive, it makes sense to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation.

Alice is NOT recommending that I buy this product. In Round 1, she recommended a product that turned out to be high quality, which suggests she might be honest in her recommendations.

If she's being honest and recommending against buying, this likely means the product is low quality. 

If I buy the product:
- If it's high quality (seems unlikely based on Alice's recommendation): +$20,000 profit
- If it's low quality (more likely based on Alice's recommendation): -$10,000 loss

Given that Alice has shown trustworthiness in her first recommendation and is now advising against purchase, it seems reasonable to follow her advice here.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation.

So far, Alice's recommendations have been truthful and aligned with the product quality:
- In Round 1, she recommended buying, and the product was high quality
- In Round 2, she recommended not buying, and the product was indeed low quality

Given this pattern, Alice appears to be honestly signaling product quality through her recommendations.

Now in Round 3, Alice is recommending that I buy the product. Based on her track record, this suggests the product is likely high quality.

If I buy the product:
- If it's high quality (likely based on Alice's recommendation pattern): I pay $10,000 for something worth $30,000, for a $20,000 profit
- If it's low quality (unlikely given her recommendation): I lose $10,000

Given Alice's consistent recommendations so far, I'll follow her advice.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation.

Alice's recommendations have continued to be reliable and honest:
- Round 1: She recommended buying → High quality ✓
- Round 2: She recommended not buying → Low quality ✓
- Round 3: She recommended buying → High quality ✓

Her track record suggests she's truthfully revealing product quality through her recommendations. She now recommends buying again in Round 4.

Given her perfect accuracy so far, it seems reasonable to trust her recommendation again.

If I buy (assuming her recommendation is reliable):
- Most likely high quality: $10,000 cost for $30,000 value = $20,000 profit

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.
