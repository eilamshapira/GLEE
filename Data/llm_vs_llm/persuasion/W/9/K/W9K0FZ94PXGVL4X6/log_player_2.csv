Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information provided:

1. No products have been sold yet, so I don't have historical data on Alice's recommendations.
2. Alice does not recommend buying the product.
3. Since Alice knows the true quality and has chosen not to recommend it, this suggests the product is likely low quality.
4. If the product is low quality (worth $0 to me) and costs $10,000, purchasing would result in a loss.

Without any track record to evaluate Alice's trustworthiness and with her negative recommendation, the rational choice is to decline.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to carefully analyze this situation:

- The product costs $10,000
- High-quality product is worth $40,000 to me (profit of $30,000)
- Low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- Prior probability: 50% chance of high quality, 50% chance of low quality
- Alice knows the true quality and recommends buying

The key consideration is whether Alice's recommendation is credible. Since Alice profits regardless of quality, she has an incentive to recommend buying regardless of true quality.

Without any sales history to evaluate Alice's honesty, and with no mechanism ensuring truthful recommendations, I should rely on the base probabilities:
- 50% chance of gaining $30,000
- 50% chance of losing $10,000
- Expected value: (0.5 × $30,000) + (0.5 × -$10,000) = $10,000

Since the expected value is positive, it's rational to buy.

1. There has been 1 buyer before me who purchased based on Alice's recommendation.
2. 0 high-quality products have been sold so far.
3. Alice does not recommend me to buy the current product.

This suggests that Alice's previous recommendation led to the sale of a low-quality product. Given that Alice knows the true quality and is now recommending against purchase, it's likely this product is low quality. If I purchase it, I would pay $10,000 for something worth $0 to me.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to carefully analyze this situation.

Alice is selling products priced at $10,000 that have a 50% chance of being high quality ($40,000 value) or low quality ($0 value).

The statistics show:
- 1 previous buyer purchased based on Alice's recommendation
- 0 high-quality products have been sold so far

This means the previous buyer who followed Alice's recommendation received a low-quality product. This suggests Alice's recommendations may not be reliable.

If I buy, I have a 50% chance of getting $40,000 worth of value for $10,000, but also a 50% chance of losing my $10,000 entirely. However, Alice's track record so far (0/1 good recommendations) is concerning.

Given this information, I will decline the offer.

Alice has sold 1 product so far, but 0 high-quality products. This means the previous buyer purchased a low-quality product based on Alice's recommendation.

Alice is now recommending that I buy the current product. Given that:

- High-quality products are worth $40,000 to me (profit of $30,000)
- Low-quality products are worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- Alice has a 0% track record of selling high-quality products so far
- Alice knows the true quality of each product

Alice's past recommendation led to the sale of a low-quality product, which suggests her recommendations may not be reliable. The expected value calculation doesn't favor making the purchase given this track record.

Alice is offering a product for $10,000. If it's high quality, it's worth $40,000 to me (profit of $30,000), but if it's low quality, it's worth $0 (loss of $10,000).

Looking at the statistics:
- 1 previous buyer purchased based on Alice's recommendation
- 0 high-quality products have been sold

This means the previous buyer received a low-quality product after following Alice's recommendation. This suggests Alice's recommendations might not be reliable.

Since Alice is now recommending I buy the product, and the previous buyer who followed her recommendation got a low-quality product, I'm concerned about the trustworthiness of her recommendation.

Expected value calculation:
- If I trust the prior statistics more than the recommendation: negative expected value
- The fact that 0/1 recommendations led to high-quality products is concerning

Alice is recommending that I buy the product.

The key statistics:
- 1 previous buyer purchased a product
- 0 high-quality products have been sold
- This means the 1 previous sale was a low-quality product

This is concerning because it suggests Alice may be recommending products regardless of quality. The fact that Alice has previously sold a low-quality product while presumably recommending it raises doubts about the reliability of her recommendations.

With a $10,000 cost and a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product (worth $40,000) or a low-quality product (worth $0), the expected value would normally be $20,000, making it a good deal. However, given the evidence that Alice's recommendation didn't lead to a high-quality product before, I should be cautious.

Looking at the statistics:

The price is $10,000, which is less than the expected value of $20,000. However, the fact that Alice recommended a low-quality product to the previous buyer is concerning.

This is concerning because the previous recommendation resulted in a sale but wasn't a high-quality product. Alice seems to be making recommendations that don't correlate with actual quality. The expected value calculation is:

If I assume a 50% chance of high quality:
EV = 0.5 × $30,000 + 0.5 × (-$10,000) = $10,000

However, given Alice's track record of recommending low-quality products (0/1 high quality), I should adjust my probability estimate downward, making the expected value negative.

From the statistics:
- 1 buyer has purchased based on Alice's recommendations
- 0 high-quality products have been sold
- Alice is not recommending I buy this product

Since 1 buyer purchased but 0 high-quality products have been sold, this suggests that the previous buyer purchased a low-quality product. This implies Alice's recommendations may not be reliable.

In this case, Alice is not recommending I buy the product. Given that her previous recommendation led to a low-quality purchase, her recommendation to not buy might actually be reverse psychology, or it might be truthful.

However, with only one previous data point and the fact that Alice benefits from selling regardless of quality, I don't have enough evidence to contradict her recommendation.

With a 50% chance of high quality (worth $40,000) vs low quality (worth $0), my expected value is $20,000 against a price of $10,000. But Alice's warning and the previous sale history suggest the current product is more likely low quality.
