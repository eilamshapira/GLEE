Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential values:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $1,250,000 (profit of $250,000)
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): $0 (loss of $1,000,000)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (33.33% × $1,250,000) + (66.67% × $0) = $416,625

Since the expected value ($416,625) is less than the price ($1,000,000), and there's no previous sales history to build trust in Alice's recommendations, it would be financially unwise to buy.

1. Expected value calculation:
- 33.33% chance of high quality ($1,250,000) = $416,667
- 66.67% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $416,667

2. Cost of product = $1,000,000

3. Considerations:
- No sales history to evaluate Alice's trustworthiness
- Expected value ($416,667) is less than the cost ($1,000,000)
- Even with a positive recommendation, the risk is too high

Since the expected value is significantly lower than the asking price, and there's no track record to establish trust, it would not be rational to buy.

1. Each product has:
- 33.33% chance of being high quality (worth $1,250,000)

2. The price is fixed at $1,000,000
