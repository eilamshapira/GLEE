The reasoning behind this decision is that the expected value of buying a product is:

\( E = 0.3333 \times 1,250,000 + 0.6667 \times 0 = 416,625 \)

Since this expected value ($416,625) is less than the cost of the product ($1,000,000), the optimal strategy is to decline the purchase in each round."
