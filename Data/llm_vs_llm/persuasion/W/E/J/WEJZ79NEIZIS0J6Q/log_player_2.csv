{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though there is no prior information about the quality of products, Alice's recommendation to buy carries some weight. Since a high-quality product is worth $12,000 and a low-quality product is worth $0, the potential gain from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product. 

The 80% chance of getting a high-quality product makes the decision to buy more favorable than passing."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, despite not knowing your valuation, recommends buying the product. This suggests she has a good reason to believe it's high quality.
* **Past Sales Data:** While the data is limited, it indicates a 100% success rate with high-quality products being sold.  This further supports the likelihood of the current product being high quality.
* **Expected Value:**  Even with a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($12,000) significantly outweighs the potential loss ($0).

Therefore, the decision is to buy the product."
