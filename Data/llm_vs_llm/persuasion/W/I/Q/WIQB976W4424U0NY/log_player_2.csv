Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this carefully:

1. The product costs $10,000
2. If high quality, I gain $30,000 (net profit $20,000)
3. If low quality, I gain $0 (net loss $10,000)
4. Alice doesn't recommend buying it, which suggests it might be low quality
5. With no prior sales history, I can only rely on Alice's recommendation
6. Alice has no incentive to lie since her reputation is at stake

Given Alice's negative recommendation and no prior history to evaluate her trustworthiness, it would be risky to buy the product.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50%): $30,000
   - Low quality (50%): $0

Expected value calculation:
(50% × $30,000) + (50% × $0) = $15,000

Since the expected value ($15,000) is higher than the price ($10,000), and Alice is recommending the purchase, it makes economic sense to buy.

1. Price of product: $10,000
2. Value if high quality: $30,000 (profit of $20,000)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $10,000)
4. Previous statistics:
   - 1 buyer before me
   - 1 high-quality product sold
   - Alice has a 100% track record so far
5. Alice recommends buying

This looks promising because:
- Alice has a perfect track record (1/1 high quality)
- She's recommending this product
- Expected value calculation: 
  * If I trust her recommendation, I can make $20,000 profit
  * The previous success suggests she's being honest

Given these factors, I'll take the risk.

1. Previous track record:
- 2 buyers purchased products
- Both products were high quality (100% high quality rate)
- Alice has been honest with previous buyers

2. Current situation:
- Alice is NOT recommending the product
- Given Alice's honest track record, this is a strong signal that the product is low quality
- If low quality, I would lose $10,000 (pay $10,000 for something worth $0)
- If high quality, I would gain $20,000 (pay $10,000 for something worth $30,000)

3. Decision:
- Alice has shown honesty in previous sales
- Her recommendation against buying likely means this is a low-quality product
- The risk of losing $10,000 is too high given this negative recommendation

3. Prior statistics:
   - 3 buyers purchased
   - 3 high-quality products were sold
   - Perfect track record so far (100% high quality)
4. Alice does NOT recommend this product

Given that Alice has a perfect track record of selling only high-quality products and she specifically recommends against buying this product, this strongly suggests that this particular product is low quality. It appears Alice is being honest in her recommendations.

If the product is low quality, it would be worth $0, making the $10,000 purchase price a complete loss.

Given Alice's perfect track record and her recommendation to buy, the probability of getting a high-quality product seems significantly higher than 50%. The potential profit ($20,000) outweighs the potential loss ($10,000).

Expected value calculation:
