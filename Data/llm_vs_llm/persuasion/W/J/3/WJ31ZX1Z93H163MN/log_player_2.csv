Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my reasoning:

*   **Prior Probability:** Without any information, the chance of the product being high quality is 80%.
*   **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. This is crucial information, but we need to consider her incentives. She always wants to sell.
*   **Statistics:** 11 high-quality products have been sold out of an unknown number of attempts. This tells us that either a lot of low-quality products were also offered, and people passed on them, or that Alice is good at identifying high-quality products.
*   **Risk-Reward:** If it's high quality, I gain $1,000,000 ($2,000,000 value - $1,000,000 price). If it's low quality, I lose $1,000,000.
Given Alice's recommendation and the fact that only high-quality products have been sold, it is likely the recommendation is correlated to the product's quality, so I will take the risk.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my reasoning:

*   **Prior Probability:** The initial probability of a high-quality product is 80%.
*   **Seller's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product. We need to consider if this recommendation is informative, or if Alice always recommends buying.
*   **Observed Sales Record:** 12 high-quality products have been sold out of 12 potential buyers. This is unusual, as a random distribution would have led to about 9.6 high quality sales in the past 12 sales attempts. It implies Alice might be selectively offering products to buyers when she knows they are high quality.

Since the seller recommends buying, and given the extremely high proportion of high-quality sales so far, I should buy.
