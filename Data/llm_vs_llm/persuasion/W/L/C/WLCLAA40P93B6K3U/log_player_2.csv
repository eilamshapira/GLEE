Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

- The product costs $1,000,000
- It has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $1,200,000)
- It has a 20% chance of being low quality (worth $0)
- The seller Alice recommends buying it
- No products have been sold yet

My expected value from purchasing:
(0.8 × $1,200,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $960,000

Since the expected value ($960,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), it would not be rational for me to purchase the product.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information provided, I'll analyze this decision:

- The product costs $1,000,000
- If high quality, it's worth $1,200,000 to me (profit of $200,000)
- If low quality, it's worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000)
- Probability of high quality: 80%
- Probability of low quality: 20%
- Alice recommends buying the product
- No sales history yet to evaluate Alice's recommendations

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $1,200,000) + (0.2 × $0) - $1,000,000 = $960,000 - $1,000,000 = -$40,000

While Alice recommends buying, the expected value is negative. Without any sales history to gauge the reliability of Alice's recommendations, I should make my decision based on the fundamental probabilities.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make a decision, I need to analyze the expected value:

- The product costs $1,000,000
- If high quality: worth $1,200,000 (80% chance)
- If low quality: worth $0 (20% chance)

Expected value = (0.8 × $1,200,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $960,000

Since the expected value ($960,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), it's not rational to buy without additional information.

However, Alice is recommending the purchase, which suggests she believes it's high quality. If I trust Alice's recommendation, this could change my assessment.

Given that no one has bought products yet, I have no historical data to evaluate Alice's truthfulness. Without evidence of Alice's reliability, I should rely on the objective probabilities.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether buying the product is a good decision based on the information provided.

Expected value calculation:
- Price: $1,000,000
- Value if high quality (80% probability): $1,200,000
- Value if low quality (20% probability): $0

Expected value = (0.8 × $1,200,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $960,000

Since the expected value ($960,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), this doesn't appear to be a good purchase from a purely statistical standpoint.

However, Alice is recommending I buy the product. This might indicate she knows it's high quality, but I don't have enough information about her recommendation patterns to know if her recommendation is reliable.

Given the current information where the expected value is less than the price, I should decline.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision:

The product costs $1,000,000.
If high quality (80% chance), it's worth $1,200,000 to me, giving a profit of $200,000.
If low quality (20% chance), it's worth $0 to me, giving a loss of $1,000,000.

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $200,000) + (0.2 × -$1,000,000) = $160,000 - $200,000 = -$40,000

Since the expected value is negative, it's not rational to buy the product based purely on the prior probabilities.

Alice's recommendation could potentially provide additional information, but without knowing how reliable her recommendations are (this is our first interaction), I can't assign much value to it.

- If I don't buy: $0

Without additional information about Alice's recommendation behavior, the expected value calculation suggests that buying is not profitable. The recommendation itself might be strategic rather than honest since Alice benefits from selling regardless of quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether buying this product is a positive expected value decision.

Expected value if I buy:
