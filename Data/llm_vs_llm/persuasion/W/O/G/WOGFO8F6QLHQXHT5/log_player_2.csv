Alice recommends you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

With 14 consecutive accurate recommendations from Alice, her recommendations seem reliable, so it is logical to continue trusting her advice. However, let's perform a quick expected value calculation.

- Probability of high-quality product (P_HQ) = 0.8
- Probability of low-quality product (P_LQ) = 0.2
- Value of high-quality product (V_HQ) = $20,000
- Value of low-quality product (V_LQ) = $0
- Cost to buy (C) = $10,000

Expected Value (EV) if Alice recommends buying:
EV = (P_HQ \* V_HQ) - C + (P_LQ \* V_LQ)
EV = (0.8 \* $20,000) - $10,000 + (0.2 \* $0)
EV = $16,000 - $10,000
EV = $6,000

Since the expected value is positive ($6,000), it is profitable to follow Alice's recommendation to buy the product."

Round 15
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

As Alice's advice continues to be accurate, it is reasonable to keep trusting her recommendations. The expected value calculation also supports this decision."

Round 16
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Given Alice's reliable track record, it makes sense to continue following her advice. Additionally, let's consider the expected value if Alice does not recommend buying the product.

- Probability of high-quality product (P_HQ) = 0.8
- Probability of low-quality product (P_LQ) = 0.2
- Value of high-quality product (V_HQ) = $20,000
- Value of low-quality product (V_LQ) = $0
- Cost to buy (C) = $10,000

Expected Value (EV) if Alice does not recommend buying:
EV = (P_HQ \* V_HQ) - C + (P_LQ \* V_LQ)

However, since Alice does not recommend buying the product, the probabilities are likely inverted:
- P_HQ = 0.2
- P_LQ = 0.8

EV = (0.2 \* $20,000) - $10,000 + (0.8 \* $0)
EV = $4,000 - $10,000
EV = -$6,000

Since the expected value is negative (-$6,000), it is not profitable to buy the product when Alice does not recommend it."
