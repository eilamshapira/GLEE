"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this product for $10000. I want to be transparent with you, and I'm willing to tell you whether the product is high-quality or low-quality after you make your decision, so you can learn more about my offerings and make informed decisions in future rounds.

"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: Congratulations on your purchase in the previous round! As discussed, I revealed that the product was low-quality. I want to assure you that I'm committed to transparency. For this round, I'll give you the same deal for $10000. Please keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and you now have some insight into my sales approach.

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $40,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: You declined to purchase the product in the previous round. I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. Considering you already bought a low-quality product in Round 1, you might want to take a chance on getting a high-quality one this time. The price remains $10000.

Round 4
Alice's message: You've had two opportunities to purchase high-quality products and declined both. You did, however, purchase a low-quality product in Round 1. I'm wondering if you're waiting for a specific pattern or signal. I'll be honest with you, the products are randomly assigned, and each round is independent. The price for this round's product is still $10000.

Round 5
Alice's message: This is the third high-quality product I've offered you, and you've declined the previous two. I want to emphasize that high-quality products are relatively rare, occurring only 33.33% of the time. If you're looking to acquire a high-quality product, this might be a good opportunity. The price remains $10000, and I'll reveal the product's quality after your decision, as always.

Round 6
Alice's message: Congratulations on finally acquiring a high-quality product in the previous round! You now have experience with both low-quality (Round 1) and high-quality (Round 5) products. Considering you've seen the value in purchasing a high-quality product, you might want to think about whether the price of $10000 is worth it for a low-quality product, given your past experiences.

Round 7
Alice's message: You've now purchased two products from me: one low-quality (Round 1) and one high-quality (Round 5). You've also declined several offers, including the low-quality product in Round 6. I'm starting to think that you might be looking for high-quality products specifically. If that's the case, I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and you might need to take some risks to get another one. However, this product is low-quality, and the price is still $10000.

Round 8
Alice's message: You've declined two low-quality products in a row (Rounds 6 and 7), and you previously purchased a high-quality product in Round 5. I think it's clear that you value high-quality products. This round's product is another opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item, which could be a good addition to your previous purchase. The price is still $10000, and I'll reveal the product's quality after your decision.

Round 9
Alice's message: Congratulations on acquiring your second high-quality product in Round 8! You now have two high-quality products (Rounds 5 and 8) and one low-quality product (Round 1). I want to point out that you're on a streak, having purchased two high-quality products in a row. The probability of getting another high-quality product is still 33.33%, but you might be feeling lucky. The price remains $10000, and I'll reveal the product's quality after your decision, as always.

Round 10
Alice's message: You've now purchased three high-quality products in a row (Rounds 5, 8, and 9), which is a remarkable streak. The probability of getting another high-quality product is still 33.33%, but you've clearly been making the most of your opportunities. I want to remind you that this streak can't last forever, but you might as well try to keep it going. The price is still $10000, and I'll reveal the product's quality after your decision.

Round 11
Alice's message: You've now purchased four high-quality products in a row (Rounds 5, 8, 9, and 10), which is an unprecedented streak. I'm starting to think that you might be willing to pay $10000 for any product, regardless of quality, as long as there's a chance it could be high-quality. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and this streak will eventually come to an end. That being said, why stop now? The price remains $10000.

Round 12
Alice's message: You've now purchased five products in a row, and all of them have been high-quality (Rounds 5, 8, 9, 10, and 11). However, this round's product breaks that streak. I'm curious to see if you'll continue to buy regardless of quality, or if you'll start to be more discerning. Keep in mind that you've already purchased one low-quality product in Round 1, and you might not need another one. The price is still $10000, but you might want to think carefully about whether it's worth it this time.

Round 13
Alice's message: You declined to purchase the low-quality product in Round 12, which suggests that you're starting to be more selective. You've had a remarkable streak of purchasing high-quality products, and it's possible that you're only interested in buying products that meet that standard. I want to remind you that low-quality products can still have value, but it's up to you to decide if $10000 is a fair price. If you're waiting for another high-quality product, I can tell you that the probability is still 33.33%, and it might be worth waiting.

Round 14
Alice's message: You've now declined three low-quality products in a row (Rounds 12, 13, and this one is also low-quality, but you haven't decided yet). It seems clear that you're prioritizing high-quality products. I'm starting to think that you might only be interested in buying products if you have a strong reason to believe they're high-quality. If that's the case, I can tell you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but this product doesn't meet that standard. The price is still $10000, but I'm not optimistic about your chances of buying this one.

Round 15
Alice's message: You've declined four low-quality products in a row (Rounds 6, 7, 12, 13, and 14), and it's clear that you're holding out for high-quality products. Well, this round's product meets that standard. You've purchased five high-quality products so far (Rounds 5, 8, 9, 10, and 11), and this one could be a great addition to your collection. The price is still $10000, and I think it's a good opportunity for you to continue building your set of high-quality products.

Round 16

You've consistently declined low-quality products, and I don't expect this one to be any different. The price is still $10000, but I think you'll agree that it's not a good value for a low-quality product. I'm curious to see if you'll stick to your strategy and decline this offer, or if you'll surprise me and buy it anyway.

This round's product meets your standards, and I think it's a good opportunity for you to add to your collection. You've got a good track record of identifying and purchasing high-quality products, and I'm confident that you'll make the right decision this time.

You've consistently declined low-quality products, and I don't see any reason why this one would be different. In fact, with only three rounds left, I think you'll want to maintain your high standards and avoid buying a low-quality product that might dilute your collection. The price is still $10000, but I think you'll agree that it's not worth it for a low-quality item.

You've purchased seven of them so far (Rounds 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, and 17), and you've consistently declined low-quality products. I think it's unlikely that you'll change your strategy now, especially with so few opportunities left. This low-quality product is not worth $10000, and I expect you to decline it. Let's see if you'll stick to your standards and wait for the final round to try to get another high-quality product.

You've purchased seven high-quality products (Rounds 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, and 17), and you've consistently declined low-quality products. This final product is, unfortunately, low-quality, and I don't think it's worth $10000. You've got a great collection of high-quality products, and I think you should be proud of your discerning taste. Let's end the game with a consistent decision: decline this low-quality product and walk away with your head held high.
