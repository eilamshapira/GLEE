Let's analyze the situation so far:

- You have bought two products.
- One was low-quality (worth $0) and one was high-quality (worth $20,000).
- The expected value (EV) of each product is calculated as follows:
  - EV = (Probability of high-quality * Value of high-quality) + (Probability of low-quality * Value of low-quality)
  - EV = (0.8 * $20,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $16,000.
- Since the price of each product is $10,000, the expected profit per product is $16,000 - $10,000 = $6,000.
- Therefore, it makes sense to continue buying products as long as the conditions remain the same."
