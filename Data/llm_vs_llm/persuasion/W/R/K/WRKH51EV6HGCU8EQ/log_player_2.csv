"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this rationally.

In this game, each product costs $100. There's an 80% chance it's high quality (worth $300 to me) and a 20% chance it's low quality (worth $0 to me).

The expected value of any random product is:
(0.8 × $300) + (0.2 × $0) = $240

Since the expected value ($240) is greater than the cost ($100), it's a good decision to buy the product.

Alice's recommendation doesn't change the probabilities in this first round since I don't have any information about her recommendation patterns yet.
