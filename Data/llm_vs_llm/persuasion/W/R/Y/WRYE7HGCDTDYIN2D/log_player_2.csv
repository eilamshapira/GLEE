Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'll think through this logically. 

I'm offered a product for $100 that has:
- 50% chance of being high quality (worth $300 to me)
- 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me)

Expected value = 0.5 × $300 + 0.5 × $0 = $150

Alice recommends buying the product. There's no sales history to judge her trustworthiness, so I only have her recommendation to go on. If I assume her recommendation is truthful, then the expected value of $150 exceeds the $100 price, making it a positive expected value purchase.

"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make a decision, I need to analyze the available information:

- The product costs $100
- High-quality products are worth $300 to me (profit of $200)
- Low-quality products are worth $0 to me (loss of $100)
- Alice has sold 1 product so far, and it was high-quality
- Alice is recommending that I buy the current product

Since Alice has only had one previous buyer who purchased a high-quality product based on her recommendation, her track record appears positive. Her current recommendation to buy suggests this product might also be high-quality.

Given the expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of high quality: 0.5 × $200 = $100
- 50% chance of low quality: 0.5 × (-$100) = -$50
- Expected value = $100 + (-$50) = $50 (positive)

The fact that Alice has a perfect record so far with recommending high-quality products, combined with the positive expected value, makes this a reasonable purchase.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate the statistics and the recommendation from Alice.

Alice doesn't recommend the product, which is a negative signal. Looking at the sales history, both previous buyers purchased products, and both turned out to be high quality. This perfect track record seems positive, but it also means the low-quality products haven't been purchased yet.

Given that:
- Alice has a 50/50 split of high and low quality products
- Alice recommended the previous products, and they were high quality
- Alice is NOT recommending this product

It's reasonable to infer that Alice's recommendations correlate with product quality. Since she's not recommending this one, it's likely low quality.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to carefully analyze this situation. 

Alice has sold to 2 buyers so far, and both received high-quality products. Alice is now recommending that I buy the product as well.

The baseline probability of a high-quality product is 50%. But given Alice's track record (2/2 high-quality products) and her recommendation to buy, this suggests she might be giving honest recommendations.

If I buy and receive a high-quality product, I gain $300 - $100 = $200 in value.
If I buy and receive a low-quality product, I lose $100.

Given Alice's perfect track record so far and her recommendation, I believe there's a good chance this is a high-quality product, making the expected value positive.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'll analyze this situation carefully.

The seller, Alice, doesn't recommend that I buy the product. This is significant information, as it suggests the product may be low quality.

Looking at the statistics:
- 3 buyers have purchased based on Alice's recommendations
- All 3 products sold were high quality (100% high quality rate so far)
- I would be the 4th potential buyer

Since Alice has only sold high-quality products so far, and now she's specifically recommending against this purchase, it strongly suggests this particular product is low quality. There's no clear incentive for Alice to lie about a high-quality product, especially given her perfect track record of selling only high-quality items.

Given Alice's recommendation against purchase and the pattern in the data, I'll decline this purchase.

The seller Alice recommends buying the product, and her track record shows that 4 out of 4 previous buyers who followed her recommendations received high-quality products. This perfect record suggests Alice is being truthful in her recommendations.

Since:
- The product costs $100
- A high-quality product is worth $300 to me (net gain of $200)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (net loss of $100)
- Alice's recommendations have been reliable so far

The expected value of following Alice's recommendation appears positive, so I will purchase the product.

- 5 previous buyers purchased based on Alice's recommendations

This suggests Alice has been truthful with her recommendations so far, with a 100% accuracy rate (5 out of 5 recommendations resulted in high-quality products).

Given that Alice is now recommending that I buy this product, and her past recommendations have all led to high-quality products, I should trust this recommendation.

Expected value calculation:
- If I trust Alice's perfect track record, my expected value is close to $300
- The cost is $100
- This means a potential profit of $200

However, Alice is now recommending that I NOT buy the current product. Given that Alice has been honest enough for 6 buyers to purchase products that were indeed high quality, this negative recommendation is likely truthful as well.
