"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Base probability of high quality: 80%
2. Expected value calculation:
   * High quality (80%): $3,000,000 * 0.8 = $2,400,000
   * Low quality (20%): $0 * 0.2 = $0
   * Total expected value = $2,400,000

3. Cost of product: $1,000,000

Since the expected value ($2,400,000) is higher than the cost ($1,000,000), it's rational to buy.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze:

1. Previous rounds review:
   * All eight previous rounds: Alice recommended honestly (all high quality)

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze:

1. Previous rounds review:
   * All nine previous rounds: Alice recommended honestly (all high quality)
   * Perfect track record maintains

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze:

1. Previous rounds review:
   * All ten previous rounds: Alice recommended honestly (all high quality)

Round 12
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze this significant change:

1. Previous rounds review:
   * First 10 rounds: Alice recommended honestly (all high quality)
   * Round 11: Alice recommended a low-quality product despite the previous pattern
   * This reveals that Alice's recommendations are not perfectly reliable
   * We should return to trusting the base probabilities

2. Base probability of high quality: 80%
3. Expected value calculation:
   * High quality (80%): $3,000,000 * 0.8 = $2,400,000
   * Low quality (20%): $0 * 0.2 = $0
   * Total expected value = $2,400,000

4. Cost of product: $1,000,000

Despite the recent loss, the fundamental math hasn't changed. The expected value ($2,400,000) is still higher than the cost ($1,000,000). The previous round serves as a good reminder that we're dealing with probabilities, not certainties.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"

Round 13
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze carefully, given the recent pattern change:

1. Previous rounds review:
   * First 10 rounds: All high quality
   * Rounds 11 and 12: Both low quality
   * This sequence suggests a possible shift in Alice's recommendation pattern
   * Alice has continued to recommend buying despite low quality products

2. Base probability of high quality: 80%
3. Expected value calculation:
   * High quality (80%): $3,000,000 * 0.8 = $2,400,000
   * Low quality (20%): $0 * 0.2 = $0
   * Total expected value = $2,400,000

4. Cost of product: $1,000,000

While the base probability calculation still suggests buying (expected value $2,400,000 > cost $1,000,000), the recent pattern of two consecutive low-quality recommendations suggests Alice might be behaving strategically - possibly trying to recoup losses after giving good recommendations earlier. This could indicate her recommendations are no longer reliable.

Given this apparent shift in pattern, it might be prudent to deviate from the base probability calculation.

Round 14

1. Previous rounds review:
   * First 10 rounds: All high quality
   * Rounds 11-12: Low quality

   * My last decision was overly reactive to the two low-quality products

2. Base probability of high quality: 80%

   * Low quality (20%): $0 * 0.2 = $0
   * Total expected value = $2,400,000

4. Cost of product: $1,000,000

I made a mistake in the previous round by overreacting to the two low-quality products and ignoring the fundamental probabilities. The base probability of 80% high quality hasn't changed, and the expected value ($2,400,000) still significantly exceeds the cost ($1,000,000). I should return to making decisions based on these core probabilities.

4. Cost of product: $1,000,000

The last round confirmed that returning to the base probability strategy was correct. The expected value ($2,400,000) remains well above the cost ($1,000,000). The optimal strategy is to continue making decisions based on these fundamental probabilities.

4. Cost of product: $1,000,000

The expected value ($2,400,000) continues to exceed the cost ($1,000,000) by a significant margin. The recent results support staying with the strategy of following the base probabilities. My one deviation from this strategy (Round 13) proved to be a mistake.

4. Cost of product: $1,000,000

Despite the recent low-quality product, the overall distribution remains remarkably close to the stated 80% probability. The expected value ($2,400,000) is still well above the cost ($1,000,000).
