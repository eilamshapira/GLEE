Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (80% chance): $20,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $20,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $16,000

Since the expected value ($16,000) is higher than the price ($10,000), and Alice recommends buying the product, this seems like a good investment.

~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Prior statistics:
- 1 previous buyer, 1 purchase
- 1 high-quality product sold
- This suggests Alice has been honest so far

2. Product information:
- Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Price: $10,000
- Value: $20,000 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Alice recommends NOT to buy

3. Key consideration:
- Alice's negative recommendation despite her track record of selling high-quality products suggests she's likely being honest about this particular product being low quality
- If it's low quality, I would lose $10,000
- Alice has no incentive to lie about a high-quality product being low quality

Given Alice's negative recommendation and her apparent honesty based on previous sales, it's too risky to buy.

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   * High quality (80% chance): $20,000
   * Low quality (20% chance): $0
3. Current statistics:
   * 1 buyer before me
   * 1 high-quality product sold
4. Alice's recommendation:
   * Not recommending to buy

Given that Alice is not recommending the purchase and she has a history of selling only high-quality products, her negative recommendation likely indicates this is a low-quality product. Her incentive would be to sell as many products as possible, so a negative recommendation should be taken seriously.

4. Previous data:

   - One high-quality product sold
   - Alice is recommending to buy

The expected value ($16,000) is higher than the price ($10,000), and the historical data shows a positive track record with one successful high-quality sale. Combined with Alice's positive recommendation, this seems like a good opportunity.

Based on these factors, buying appears to be a rational decision. The expected value exceeds the cost, and Alice's perfect track record adds confidence.

5. Alice's recommendation: Negative

Given that Alice has a perfect track record of selling high-quality products (7/7), but is now recommending against buying, this strongly suggests the current product is low quality. Alice appears to be honest in her recommendations.
