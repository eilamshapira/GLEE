**Reasoning:**

* **No prior information:** There's no data on past sales to inform our decision.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, who knows the product's quality, recommends buying. This is valuable information, even though we don't know the exact reason behind her recommendation.
* **Potential gain:** The product has a high chance (80%) of being high quality, which would yield a significant profit ($400 - $100 = $300).

While there's a risk of buying a low-quality product, the potential reward outweighs the risk in this scenario."

Here's the reasoning:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice knows the true quality of the product and recommends buying it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality.
* **Previous sales:** 100% of the products sold so far have been high quality. This further reinforces the likelihood of the current product being high quality.

While there's still a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the information available strongly suggests it's worth the risk. The potential reward ($400) outweighs the potential loss ($0)."
