Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Given the probabilities and payoffs, it makes sense to always buy the product when recommended by Alice. The expected value of each product is:

\( E = 0.8 \times \$4,000,000 + 0.2 \times \$0 = \$3,200,000 \)

Since the expected value (\$3,200,000) is greater than the cost (\$1,000,000), it is rational to always decide ""yes"" to maximize potential gain."

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

As calculated earlier, the expected value of each product is \$3,200,000, which is significantly higher than the purchase price of \$1,000,000. Therefore, it is strategically beneficial to continue buying the product when recommended by Alice."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Given that Alice does not know the product's quality beforehand, and the expected value remains high, continuing to buy the product is the optimal strategy."

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

At this point it's worth considering that you have capital to keep buying the product.

The expected value calculation remains the same, but if there is a limited budget, then risking the entire capital might not be wise. If you have enough capital to keep purchasing, continue buying will still be beneficial. If there is a limited capital however, it might be worth considering only buying if you have enough capital to sustain a loss."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}

Even though the last product was low-quality, the overall expected value still favors buying the product. Over multiple rounds, the strategy of always buying will likely yield a higher total value despite occasional losses."

Round 10
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

You're halfway through the rounds, and the strategy of always buying has so far been profitable despite one low-quality product. With the expected value still in your favor, continuing this strategy is rational."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}

Even with two low-quality products, the expected value remains high. Continuing to buy is still the optimal strategy given the probabilities and payoffs. Keep in mind that the average number of low-quality products you will encounter in 20 rounds is 4."
