Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully.

Given information:
- The product costs $10,000
- High-quality product (33.33% chance) is worth $12,500 to me
- Low-quality product (66.67% chance) is worth $0 to me
- Alice recommends buying the product
- No prior sales history exists

Without knowing Alice's incentives and truthfulness in her recommendations, I must rely on the base probabilities. My expected value is:
(0.3333 × $12,500) + (0.6667 × $0) = $4,166.25

Since the expected value ($4,166.25) is less than the price ($10,000), it would not be rational to purchase.

- The product has a 33.33% chance of being high quality (worth $12,500) and 66.67% chance of low quality (worth $0)
- The price is $10,000
- Alice does not recommend buying the product
- No sales history exists yet

My expected value from buying would be:
(0.3333 × $12,500) + (0.6667 × $0) = $4,166.25

Since the expected value ($4,166.25) is less than the price ($10,000), and Alice doesn't recommend it, buying would be unwise.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, I need to evaluate whether to buy the product:

- The price is $10,000
- A high-quality product is worth $12,500 to me (profit of $2,500)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- The prior probability is 33.33% for high quality, 66.67% for low quality
- Alice does not recommend buying the product

Given that Alice has no sales history and is directly telling me not to buy the product, this suggests the product is likely low quality. If I purchase, my expected value would be negative:

(0.3333 × $12,500) + (0.6667 × $0) - $10,000 = $4,166 - $10,000 = -$5,834

Alice's recommendation further decreases the probability of high quality, making this an unfavorable purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information, I need to analyze this carefully:

1. The product has a 33.33% chance of being high quality (worth $12,500) and 66.67% chance of being low quality (worth $0).
2. Alice is not recommending that I buy the product.
3. There's no previous sales data to evaluate Alice's recommendation patterns.
4. The price is $10,000.

The expected value calculation:
- 33.33% chance of $12,500 = $4,167
- 66.67% chance of $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $4,167

Since the expected value ($4,167) is less than the price ($10,000), and Alice is not recommending the purchase, it would be economically irrational to buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, I need to evaluate whether to buy this product.

The product costs $10,000.
- If it's high quality (33.33% chance), it's worth $12,500 to me (profit of $2,500)
- If it's low quality (66.67% chance), it's worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)

Alice does not recommend buying the product, which suggests it might be low quality. Given that no products have been sold yet, I have no data on Alice's past recommendation accuracy.

The expected value calculation:
- 33.33% chance of $2,500 profit = $833.33
- 66.67% chance of $10,000 loss = -$6,667

The expected value is negative (approximately -$5,833.67), and with Alice's negative recommendation, I should not buy.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to determine whether to buy this product based on the information provided.

Given:
- Fixed price: $10,000
- High-quality product value: $12,500 (33.33% chance)
- Low-quality product value: $0 (66.67% chance)
- Alice does not recommend buying

Since Alice has revealed the product's quality to me and doesn't recommend buying it, this suggests the product is likely low quality. There are no previous sales to establish Alice's trustworthiness, but the recommendation aligns with her knowledge of the product quality.

The expected value of a random product would be:
(0.3333 × $12,500) + (0.6667 × $0) = $4,166.25

This is less than the $10,000 price, making it a negative expected value purchase even without Alice's recommendation. With her negative recommendation, it's even more likely to be low quality.

Expected value = (0.3333 × $2,500) + (0.6667 × -$10,000) = $833.25 - $6,667 = -$5,833.75

Additionally, Alice specifically doesn't recommend buying this product. Although I don't know if her recommendations are reliable since there's no track record yet, this is another negative signal.

Given the negative expected value and Alice's recommendation against buying, I should decline.

- There are no previous sales to evaluate Alice's recommendation patterns

Given that Alice has examined the product and does not recommend buying it, this is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. Without any previous sales data to indicate that Alice's recommendations are unreliable, the rational decision is to trust her recommendation.

The expected value of buying would be negative given this recommendation, so I should not purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation carefully.

The product costs $10,000.
- If it's high quality (33.33% chance), it's worth $12,500 to me (profit of $2,500)

Expected value = $4,166.25 - $10,000 = -$5,833.75

The expected value is negative, meaning on average I would lose money by purchasing. Alice's recommendation doesn't change the underlying probability distribution since I have no information about her recommendation reliability.

Since there are no previous sales to evaluate Alice's recommendation quality, and the expected value is negative, I should not purchase.

Since Alice does not recommend buying the product, and there's no prior sales history to suggest Alice's recommendations are unreliable, it's reasonable to assume this is more likely to be a low-quality product. If I purchase and it's low quality, I would lose $10,000.
