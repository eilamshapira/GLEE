"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While the chance of the product being low quality is 20%,  we have the following information:

* **Alice recommends buying:** This suggests Alice has some information that indicates the product might be high quality. While not foolproof, it's a signal.
* **Previous buyer bought:** This means the first buyer also received a recommendation and decided to buy. This further strengthens the possibility of the product being high quality.

Given the potential reward of $120 and the relatively low risk, it makes sense to buy the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Given the information:

* **Previous Sales:** 2 products sold, both high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommends buying. 
* **Value:** High-quality product is worth $120, low-quality product is worth $0.

It's highly likely the product is high-quality.  Even with a 20% chance of being low quality, the potential gain of $120 outweighs the risk of losing $0.  Therefore, it's rational to buy the product."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice's recommendation is based on knowing the product's quality, and she recommends buying it, it's a safe bet to assume the product is high quality. This is further supported by the fact that all 4 previous products sold based on her recommendation were high quality. While there's always a chance of it being a low-quality product (20%), the odds are heavily in favor of it being high quality, making it a good purchase decision."

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain of a high-quality product ($120) significantly outweighs the potential loss ($0).

**Explanation:**

* **Past Sales Data:** All 10 products sold so far were high quality. This strengthens the belief that Alice is providing accurate recommendations.
