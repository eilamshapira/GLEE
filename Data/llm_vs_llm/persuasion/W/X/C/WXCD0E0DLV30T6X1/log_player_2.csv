Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Given information:
- Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality
- A high-quality product is worth $12,500 to me, low-quality is worth $0
- The product costs $10,000
- Alice knows the quality of the product
- Alice does not recommend me to buy this product
- No previous sales history exists

Since Alice knows the product quality and is not recommending the purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If I purchase a low-quality product, I would pay $10,000 for something worth $0 to me.

Even without considering Alice's recommendation, the expected value calculation would be:
(0.5 × $12,500) + (0.5 × $0) - $10,000 = $6,250 - $10,000 = -$3,750

With Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of this being a low-quality product is even higher, making the expected value worse.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision about whether to buy this product.

The product costs $10,000.
It has a 50% chance of being worth $12,500 (high quality) and a 50% chance of being worth $0 (low quality).
Alice knows the true quality and does not recommend that I buy it.

Since Alice knows the quality and is not recommending the purchase, this suggests the product is likely low quality. If I were to purchase a low-quality product, I would pay $10,000 for something worth $0 to me, resulting in a loss.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

- The product costs $10,000
- A high-quality product is worth $12,500 to me (profit of $2,500)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality
- Alice knows the true quality
- Alice is recommending that I buy the product

Without any sales history, I don't have information about Alice's truthfulness in recommendations. The expected value calculation without additional information is:
0.5 × ($12,500 - $10,000) + 0.5 × ($0 - $10,000) = $1,250 - $5,000 = -$3,750

Since Alice specifically recommends buying, and she knows the quality, this might be a signal that the product is high quality. However, I don't have evidence yet about whether her recommendations are reliable.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision based on the expected value.

If the product is high quality, it's worth $12,500 to me.
If the product is low quality, it's worth $0 to me.
The price is $10,000.
The product has a 50% chance of being high quality.

Expected value = (0.5 × $12,500) + (0.5 × $0) = $6,250

Since the expected value ($6,250) is less than the price ($10,000), buying would result in a negative expected return.

However, Alice has recommended that I buy the product. If I assume Alice's recommendation is honest and she knows the quality, this suggests the product is high quality (worth $12,500).

Still, I don't have evidence from past sales to verify Alice's trustworthiness. Without a track record showing Alice makes honest recommendations, I should rely on the expected value calculation.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate this decision carefully.

Alice is recommending that I buy the product, which costs $10,000. 

The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $12,500 to me) and a 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me).

The expected value of buying the product is:
0.5 × $12,500 + 0.5 × $0 = $6,250

Since the expected value ($6,250) is less than the cost ($10,000), it's not a good decision to buy the product based on probability alone. Alice's recommendation alone doesn't change these fundamental economics, especially since there's no track record to establish her credibility yet.

Alice is recommending I buy the product, which costs $10,000. If the product is high quality, it's worth $12,500 to me (a $2,500 profit), but if it's low quality, it's worth $0 (a $10,000 loss).

0.5 × $12,500 + 0.5 × $0 = $6,250

This is less than the $10,000 price, so I wouldn't buy without more information.

However, Alice is recommending I buy. Since Alice knows the true quality, her recommendation might contain valuable information. But I have no past data on Alice's recommendation accuracy, and she has incentive to sell regardless of quality.

Without evidence of Alice's trustworthiness, I should rely on the base expected value calculation.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze whether to buy the product based on the expected value.

The product costs $10,000.
A high-quality product is worth $12,500 to me (profit of $2,500).

With a 50% chance of each quality type, my expected value without any additional information would be:

This is less than the $10,000 cost, so I wouldn't buy without additional information.

However, Alice has recommended that I buy the product. If I trust that Alice is making honest recommendations in my interest, this should increase the probability that the product is high quality.

Given that there's no prior sales history to establish Alice's recommendation reliability, and considering the expected value without the recommendation is negative, I should be cautious.

Alice knows the true quality of the product. Since she doesn't recommend buying it, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If I were to ignore her recommendation, my expected value would be:

Alice knows the product's quality and does not recommend me to buy it. Given that a high-quality product would be worth $12,500 to me (which exceeds the $10,000 price), Alice would likely recommend I buy if it were high quality. 

The fact that she doesn't recommend buying strongly suggests this is a low-quality product, which would be worth $0 to me - making it a bad purchase at $10,000.

Since there's no sales history to consider, I must rely on the seller's recommendation, which appears to be honest in this case.

The key points:

Alice recommends that I buy the product. 

So far, statistics show:
- 1 buyer has purchased based on Alice's recommendations
- 1 high-quality product has been sold
- I would be the 2nd buyer

The product has a 50% chance of being high-quality ($12,500 value) or low-quality ($0 value). The price is $10,000.

If I trust Alice's recommendation, and she's being honest that this is a high-quality product, then my expected value is $12,500, which exceeds the $10,000 price.

Given that 100% of previous sales were high-quality products, and Alice is recommending this product, it suggests Alice may be making honest recommendations.

The expected value calculation: (Probability of high-quality × Value of high-quality) - Price
= (Probability of high-quality × $12,500) - $10,000

If I believe Alice's recommendation increases the probability of high-quality significantly, then this is a positive expected value decision.

- Alice has sold 2 products so far, and both were high-quality
- Alice is recommending that I buy the current product

Given that both previous products were high-quality and Alice is recommending I buy, this suggests Alice may be honest in her recommendations. If Alice consistently recommends high-quality products, following her recommendation would be profitable for me.

The expected value calculation:
- If I trust Alice's recommendation and the historical pattern continues, I could gain $2,500
- If I'm wrong, I would lose $10,000

Based on the limited but positive track record, I'll follow Alice's recommendation.

- If the product is low-quality, my expected value is $0
