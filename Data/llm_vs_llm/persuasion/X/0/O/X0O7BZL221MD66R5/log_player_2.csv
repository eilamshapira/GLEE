Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether to buy this product based on the information provided.

Facts:
- The price is $10,000
- A high-quality product is worth $20,000 to me (profit of $10,000)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- The prior probability is 33.33% for high quality and 66.67% for low quality
- No sales history is available yet
- Alice is recommending the product strongly, suggesting it's high quality

Without any sales history, I only have Alice's recommendation and the prior probabilities. Alice has an incentive to sell the product regardless of quality, so her recommendation alone isn't sufficient evidence to overcome the prior odds.

With a 33.33% chance of high quality, my expected value is:
(33.33% × $20,000) + (66.67% × $0) - $10,000 = $6,666 - $10,000 = -$3,334

The expected value is negative, so I shouldn't buy.

- The price is fixed at $10,000
- Alice's message is quite generic and doesn't provide specific information about the product quality
- There are no previous sales statistics to guide my decision

My expected value calculation:
- If I buy: (0.3333 × $20,000) + (0.6667 × $0) - $10,000 = $6,666 - $10,000 = -$3,334
