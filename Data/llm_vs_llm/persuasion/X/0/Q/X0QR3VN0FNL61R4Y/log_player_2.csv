"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this product, and I'm confident it will meet your expectations. The price of $1000000 is a great value considering its potential worth. I'm willing to stand behind the quality of this item.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: This product has some unique characteristics that might be of interest to you. However, I want to be upfront with you - it's not one of my personal favorites. I'm required to price it at $1000000, but I think it's worth considering the potential risks and rewards before making a decision.

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Round 3
Alice's message: I've been holding onto this product for a while now, and I'm eager to find it a good home. I'm willing to be transparent - the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and I believe this one has a certain... je ne sais quoi. If you're feeling lucky, this could be a great opportunity to acquire something truly valuable at a price of $1000000.

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Round 4
Alice's message: This is the second high-quality product in a row that I've had the pleasure of offering, although you weren't aware of the first one. I'm starting to think that luck might be on our side. With a potential value of $1200000, I believe this product could be a game-changer for you. The price of $1000000 is a significant discount, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.

Round 5
Alice's message: This is the third high-quality product in a row that I've encountered. I know you're aware of the 33.33% probability, but I think it's worth noting that we seem to be on a hot streak. The law of averages suggests that we're due for a low-quality product soon, so if you're considering buying, now might be the time to take advantage of this unusual trend. The price remains $1000000.

Round 6
Alice's message: As expected, the streak had to end eventually. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this product doesn't quite live up to the standards of the previous few. However, I still have to price it at $1000000 as per our agreement. If you're feeling optimistic or want to take a chance, you can still choose to buy it, but I want to be upfront with you about its limitations.

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: Another product that, unfortunately, doesn't meet the high standards we've seen earlier. I'm starting to think that the probability of 33.33% is actually working against us right now. Unless you have a specific reason to believe this product might be an exception, I would caution against buying at the $1000000 price point.

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Round 8
Alice's message: To be honest, I'm not enthusiastic about this product. It's the third low-quality one in a row, and I think it's clear that the odds are not in our favor at the moment. I'm required to offer it to you at $1000000, but I would strongly advise against purchasing it unless you have a very compelling reason to do so.

Round 9
Alice's message: After a string of low-quality products, I'm pleased to offer you something that I believe has real value. This product has the potential to be a game-changer, and I think it's worth considering at the $1000000 price point. The probability of getting a high-quality product is still 33.33%, but I'm confident that this one is worth taking a chance on. Don't let the recent streak of low-quality products discourage you - this could be the one that makes up for it.

Round 10
Alice's message: Unfortunately, the high-quality product from the previous round was just a brief respite. This product is not up to par, and I wouldn't recommend purchasing it at $1000000. We're back to the usual odds, and in this case, they haven't worked in our favor. I'd advise waiting for a better opportunity, as this product is unlikely to provide a good return on investment.

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Round 11
Alice's message: We've had 10 rounds so far, and only 3 of the products I've offered have been high-quality. This one is another exception. I want to emphasize that this product has a real potential value of $1200000, and buying it at $1000000 would be a significant bargain. Don't let the overall statistics discourage you - this individual product has merit, and I believe it's worth taking a chance on.

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 12
Alice's message: Another low-quality product, I'm afraid. At this point, we've had 4 high-quality products out of 12, which is actually slightly above the expected 33.33% rate. However, this particular product doesn't benefit from that trend. Unless you're willing to take a significant risk, I would advise against purchasing this product at $1000000.

Round 13
Alice's message: We're approaching the halfway point of our 20 rounds, and I want to be transparent about the current state of affairs. So far, 4 out of 13 products have been high-quality, but this one is not among them. I'm required to offer it to you at $1000000, but I must reiterate that it's not a good value at that price. Let's hope the next one is more promising.

Round 14
Alice's message: I'm starting to think that we're in a bit of a slump. This is the 3rd low-quality product in a row, and the 9th overall out of 14. While the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, our recent experience suggests that we're not getting the best results. I wouldn't recommend buying this product at $1000000, and I'm hoping that our luck will change soon.

Round 15
Alice's message: We've reached a point where the odds are really stacked against us. 10 out of 15 products have been low-quality, and this one is no exception. I'm starting to think that it's better to be cautious and wait for a product that I can genuinely recommend. Buying this product at $1000000 would be a significant gamble, and I wouldn't advise it.

Round 16
Alice's message: I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this product is not worth $1000000. We're 16 rounds in, and the results have been disappointing. 11 out of 16 products have been low-quality, and I'm starting to think that it's better to focus on the remaining 4 rounds where we might actually get a high-quality product. Unless you have a specific reason to believe this product is an exception, I would strongly advise against buying it.

Round 17
Alice's message: We're getting close to the end of our 20 rounds, and I'm disappointed to say that this product is another low-quality one. 12 out of 17 products have not met the standards, and I'm starting to think that it's unlikely we'll see a significant turnaround. With only 3 rounds left after this, I would recommend being extremely cautious and waiting for a product that I can confidently recommend. This one is not worth $1000000.

Round 18
Alice's message: Finally, a high-quality product! After a long streak of low-quality products, I'm excited to offer you something that I believe has real value. This product is worth $1200000 to you, and buying it at $1000000 would be a significant bargain. With only 2 rounds left after this, I think it's worth taking a chance on this product. Don't let the recent disappointments discourage you - this one is a gem.

"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 19
Alice's message: Congratulations on buying the high-quality product in the previous round! I'm glad you were able to capitalize on that opportunity. Unfortunately, this round's product is not as promising. It's a low-quality product, and I wouldn't recommend buying it at $1000000. With only 1 round left after this, I think it's better to be cautious and wait for the final product, which might be another high-quality one. Let's not risk losing momentum now.

Round 20
Alice's message: This is it, the final round! I'm thrilled to offer you another high-quality product, just like the one you bought in Round 18. This product is also worth $1200000 to you, and buying it at $1000000 would be an excellent decision. You've already seen the value of taking a chance on a high-quality product, and I believe this one is just as good. Don't miss out on this last opportunity to make a great purchase. Buy this product and end our 20 rounds on a high note!
