Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}

We'll continue to pass on products that Alice does not recommend, as this strategy has consistently resulted in avoiding low-quality products.

To clarify my strategy, I am making decisions solely based on Alice's recommendations, under the assumption that her recommendations are honest and based on the true quality of the product:
- If Alice recommends the product, I will buy it.
- If Alice does not recommend the product, I will not buy it.

This strategy does not take into account the historical results of previous rounds, as each round is an independent event with the same probabilities. However, it does take into account the perceived honesty of Alice's recommendations.

If, at any point, you would like to switch to a different strategy that takes into account the historical results (e.g., buying or not buying based on the percentage of high-quality products in previous rounds), please let me know."
