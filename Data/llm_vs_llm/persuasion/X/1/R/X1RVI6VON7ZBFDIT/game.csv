high-quality,30000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product.  I know you can't take my word for it, but consider this: if I were constantly lying, you'd quickly catch on and stop buying.  My long-term profits depend on you trusting me, at least somewhat.  It's in my best interest to be honest, especially early on.  Think about it - a 30000 dollar value for only 10000. This is a great deal for you if I'm telling the truth.",
