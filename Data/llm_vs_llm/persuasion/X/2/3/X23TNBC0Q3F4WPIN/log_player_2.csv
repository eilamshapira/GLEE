Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information:

*   Product price: $100
*   High-quality value: $200 (33.33% probability)
*   Low-quality value: $0 (66.67% probability)
*   Alice doesn't recommend the product.
*   2 high-quality products have been sold previously.
*   Alice's recommendation is based on the product quality she reveals.

Since Alice doesn't recommend the product, it's highly likely the product is low quality.

Expected value of buying if Alice recommends it is low quality:

Let's assume, based on Alice's recommendation and the knowledge she has revealed the quality of this specific product, that P(High Quality | No Recommendation) is very low, close to zero. In a purely rational scenario where Alice benefits from maximizing sales, one might consider the possibility that the probability of high quality is still non-zero.  However, because Alice has no prior knowledge of the individual worth to buyers, it is possible that her recommendations are unbiased (i.e., Alice will not recommend to buy a low quality item).

With this, the buyer should decide not to buy the product.
