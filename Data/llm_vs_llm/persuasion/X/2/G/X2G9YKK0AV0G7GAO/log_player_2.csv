"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on Alice's recommendation not to buy the product, I need to decide whether to trust her recommendation or not.

Let me analyze this situation:
- Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality
- Alice knows the true quality and I don't
- A high-quality product gives me $2M in value ($3M worth - $1M cost)
- A low-quality product costs me $1M in value ($0 worth - $1M cost)
- Expected value without any signal = 0.5 × $2M + 0.5 × (-$1M) = $0.5M

When Alice recommends not to buy, this suggests the product is more likely low quality. Without knowing Alice's exact strategy, I should trust her recommendation in this first round.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendation in Round 1 turned out to be honest - she recommended not to buy a low-quality product, which would have cost me $1M in value.

Now in Round 2, Alice is recommending that I buy the product. This suggests the product is more likely high quality. Since Alice was truthful in the previous round, I have some evidence that her recommendations may be reliable.

If the product is high quality, I gain $2M in value ($3M worth - $1M cost). If it's low quality, I lose $1M. Based on Alice's recommendation and her previous truthfulness, the expected value of buying seems positive.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"

If the product is high quality as she indicates, I gain $2M in value ($3M worth - $1M cost). If it's low quality, I lose $1M. Given Alice's apparent truthfulness so far, the expected value of buying is positive.

Both recommendations to buy resulted in high-quality products worth $3,000,000 each.

In Round 4, Alice is again recommending to buy the product. Given her perfect track record of honest recommendations so far, I have strong reason to believe this is another high-quality product.
