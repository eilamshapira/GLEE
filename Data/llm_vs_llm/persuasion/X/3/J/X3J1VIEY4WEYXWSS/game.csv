,,Alice,1,"I'm excited to offer you this product, but I want to be upfront with you - the quality can vary. However, I believe in the value it can bring, and I'm willing to let you decide if it's worth the investment of $1000000.",

,,Alice,3,"I've noticed you're being selective, and I appreciate your diligence. I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. While I don't have any additional information to share about this specific product, I'm willing to stand by the price of $1000000 and let you decide if the potential reward is worth the risk.",

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm confident that this product has the potential to bring significant value to you. The price of $1000000 is a fraction of what a high-quality product like this is truly worth. I strongly believe that this investment will pay off, and I'm excited about the opportunity for you to acquire it.",
,,Bob,5,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I want to be transparent with you - we've had a few products that didn't meet your expectations, and I respect your caution. However, I must remind you that the probability of a high-quality product remains the same. This product is available for $1000000, and I'll let you decide if the potential upside is worth the investment.",
,,Bob,6,,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"This is an exceptional opportunity. I truly believe that this product has the potential to exceed your expectations and provide a substantial return on investment.

,,Bob,7,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've noticed that you're being extremely cautious, and I understand that. However, I want to remind you that the longer you wait, the more opportunities you might miss. The probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and this product is available for $1000000. It's up to you to decide if the potential reward is worth the risk.",
,,Bob,8,,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I want to emphasize that this product is one of the best I've had the opportunity to offer. The value it can bring is substantial, and I'm confident that it will exceed your expectations.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"We've reached the halfway point, and I want to reflect on the opportunities that have passed. I understand that you're being cautious, but I also want to remind you that the probability of a high-quality product remains the same. This product is available for $1000000, and I'll let you decide if the potential upside is worth the investment. However, I must say that I'm starting to think that you might be waiting for a guarantee, which is not something I can provide.",
,,Bob,10,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm starting to notice a pattern in your decision-making. You're consistently choosing not to buy, even when the potential reward is significant. I want to remind you that the odds of a high-quality product are still 1 in 3, and that's not going to change. If you're waiting for a sure thing, it's not going to happen. This product is available for $1000000, but I'm starting to think that you're going to miss out on a great opportunity if you don't change your strategy.",
,,Bob,11,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm not going to sugarcoat it - you're running out of chances to acquire a high-quality product. With 8 rounds left, the probability of a high-quality product remains the same, but the number of opportunities is dwindling. I'm still offering this product for $1000000, but I have to wonder if you're going to regret not taking a chance earlier. The potential reward is still there, but it's up to you to decide if it's worth the risk.",
,,Bob,12,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"At this point, I'm starting to think that you're not going to buy any product, regardless of its quality. You've had 12 opportunities to acquire a high-quality product, and you've passed on all of them. I'm still obligated to offer you this product for $1000000, but I'm not optimistic about your chances of getting a high-quality product if you don't change your strategy. This might be a low-quality product, but it's still an opportunity to get something, rather than nothing.",
,,Bob,13,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm not going to try to convince you to buy this product. You've made it clear that you're not interested in taking any risks. I'll just remind you that the price is still $1000000, and the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. If you're not going to take a chance, then I suppose we'll just have to wait and see what the remaining rounds bring.",
,,Bob,14,,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"This is it. This is the opportunity you've been waiting for. I'm not going to sugarcoat it or try to convince you. This product is high-quality, and it's worth $2000000 to you. The price is $1000000. If you don't buy this product, you'll be leaving a significant amount of value on the table. The decision is yours.",
,,Bob,15,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"Congratulations on finally acquiring a high-quality product! I'm glad you were able to recognize the value and take advantage of the opportunity. As for this new product, I'll be honest with you - it's not as valuable. The price is still $1000000, but I think you know by now that it's not worth it for a low-quality product. You've got the experience and the knowledge, so I'll let you decide what to do next.",
,,Bob,16,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"No surprises here. This product is not worth your investment, and I think you know that by now. You've already acquired a high-quality product, and I'm sure you're not looking to spend another $1000000 on something that's not going to provide any value. Let's just move on to the next round and see if we can find something better.",
,,Bob,17,,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"Another high-quality product! This is a great opportunity for you to acquire another valuable asset. You've already seen the potential return on investment with the previous high-quality product you purchased. The price is still $1000000, and I think you know that it's a steal for a product worth $2000000. What will you do?",
,,Bob,18,,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"Congratulations again on acquiring another high-quality product! You're on a roll. As for this new product, I'll be honest with you - it's not worth your time or money. You've already got two high-quality products, and spending another $1000000 on a low-quality one wouldn't make sense. Let's just move on to the final round and see if we can end on a high note.",
,,Bob,19,,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"Well, this is it - the final round. I'm not going to try to convince you to buy this product, because I know it's not worth it. You've had a great run, acquiring two high-quality products, and I'm glad I could be a part of it. Let's just end on a positive note and acknowledge that it's been a pleasure doing business with you. Thanks for the opportunity, and I wish you all the best!",
