Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $2M) and 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0)
2. The price is $1M
3. Alice doesn't recommend buying
4. There's no previous sales history to base additional information on
5. If Alice is being honest, her recommendation against buying suggests this might be a low-quality product

Given that Alice is actively recommending against the purchase and there's no track record to evaluate her trustworthiness, it would be risky to go against her recommendation. The safest choice would be to decline.

"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The base probability is 50% for high quality ($2M value) and 50% for low quality ($0 value)
2. The price is $1M
3. Alice doesn't recommend buying
4. There's no previous sales history to learn from

Since Alice has no incentive to lie (she gets the same $1M either way), her recommendation against buying likely means this is a low-quality product. While there's still uncertainty, it's rational to trust her recommendation since she has perfect information about the quality.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Product price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value: 
   - 50% chance of $2,000,000 (high quality)
   - 50% chance of $0 (low quality)
3. Expected value = (0.5 × $2,000,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $1,000,000
4. Alice recommends buying
5. No previous sales history to verify Alice's trustworthiness

The expected value equals the price, and while Alice recommends buying, there's no historical data to verify her credibility. However, since the expected value matches the price and there's no indication of dishonesty, it's a reasonable risk to take.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality: $2,000,000 (50% chance)
   - Low quality: $0 (50% chance)
3. Previous statistics:
   - 1 buyer purchased
   - 1 high-quality product sold
4. Alice's recommendation: Negative

Alice's track record shows she's been honest before (1 high-quality sale), but she's now recommending against buying. Given that she's been truthful previously and is explicitly recommending against the purchase, this strongly suggests the current product is low quality.

A negative recommendation from a seller who has demonstrated honesty is a strong signal that we should avoid the purchase.

2. Current situation:

- Potential gain: $2,000,000 (if high quality)
- Potential loss: $1,000,000 (if low quality)
- Alice's recommendation history appears trustworthy

1. Alice has no incentive to lie (she gets the same $1M regardless)
2. She's been honest so far (100% high quality sales)
3. She's explicitly saying not to buy

Her negative recommendation likely means this is a low-quality product. If so, I would lose $1M as it would be worth $0 to me.

Since Alice is recommending against buying and has shown honesty in previous transactions, it's likely this is a low-quality product which would result in a loss of $1,000,000.

3. Key considerations:
- Alice's perfect track record is promising
- Her recommendation carries weight given her accurate history
- The expected value equals the cost, but Alice's recommendation tips the scales positively
