"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this decision.

- Alice recommends buying the product
- The price is $1,000,000
- If high quality (80% chance), it's worth $3,000,000 to me
- If low quality (20% chance), it's worth $0 to me

Expected value if I buy:
(0.8 × $3,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) - $1,000,000 = $2,400,000 - $1,000,000 = $1,400,000

Since the expected value is positive, it's rational for me to buy.

Round 7
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this decision carefully.

- Alice does NOT recommend buying the product
- The price is $1,000,000
- If high quality (80% chance), it's worth $3,000,000 to me
- If low quality (20% chance), it's worth $0 to me

This is interesting - Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase. Given that Alice knows the true value and has chosen not to recommend it, this strongly suggests the product is low quality.

If I assume Alice is being truthful with her recommendation, then the probability of the product being high quality is much lower than the base rate of 80%.

Based on Alice's lack of recommendation, I should not buy this product.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this decision.

- Alice does NOT recommend buying the product
- The price is $1,000,000
- If high quality (80% chance), it's worth $3,000,000 to me
- If low quality (20% chance), it's worth $0 to me

In the previous round, Alice didn't recommend buying, and indeed the product was low quality. This suggests Alice is being truthful in her recommendations.

Given that Alice knows the true quality and is choosing not to recommend this product, it's reasonable to conclude this product is likely low quality. If I were to buy it, I would lose my $1,000,000 investment.

I'll trust Alice's recommendation again.

- The price is $1,000,000
- If high quality (80% chance), it's worth $3,000,000 to me
