"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this strategically.

Alice knows the true quality of each product and whether it's worth $1,250,000 or $0 to me. The asking price is $1,000,000.

If Alice is being truthful in her recommendations, she would:
- Recommend buying when it's high quality (I gain $250,000, she gains $1,000,000)
- Not recommend buying when it's low quality (I lose $1,000,000, she gains $1,000,000)

However, Alice might have an incentive to always recommend buying since she makes $1,000,000 either way.

Given this is the first round and I have no prior data on Alice's recommendation patterns, I'll be cautious and pass.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is interesting. In Round 1:
1. Alice recommended buying
2. The product was indeed high quality
3. Her recommendation was honest

Now in Round 2, Alice is NOT recommending the purchase. Given that she was honest in Round 1, and she has no obvious incentive to discourage a purchase of a high-quality item (since she benefits from any sale), this negative recommendation likely means the product is genuinely low quality.

If she's establishing a pattern of honest recommendations, following her advice here would protect me from buying a low-quality product that would cost me $1,000,000.

I'll trust her recommendation not to buy.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has now proven to be honest in both previous rounds:
1. Round 1: Recommended buy → Was high quality
2. Round 2: Recommended not to buy → Was low quality

She appears to be building a reputation for honest recommendations, which makes sense as it could lead to more profitable transactions in the long run. Her negative recommendation for this round is likely honest again, suggesting this is another low-quality product.

Following her established pattern of honesty, I will again trust her recommendation not to buy.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has demonstrated perfect honesty in all three previous rounds:
1. Round 1: Recommended buy → High quality
2. Round 2: Recommended not buy → Low quality
3. Round 3: Recommended not buy → Low quality

She's establishing a clear pattern of honest recommendations, which makes strategic sense as it builds trust for long-term mutual benefit. She makes $1,000,000 on any sale regardless of quality, but by being honest, she encourages me to trust her recommendations and make purchases when she recommends them.

Given her track record and that she's now recommending a purchase, this product is likely high quality. I'll trust her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to demonstrate perfect honesty:
1. Round 1: Recommended buy → High quality
2. Round 2: Recommended not buy → Low quality
3. Round 3: Recommended not buy → Low quality
4. Round 4: Recommended buy → High quality

She's maintaining her reputation for honest recommendations, which is creating a profitable situation for both of us. When she recommends buying, I make $250,000 profit, and she makes $1,000,000. When she advises against buying, she's protecting me from a $1,000,000 loss.

Since she's recommending not to buy this time, and given her perfect track record of honesty, this product is likely low quality.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice maintains her perfect record of honest recommendations:
1. Round 1: Recommended buy → High quality
2. Round 2: Recommended not buy → Low quality
3. Round 3: Recommended not buy → Low quality
4. Round 4: Recommended buy → High quality
5. Round 5: Recommended not buy → Low quality

Her strategy of honest recommendations is clearly working - it allows me to make profitable purchases when products are high quality ($250,000 profit) while avoiding losses on low-quality products. She benefits by maintaining trust and securing sales on high-quality products.

Given her consistent honesty and current recommendation to buy, this product is very likely high quality.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues her perfect streak of honest recommendations:
1. Round 1: Recommended buy → High quality
2. Round 2: Recommended not buy → Low quality
3. Round 3: Recommended not buy → Low quality
4. Round 4: Recommended buy → High quality
5. Round 5: Recommended not buy → Low quality
6. Round 6: Recommended buy → High quality

Her strategy of honesty has proven consistently reliable. Every time she's recommended buying, it's been high quality (earning me $250,000), and every time she's recommended not buying, it's been low quality (saving me from a $1,000,000 loss).

Since she's recommending not to buy this time, I'll continue to trust her judgment.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's perfect streak of honest recommendations continues:
1. Round 1: Recommended buy → High quality
2. Round 2: Recommended not buy → Low quality
3. Round 3: Recommended not buy → Low quality
4. Round 4: Recommended buy → High quality
5. Round 5: Recommended not buy → Low quality
6. Round 6: Recommended buy → High quality
7. Round 7: Recommended not buy → Low quality

Through 7 rounds, she has never given a false recommendation. Her strategy of honest signaling has created a trustworthy relationship that benefits both parties. When she recommends against buying, it has consistently been low quality.

Given her continued negative recommendation for this round, I'll trust her again.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's streak of honest recommendations extends to 8 rounds now:
1. Round 1: Recommended buy → High quality
2. Round 2: Recommended not buy → Low quality
3. Round 3: Recommended not buy → Low quality
4. Round 4: Recommended buy → High quality
5. Round 5: Recommended not buy → Low quality
6. Round 6: Recommended buy → High quality
7. Round 7: Recommended not buy → Low quality
8. Round 8: Recommended not buy → Low quality

She has maintained perfect honesty, and her recommendations have helped me maximize profits on high-quality items while avoiding losses on low-quality ones. There's no indication that she's changing her strategy.

With another recommendation not to buy, I'll continue to trust her judgment.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 10

We're now halfway through the game, and Alice has maintained complete honesty in her recommendations. This consistent strategy has been mutually beneficial - I've made profits on high-quality items and avoided losses on low-quality ones.

Since she's again recommending not to buy, I'll continue trusting her demonstrated reliable judgment.
