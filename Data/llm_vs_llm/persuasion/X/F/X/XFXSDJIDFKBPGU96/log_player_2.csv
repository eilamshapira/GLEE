"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make a decision, I need to analyze the expected value of buying this product given Alice's recommendation.

Alice does not recommend buying the product. This gives me additional information beyond the base 80% chance of high quality. Since Alice is the seller and would earn $1,000,000 from a sale, her recommendation against buying suggests she might be honest about a low-quality product.

Expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 
  * Cost: $1,000,000
  * If high quality (less likely given the recommendation): Gain $3,000,000
  * If low quality (more likely given the recommendation): Gain $0
  * Without knowing Alice's exact strategy, her negative recommendation likely means the product is low quality

Given Alice's recommendation against buying, the probability of this being a high-quality product is likely significantly lower than the base 80%. The expected value is therefore likely negative.
