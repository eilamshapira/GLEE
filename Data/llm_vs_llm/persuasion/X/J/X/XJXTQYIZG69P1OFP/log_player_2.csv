"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this strategically.

Since Alice knows the true quality of each product and knows what they're worth to me, I need to consider her incentives:
- If she recommends a high-quality product ($120 value), and I buy it for $100, we both benefit
- If she recommends a low-quality product ($0 value), and I buy it for $100, only she benefits

At this stage, I don't know if Alice is being truthful or strategic. The base expected value without any information would be:
(50% × $120) + (50% × $0) - $100 = -$40

Even with her recommendation, without knowing her strategy pattern yet, I should be cautious in this first round.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $120 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Interesting - in Round 1, Alice was truthful in recommending a high-quality product. This suggests she might be using an honest strategy rather than trying to deceive me.

If she's being consistently honest, following her recommendation would be profitable because:
- When she recommends buying, it's likely high quality ($120 value)
- By not buying in Round 1, I missed out on a $20 profit

Given that she's recommending again, and she proved honest in Round 1, I'll trust her recommendation this time.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $120 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is an interesting development:
1. Round 1: Alice recommended truthfully (high quality)
2. Round 2: Alice recommended truthfully again (high quality)
3. Now she's explicitly NOT recommending the product

So far, Alice has been honest with her recommendations, and now she's actively telling me not to buy. This strongly suggests:
1. She's using an honest strategy
2. The current product is likely low quality ($0 value)

Following her recommendations has been profitable so far, and now she's warning me away. I should trust her negative recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The pattern is becoming very clear:
1. Round 1: Recommended high quality (truthful)
2. Round 2: Recommended high quality (truthful)
3. Round 3: Did not recommend low quality (truthful)
4. Now: Not recommending again

Alice has demonstrated a perfectly honest pattern so far:
- When she recommends buying, the product is high quality ($120 value)
- When she recommends not buying, the product is low quality ($0 value)

Since she's not recommending this product, and she's been consistently honest, I should trust her again and not buy.

Since she's not recommending this product, and she has proven to be consistently truthful, I should continue to trust her judgment.
