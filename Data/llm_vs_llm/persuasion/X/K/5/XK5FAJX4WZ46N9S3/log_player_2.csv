1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality (50%): $12,500
   - Low quality (50%): $0
3. Expected value: (0.5 × $12,500) + (0.5 × $0) = $6,250
4. Alice doesn't recommend buying
5. No previous sales data to reference

Given that:
- The expected value ($6,250) is less than the price ($10,000)
- The seller is not recommending the purchase
- There's no historical data to validate seller's credibility

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. The product costs $10,000
2. If it's high quality, I gain $12,500 (profit of $2,500)
3. If it's low quality, I gain $0 (loss of $10,000)
4. Base probability is 50/50
5. Alice doesn't recommend buying
6. No previous sales history to reference

Given that Alice doesn't recommend buying and has nothing to lose by being honest (since there's no previous reputation to maintain), this is likely a low-quality product. The negative recommendation combined with the significant potential loss ($10,000) versus the modest potential gain ($2,500) makes this a risky purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50%): $12,500
   - Low quality (50%): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (50% × $12,500) + (50% × $0) = $6,250

4. Considerations:
   - No previous sales history to guide the decision
   - Alice's recommendation could be strategic
   - Expected value ($6,250) is less than the price ($10,000)

Since the expected value ($6,250) is lower than the asking price ($10,000), it would not be rational to buy the product.

3. If low quality, it's worth $0 (loss of $10,000)
4. The seller is not recommending the purchase
5. There's no prior history to base additional judgment on

Given that Alice has full information about the product's quality and is not recommending the purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If it were high quality, Alice would likely recommend it to make the sale.

While the base probability is 50/50, Alice's recommendation significantly updates my belief toward it being low quality, where I would lose $10,000.

Given that Alice knows the true quality and recommends buying, this might be a positive signal. However, we don't yet know Alice's incentives or trustworthiness as there's no sales history.

Expected value calculation:

- 50% chance of $10,000 loss = -$5,000
Base expected value = -$3,750

Even with Alice's recommendation, without any track record to establish trust, the potential loss ($10,000) is significantly larger than the potential gain ($2,500).

The expected value without considering Alice's recommendation would be:

This is already below the $10,000 price.

Adding Alice's negative recommendation makes this an even clearer decision.
