low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Welcome! I've sold three products so far, and my most recent sale was a success.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Hello! I've sold six products so far, but I want to caution you that my sales history might not accurately reflect the quality of this product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"Welcome! I've sold seven products so far, but I want to remind you that my recent sales don't necessarily mean I'm on a hot streak. In fact, the law of averages might be working against me. Each product is independent, and the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. I'm offering this new one to you for $100.

,,Alice,15,"Welcome! I've sold ten products so far, and while I've had some recent successes, my last sale was actually a low-quality product. I'm offering this new one to you for $100. Keep in mind that each product is independent, and the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I want to be transparent with you - my last two products were not of the highest quality, so it's possible that I'm in a slump.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"Hello! I've sold eleven products so far, and I have to admit that my recent sales haven't been the best in terms of quality.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"Welcome! I've sold twelve products so far, and I have to be honest with you, my recent sales have been underwhelming in terms of quality. My last four products were not of the highest quality, and it's starting to look like a trend. However, I still believe that each product is independent, and the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. I'm offering this new one to you for $100.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"Welcome! I've sold fourteen products so far, and I have to admit that my recent sales have been a disaster in terms of quality. My last six products were not of the highest quality, and it's starting to look like I've lost my touch. However, I still want to remind you that each product is independent, and the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. But, I have to be honest with you, the trend is not looking good. I'm offering this new one to you for $100. If you're a true believer in the law of averages, or if you just want to take a wild chance, you can buy it and discover its quality later.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"Hello! I've sold fifteen products so far, and I'm afraid my recent sales have been a complete catastrophe in terms of quality. My last seven products were not of the highest quality, and it's clear that I'm in a slump. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, the trend is terrible, and it's unlikely that this product will be any different. However, I still have to offer it to you for $100, and I want to remind you that each product is independent, and the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. But, let's be real, it's a long shot. If you're a glutton for punishment, or if you just want to see if I can break the streak, you can buy it and find out its quality later.",
