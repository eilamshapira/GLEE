Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully.

Given information:
- Product price: $1,000,000
- High-quality product chance: 80%
- High-quality product value to me: $3,000,000
- Low-quality product value to me: $0
- Alice recommends buying the product
- No previous sales history

The expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of getting $3,000,000 value = $2,400,000
- 20% chance of getting $0 value = $0
- Total expected value = $2,400,000
- Cost = $1,000,000
- Expected profit = $2,400,000 - $1,000,000 = $1,400,000

Since the expected profit is positive and substantial, even without considering Alice's recommendation, it makes sense to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation:

- The product costs $1,000,000
- High-quality product (80% chance) is worth $3,000,000 to me
- Low-quality product (20% chance) is worth $0 to me
- Alice recommended I buy the product
- 1 previous buyer purchased based on Alice's recommendation, and that product was high-quality

Given that Alice knows the true quality and has recommended I buy, and her previous recommendation resulted in a high-quality purchase, this suggests her recommendations may be reliable. 

The expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of $3,000,000 value = $2,400,000
- 20% chance of $0 value = $0
- Total expected value = $2,400,000

- Low-quality product value: $0 (20% chance)
- Alice has recommended 2 products to previous buyers, and both were high-quality
- Alice is recommending that I buy this product

The expected value of a random product is:
0.8 × $3,000,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $2,400,000

Since $2,400,000 > $1,000,000, buying would be profitable in the long run.

Furthermore, Alice has a perfect track record so far (2 out of 2 high-quality products sold), and she's recommending this product to me, which suggests it's likely high quality.

Given information:
- Each product has an 80% chance of being high quality
- A high-quality product is worth $3,000,000 to me
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me
- The price is $1,000,000
- Alice recommends I buy the product
- 3 previous buyers purchased products on Alice's recommendation
- All 3 products sold were high quality

Expected value calculation:
If I trust the prior probability: 0.8 × $3,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $1,400,000

The fact that Alice's recommendations have led to 3 high-quality products being sold suggests her recommendations are reliable. This increases my confidence beyond the base 80% probability.

Given Alice's perfect track record of recommendations so far and the positive expected value, buying seems like the rational choice.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this decision:

1) The product costs $1,000,000
2) If high quality, it's worth $3,000,000 to me (profit of $2,000,000)
3) If low quality, it's worth $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
4) The base probability is 80% high quality, 20% low quality
5) Alice has sold 4 products so far, all high quality
6) Alice recommends I buy this product

Given that Alice has perfect information about product quality and has honestly sold only high-quality products so far, combined with her recommendation to buy, this strongly suggests the current product is high quality.

The expected value calculation supports this:
- 80% chance of $2,000,000 profit = $1,600,000
- 20% chance of $1,000,000 loss = -$200,000
- Net expected value = $1,400,000

- Alice has sold 5 products, all high-quality
- Alice recommends I buy the product

Expected value calculation:
- If I trust the prior probability: 0.8 × $3,000,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $2,400,000
- Since the price is $1,000,000, this would be a profitable purchase on average

Additional considerations:
- Alice's perfect track record (5/5 high-quality products sold) suggests her recommendations may be reliable
- Alice knows the true quality of the product and has chosen to recommend it
- Alice has incentive to sell regardless of quality, but the perfect track record is encouraging

Given these factors, it seems reasonable to purchase the product.

- Alice is recommending I buy this product

The expected value calculation:
0.8 × $3,000,000 + 0.2 × $0 = $2,400,000

The expected value calculation:

Expected value calculation:
If 7 out of 8 previous products were high quality, this suggests Alice's recommendations are generally reliable. The expected value of buying is:

Looking at Alice's track record, 8 out of 9 products sold were high quality (about 89%), which is better than the base rate of 80%. Alice is now recommending I buy the product, which is a positive signal.

The expected value calculation:

If Alice is truthful in her recommendations, and she's recommending I buy, this increases the likelihood that the product is high-quality. The track record of 90% high-quality products in previous sales also exceeds the base rate of 80%.

Alice is now recommending that I buy the current product. Given her track record and the fact that her recommendation success rate exceeds the base rate, there's good reason to trust her recommendation.
