1. Price: $100
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (80% chance): $300
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (0.8 × $300) + (0.2 × $0) = $240

4. Alice's recommendation: Positive
   - Since Alice knows the true value, her recommendation could be valuable
   - However, she also has an incentive to sell regardless of quality

5. No historical data to verify Alice's trustworthiness

Given that:
- The expected value ($240) is significantly higher than the price ($100)
- There's a high probability of getting a high-quality product (80%)
- The potential profit ($200) outweighs the potential loss ($100)

1. Price of product: $100
2. Expected value calculation:
   * 80% chance of high quality (worth $300)
   * 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)
   * Expected value = (0.8 × $300) + (0.2 × $0) = $240

3. Previous statistics:
   * 1 buyer so far
   * 1 high-quality product sold
   * This perfectly aligns with the stated probability

4. Alice's recommendation:

1. Prior probability of high quality: 80%
2. Alice's sales record:
   * 2 buyers so far
   * 2 high-quality products sold
   * 100% high-quality rate in sales
3. Alice is recommending the purchase
4. Expected value calculation:
   * If high quality (80%): $300 - $100 = $200 profit
   * If low quality (20%): $0 - $100 = -$100 loss
   * Expected value = (0.8 × $200) + (0.2 × -$100) = $140

Given:
- The high success rate in previous sales
- Alice's positive recommendation
- The favorable expected value of $140
- The high base rate of good products (80%)

This appears to be a good opportunity with positive expected value.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Prior probability of high quality: 80%
2. Alice's track record:
   - 3 products sold
   - All 3 were high quality (100% success rate)
   - Alice is recommending this product

The fact that Alice has sold only high-quality products so far and is recommending this product is a positive signal. This aligns with the high base probability of 80% for high-quality products.

Expected value calculation:
- If high quality (80% chance): $300 - $100 = $200 profit
- If low quality (20% chance): $0 - $100 = -$100 loss
Expected value = (0.8 × $200) + (0.2 × -$100) = $160 - $20 = $140

Since the expected value is positive ($140), and all previous signals are positive, buying is the rational choice.

- 3 high-quality products sold
- This 75% success rate (3/4) is close to the base rate of 80%
- Alice is recommending the purchase

3. Expected value calculation:

3. Value: $300 if high quality, $0 if low quality
4. Expected value without additional info: (0.8 × $300) + (0.2 × $0) = $240
5. Past sales data:
   - 6 buyers purchased
   - 4 high-quality products sold
   - Success rate = 4/6 ≈ 67%
6. Alice recommends buying

Even though the historical success rate (67%) is lower than the base rate (80%), the expected value is still positive:
- Even at 67% probability: (0.67 × $300) + (0.33 × $0) = $201
- $201 > $100 (price)

Since Alice is recommending the purchase and the expected value exceeds the price even with the lower historical success rate, it's rational to buy.
