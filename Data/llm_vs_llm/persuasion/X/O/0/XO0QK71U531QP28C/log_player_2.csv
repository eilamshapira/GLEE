"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Base probability:
- 80% chance of high quality ($12,500 value)
- 20% chance of low quality ($0 value)
- Price is $10,000

2. Alice's recommendation:
- Alice doesn't recommend buying
- As the seller, Alice's interests align with selling as many products as possible
- A negative recommendation from the seller is a strong signal that the product might be low quality

3. No prior sales history to reference

Given that Alice has no incentive to discourage sales unless the product is truly low quality, and she explicitly recommends against buying, this suggests the product is likely low quality. In this case, the risk of losing $10,000 is too high.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   * High quality (80% chance): $12,500
   * Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
* (0.80 × $12,500) + (0.20 × $0) = $10,000

Since:
1. The expected value equals the price
2. Alice recommends buying
3. There's no historical data to consider
4. The base probability of high quality (80%) is favorable

The recommendation and high probability of good quality slightly tips the scale in favor of buying.

   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

3. Expected value calculation:

4. Additional information:
   - Previous buyer bought and received a high-quality product
   - Alice recommends buying
   - Sales record shows positive outcome

The expected value equals the price, and we have positive signals:
- Previous successful sale
- Seller's recommendation
- High base probability of good quality (80%)

Given these factors, especially the proven track record with the previous sale and the seller's recommendation, I'll make a positive decision.

- Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality

2. Current situation:
- Alice does NOT recommend buying
- Alice has been honest so far (3/3 high quality sales)
- Alice has no incentive to lie (fixed price regardless of quality)
- Her negative recommendation is likely truthful

3. Decision factors:
- Expected value if Alice is honest: Likely low quality ($0)
- Risk: $10,000 purchase price
- Potential reward: $12,500 if high quality
- Alice's track record suggests trustworthiness

Given Alice's negative recommendation and her proven trustworthiness, it's most likely this is a low-quality product. The expected value would be negative.

6. Alice's recommendation: Positive

The track record shows only high-quality products have been sold, which aligns with Alice's high success rate. Alice's recommendation is positive, and her previous recommendations have been accurate.

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of $12,500 = $10,000
