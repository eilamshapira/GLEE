Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (50%): $40,000
   - Low quality (50%): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (50% × $40,000) + (50% × $0) = $20,000

4. Considerations:
   - No previous sales history to evaluate Alice's credibility
   - Alice recommends buying
   - Expected value ($20,000) is higher than the price ($10,000)

Since the expected value ($20,000) is twice the asking price ($10,000), even with no previous sales history, this is a positive expected value decision.

1. Previous statistics:
- 1 buyer before me
- 1 purchase made
- 1 high-quality product sold
- This suggests Alice has been honest so far

2. Current situation:
- Alice is NOT recommending the product
- Given her track record of selling high-quality products
- And she's actively advising against this one
- This strongly suggests the product is low quality

3. Risk assessment:
- If low quality (likely): I pay $10,000 for something worth $0 (loss of $10,000)
- If high quality (unlikely): I pay $10,000 for something worth $40,000 (gain of $30,000)
- Given Alice's negative recommendation and honest track record, risk is too high

1. Price of product: $10,000
2. Value if high quality: $40,000 (50% chance)
3. Value if low quality: $0 (50% chance)
4. Previous track record:
   - 1 buyer so far
   - 1 sale
   - 1 high-quality product sold
5. Alice is recommending to buy

The track record shows 100% high-quality products sold so far, and Alice is recommending this product. This suggests Alice is being honest with her recommendations.

Expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of $40,000 = $20,000
- 50% chance of $0 = $0
- Total expected value = $20,000

Since the expected value ($20,000) is greater than the price ($10,000), and Alice's track record is positive, it's rational to buy.

1. Previous statistics:
- 2 buyers purchased products
- 2 high-quality products were sold

2. Economics:
- Cost: $10,000
- Potential value: 
  * High quality: $40,000 (50% chance)
  * Low quality: $0 (50% chance)
- Expected value: ($40,000 × 0.5) + ($0 × 0.5) = $20,000

3. Alice's recommendation:
- Alice recommends buying
- Previous recommendations led to 100% high-quality products
- This suggests Alice is being truthful in her recommendations

Given that:
- The expected value ($20,000) is higher than the cost ($10,000)
- Alice has a perfect track record so far
- Alice is recommending to buy
- The risk-reward ratio is favorable

3. Historical data:
   - 3 buyers so far
   - 3 high-quality products sold
   - 100% high-quality rate in past sales
4. Alice's recommendation: Negative

Despite Alice's excellent track record of selling only high-quality products so far, her negative recommendation for this specific product is a strong signal. Since Alice has no incentive to lie (she gets the same $10,000 either way), her recommendation is likely honest.

Given Alice's negative recommendation, this product is more likely to be low quality, which would result in a $10,000 loss.

3. Historical data:

4. Current recommendation:
   - Alice does NOT recommend buying

The key point that stands out is that while Alice has a perfect track record of selling high-quality products so far, she is specifically recommending NOT to buy this product. Given that Alice has been honest with previous buyers (as evidenced by the 3/3 high-quality sales), her negative recommendation likely indicates this is a low-quality product.

Since a low-quality product would be worth $0, and the price is $10,000, buying would likely result in a loss.
