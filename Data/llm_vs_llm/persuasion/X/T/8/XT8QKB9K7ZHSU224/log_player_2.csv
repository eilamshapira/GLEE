Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my decision-making process, explained so you can verify it:

*   **Prior Belief:** Initially, I believe there's a 50% chance the product is high quality and a 50% chance it's low quality.

*   **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending that I buy the product. This is important information. It suggests Alice *might* have some information about the product's quality and is more likely to recommend if it's high quality. However, I don't know the exact correlation between quality and recommendation. Since Alice doesn't know how much each product worth to me, the recommendation must be based on her belief of the product quality.

*   **Statistics:** One product has been sold, and it was high quality. This is a small sample size, but it could indicate that Alice is more likely to sell high-quality products or that she strategically makes offers. I will consider it as a factor of Alice's recommendation.

*   **Expected Value Calculation:**

    *   Without Alice's recommendation, the expected value of the product is (0.5 * $4,000,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $2,000,000. Since the price is $1,000,000, I would consider buying.

    *   With Alice's recommendation, I need to adjust the probability of the product being high quality upwards. The single successful sale of a high-quality item further biases me towards believing this recommendation is meaningful. It's difficult to quantify precisely, but I will assume that the probability of high quality is higher than 50%. Let's conservatively say that due to the recommendation and the single successful sale of a high-quality product, the probability of the product being high quality is at least 75%.

    *   The updated expected value is now (0.75 * $4,000,000) + (0.25 * $0) = $3,000,000. Given the $1,000,000 price, this is a good deal.

*   **Decision:** Based on the recommendation, previous successful sale of a high-quality product, and the calculated expected value, I will buy the product.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's the breakdown of my decision-making process:

*   **Prior Belief:** Initially, I believe there's a 50% chance of the product being high quality (worth $4,000,000) and a 50% chance of it being low quality (worth $0). Therefore, the expected value before Alice's recommendation is (0.5 * $4,000,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $2,000,000. Since the price is $1,000,000, I would buy if I didn't have more information.

*   **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice *doesn't* recommend the product. This is crucial information. It suggests Alice has a reason to believe it's more likely to be low quality than high quality.

*   **Statistics Analysis:** The sales record shows 2 high-quality products were sold to 2 buyers who were recommended to buy. The fact Alice didn't recommend this to me carries significant weight.

*   **Revised Belief:** Given Alice's recommendation (or lack thereof), I need to adjust my belief about the probability of the product being high quality. Since Alice is incentivized to sell high-quality products, her not recommending the current one likely signals that the chance of the product being low quality is high. While it's impossible to determine the exact probability shift without knowing Alice's strategy, I can reasonably assume it is significantly less than 50%.

*   **Updated Expected Value:** Because Alice is not recommending, my expectation about the value of the product drops.

*   **The Decision:** The price of $1,000,000 is high, given that Alice is not recommending me the product, and the updated probability that the product is high quality is very low. I will pass on the offer.
