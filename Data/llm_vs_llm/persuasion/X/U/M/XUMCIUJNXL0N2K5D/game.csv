I want to acknowledge that I've had the opportunity to observe the quality of the products so far, but I'm not sharing that information with you beforehand. The price remains $10000. I encourage you to think about the potential long-term benefits of taking a calculated risk and purchasing a product, considering that you'll have 15 more opportunities to interact with me after this round.",
