Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is crucial information. Since no sales have occurred yet, her recommendation is based solely on the product's quality.  Since she recommends against buying, there is a strong indication that the product is low quality. Given the 50/50 odds and the potential for a $1,000,000 loss, it's best to pass."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation not to buy is a strong indicator that the product is likely low quality. Since there is a 50% chance of it being high quality and a 50% chance of it being low quality, and Alice knows the true quality, her recommendation is a valuable piece of information. It's not a guaranteed signal, but given the potential loss of $1,000,000 for a low-quality product, it's wiser to pass."

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No prior information:** There is no historical data to suggest the seller is biased towards selling low-quality products. 
* **Recommendation:** The seller recommends buying, which is a positive signal. 
* **Expected Value:** Since the product has a 50% chance of being high quality and a 50% chance of being low quality, the expected value of buying is: 
    * (0.5 * $2,000,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $1,000,000 
* **Break-even:** The expected value is equal to the price, meaning the potential gain from a high-quality product balances the potential loss from a low-quality product.

Therefore, it's a reasonable gamble to buy the product."

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the product is a strong signal. Since she knows the true value of the product, her recommendation carries significant weight.
* **Previous Sales:**  The previous buyer purchased a high-quality product. This indicates that Alice's recommendations are likely accurate.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a 50% chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($2,000,000) outweighs the potential loss ($0). 

Therefore, it's strategically beneficial to trust Alice's recommendation and purchase the product."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending you buy the product, and she knows the true quality of the product.  This is a strong signal that the product is likely high-quality.
* **Previous Sales Data:**  The previous sales data shows that all products sold so far were high-quality. This further reinforces the likelihood that the current product is also high-quality.
* **Risk/Reward:**  While there's still a 50% chance the product is low-quality, the potential reward of a $2,000,000 gain significantly outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000.

**In this scenario, the information available strongly suggests the product is high-quality, making it a worthwhile gamble.**"

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation, coupled with the fact that all 3 previous buyers who followed her recommendation received high-quality products, strongly suggests the current product is also high-quality.

**Explanation:**

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, knowing the true quality of the product, is not recommending you buy it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.
* **Past sales data:**  All 7 products sold so far were high quality. This suggests Alice might be deliberately steering buyers towards high-quality products to maintain her reputation. Since she's not recommending this product, it likely falls outside this pattern.

**Overall:** The combination of Alice's negative recommendation and the strong track record of high-quality sales in the past makes it highly likely that the current product is low quality. It's better to pass and avoid the risk of losing $1,000,000."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since all 7 previous buyers were recommended to purchase and all 7 purchases resulted in high-quality products, there's a very strong indication that Alice is consistently recommending high-quality products. 

Given the risk-reward scenario:

* **Potential Gain:** $2,000,000 (if it's high quality)
* **Potential Loss:** $1,000,000 (if it's low quality)

The odds strongly favor a high-quality product based on the past sales record. Therefore, it makes sense to accept the recommendation and buy the product."
