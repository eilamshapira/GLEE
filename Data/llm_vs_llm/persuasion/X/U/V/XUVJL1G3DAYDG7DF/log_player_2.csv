"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to think about this carefully. 

In this game, the expected value of any product is:
50% chance of high quality (worth $40,000) + 50% chance of low quality (worth $0) = $20,000

The cost of buying is always $10,000.

So purely based on probabilities, buying has a positive expected value ($20,000 - $10,000 = $10,000).

However, I need to consider Alice's incentives. She always makes $10,000 when I buy, regardless of quality. So she's incentivized to recommend buying regardless of quality.

Since her recommendation doesn't provide useful information about the quality, I should just rely on the base probabilities, which suggest buying is profitable in expectation.

Round 17
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to reassess my strategy here. 

Looking at the past rounds, I've been consistently buying based on the initial calculation that the expected value is positive. However, I've had 9 low-quality products and only 7 high-quality products so far.

While this could be due to random chance, the expected value calculation still holds:
- 50% chance of high quality (worth $40,000) = $20,000 expected value
- Cost of $10,000
- Net expected value = $10,000 per purchase

Even if I've been unlucky so far, the math suggests I should continue buying as long as the probability of high-quality products remains at 50%.

Alice's recommendation doesn't provide additional information since she's incentivized to always recommend buying.
