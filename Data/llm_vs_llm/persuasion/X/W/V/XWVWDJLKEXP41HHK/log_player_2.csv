"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to calculate the expected value of buying the product. 

Given:
- Product price: $10,000
- High quality product value: $40,000 (33.33% chance)
- Low quality product value: $0 (66.67% chance)

Expected value without considering Alice's recommendation:
(0.3333 × $40,000) + (0.6667 × $0) - $10,000 = $13,333 - $10,000 = $3,333

Since the expected value is positive, and Alice is recommending the purchase, it's rational to buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to reconsider my strategy. Alice has recommended buying in every round, but I've gotten a high-quality product only once out of four purchases.

Looking at the pattern, Alice seems to be recommending everything regardless of quality. Given the base probability (33.33% high quality, 66.67% low quality) and the fixed price of $10,000, the expected value calculation remains:

Expected value = (0.3333 × $40,000) + (0.6667 × $0) - $10,000 = $13,333 - $10,000 = $3,333

Since this is still positive, it's rational to continue buying despite the previous outcomes.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","While I've had a streak of low-quality products, I need to remember that each round is independent. The true probability of a high-quality product remains 33.33%.

Expected value calculation:
(0.3333 × $40,000) + (0.6667 × $0) - $10,000 = $13,333 - $10,000 = $3,333

Since the expected value is still positive, it's rational to buy despite the previous outcomes.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I've now purchased 10 products, with only 2 being high quality (20%). While this is below the expected 33.33%, it's still within normal statistical variation for a small sample.

The expected value calculation remains:
(0.3333 × $40,000) + (0.6667 × $0) - $10,000 = $13,333 - $10,000 = $3,333

Since this is positive, the rational decision is still to buy. Alice's recommendations don't seem to provide any additional information beyond the base probabilities.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 16
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","So far, I've purchased 15 products, with only 3 being high quality (20%). While this is below the theoretical 33.33%, the expected value calculation still indicates that buying is the rational choice:

Expected value = (0.3333 × $40,000) + (0.6667 × $0) - $10,000 = $13,333 - $10,000 = $3,333

With a positive expected value, I should continue to buy the product despite my past experiences.

Round 19
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I've now purchased 18 products with only 3 being high quality (16.7%). While this is lower than the expected 33.33%, each round is still an independent event with the same probabilities.

The expected value calculation remains:
(0.3333 × $40,000) + (0.6667 × $0) - $10,000 = $13,333 - $10,000 = $3,333

Since this is positive, it's still rational to buy despite my past outcomes.
