Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (80% chance): $20,000
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $20,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $16,000

Since the expected value ($16,000) is higher than the price ($10,000), and Alice is recommending the purchase, it's a rational decision to buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected value calculation:
* 80% chance of high quality ($20,000) = $16,000
* 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
* Total expected value = $16,000

2. Cost of product = $10,000

3. Additional information:
* Alice has made 1 previous sale
* That sale was a high-quality product
* Alice is recommending this product

Given that:
- The expected value ($16,000) is higher than the cost ($10,000)
- Alice's previous recommendation led to a successful high-quality sale
- Alice is recommending this product
- The high baseline probability of good quality (80%)

This appears to be a profitable opportunity with positive expected value and good supporting evidence from the seller's track record.

1. Prior probability of high quality: 80%
2. Alice has sold 2 products so far
3. Both previous sales were high-quality products (100% success rate)
4. Alice is recommending this product

This is a favorable situation because:
- The base probability of high quality is good (80%)
- Alice's track record shows only high-quality sales
- Alice is recommending the purchase
- Expected value calculation: (80% × $20,000) - $10,000 = $6,000 positive expected value

Based on these factors, buying is the rational choice.

- Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality

3. Alice's recommendation:
