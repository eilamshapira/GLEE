~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my reasoning:

*   **Prior Probability:** Before any information, the chance of a high-quality product is 80% and a low-quality product is 20%.

*   **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying. Since Alice knows the quality, her recommendation is significant.

*   **Sales Record:** 4 out of some unknown number of buyers purchased, and all 4 were high quality. This suggests Alice might be more likely to recommend a purchase if the item is high quality.

*   **Expected Value (without recommendation):** 0.8 * $1,200,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $960,000. This is less than the price of $1,000,000, so *without* the recommendation, I wouldn't buy.

*   **Expected Value (with recommendation):** Since Alice recommends buying, and we know that previous purchases all turned out high quality, I should trust her recommendation. The cost is $1,000,000. Given the information, it is more likely that the product is high quality and the product is worth $1,200,000 to me.

Based on all the available information, I will make the purchase.
