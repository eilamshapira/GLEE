"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the lack of previous sales records and the recommendation from Alice, I'll use the probability information.

- Probability of high quality = 33.33%
- Probability of low quality = 66.67%

Expected value calculation:
- High quality: $4,000,000 * 33.33% = $1,332,000
- Low quality: $0 * 66.67% = $0

Total expected value = $1,332,000

The expected value ($1,332,000) is higher than the price of the product ($1,000,000). Therefore, it's worth the risk to buy the product based on the expected value and the recommendation.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the given statistics, we know that Alice has recommended a product to 1 buyer before you and it was high quality. There seems to be a pattern that when Alice recommends, it might be a high-quality product. However, the sample size is quite small, with only one instance to base the decision on.

Nevertheless, given that Alice is recommending the product, combined with the strong incentive of a high payoff when the product is high quality, it would be rational to consider that Alice's recommendation might indicate a high-quality product. 

Considering the probabilities and the available information, it's reasonable to take the risk and proceed with the purchase.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the previous sales data and Alice's recommendation:

- 2 products were sold, both of which were high quality.
- Alice did not recommend purchasing the current product.

Given the product has a 33.33% chance of being high quality and Alice's recommendation is a significant factor, it appears Alice only recommended buying high-quality products to other buyers. 

Since Alice did not recommend buying, the likelihood of this product being low quality is high.

Therefore, the decision is as follows:

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the situation:

1. Alice has sold 5 products, all of which have been high-quality.
2. The probability of a product being high-quality, based solely on the base probability, is 33.33%. However, all sold products have been high-quality, which might suggest Alice's recommendation can be trusted.

Given that:
- Alice's previous 5 recommendations resulted in high-quality sales.
- A high-quality product is valued at $4,000,000, while you pay $1,000,000.
- Alice's recommendation here also suggests you should buy.

The risk of obtaining a low-quality product seems lower because there hasn't been evidence of low-quality product sales yet. Therefore, it's reasonable to follow Alice's recommendation.
