Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully.

Given information:
- Product price: $1,000,000
- High-quality probability: 50%
- High-quality product value: $3,000,000
- Low-quality product value: $0
- Alice recommends buying the product
- No sales history yet

Expected value calculation:
(50% × $3,000,000) + (50% × $0) - $1,000,000 = $1,500,000 - $1,000,000 = $500,000

Since the expected value is positive ($500,000), and I have no prior sales data to suggest Alice's recommendations aren't trustworthy, it makes sense to buy.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze whether to buy the product based on Alice's recommendation and the statistics provided.

Given information:
- The product costs $1,000,000
- High-quality product is worth $3,000,000 (profit: $2,000,000)
- Low-quality product is worth $0 (loss: $1,000,000)
- Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
- Alice has sold 1 product so far, and it was high quality
- Alice recommends that I buy the product

Alice's recommendation and her perfect track record so far (1 for 1 high-quality products) are positive signals. Since the expected value calculation ($3,000,000 × 0.5 + $0 × 0.5 - $1,000,000 = $500,000) is positive even with the base 50% probability, and we have additional positive indicators, buying seems rational.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully.

Given information:
- The product costs $1,000,000
- High-quality product value: $3,000,000
- Low-quality product value: $0
- Prior probability: 50% chance of high/low quality
- Alice does NOT recommend buying this product
- Previous record: 2 buyers purchased, 2 high-quality products sold

Alice has shown perfect accuracy so far (2/2 high quality). When she doesn't recommend a product, it strongly suggests it's low quality. If I purchase a low-quality product, I lose $1,000,000. 

Based on Alice's negative recommendation and her perfect track record of selling only high-quality products, I should not buy this product.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

- Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality
- A high-quality product is worth $3M to me, low-quality worth $0
- The fixed price is $1M
- Alice knows the quality and is giving me a recommendation to buy
- Previous track record: 2 buyers purchased, and 2 high-quality products were sold

Since Alice has a perfect record of selling only high-quality products so far, and she's recommending this product, there's a strong indication this is a high-quality product. If it is high-quality, my expected value is $3M - $1M = $2M profit.

While Alice could be strategic in her recommendations, her perfect track record suggests reliability in this case.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at the situation:

- Alice's recommendations have led to 3 buyers purchasing products
- All 3 products sold were high quality
- Alice is recommending that I buy this product
- The price is $1,000,000
- A high-quality product is worth $3,000,000 to me
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me
- Products have a 50% chance of being high or low quality

Given that Alice has a perfect track record of recommending only high-quality products, and she's recommending I buy this one, it seems likely to be high quality. If it is high quality, the expected value is $3,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $2,000,000 profit.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Looking at the information provided, I need to make a decision about buying the product for $1,000,000.

Alice has sold 4 products so far, and all 4 were high-quality products. This suggests Alice has been honest in her recommendations, as all previous buyers who followed her advice received high-quality products worth $3,000,000.

Alice is now recommending that I buy the current product. Given her perfect track record of recommending only high-quality products, and the fact that she knows the true quality of the product, it seems reasonable to trust her recommendation.

If I buy the product:
- If it's high-quality (which seems likely based on Alice's recommendation and track record), I gain $3,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $2,000,000
- If it's low-quality, I lose $1,000,000

Based on the evidence of Alice's previous recommendations and sales, I'll accept her recommendation.

- Products have a 50% chance of being high or low quality
- Alice knows each product's true value
- Alice is recommending I buy this product
- 5 previous buyers who received recommendations from Alice bought products
- All 5 of those products were high quality

This is significant evidence that Alice's recommendations are honest and reliable. The fact that all previous recommended products were high quality suggests Alice is only recommending products when they're actually valuable.

Given that Alice is recommending I buy, and her track record shows 100% accuracy in recommending high-quality products, buying would be the rational choice.

- Alice's sales record: 6 buyers bought, all 6 got high-quality products
- Alice is recommending I buy this product

This perfect track record of only selling high-quality products and Alice's recommendation suggests she's being truthful. The expected value is positive, and Alice's behavior suggests the current product is likely high quality.

Looking at the statistics:
- 8 buyers purchased products based on Alice's recommendations
- 8 high-quality products have been sold
- Alice is recommending that I buy the product

This perfect track record (100% high-quality products sold) strongly suggests that Alice is providing honest recommendations. Since Alice knows the true quality of each product and is recommending I buy, and her previous recommendations have all resulted in high-quality products, I should trust this recommendation.

The expected value calculation also supports this decision:
- If high quality (which seems likely): $3,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $2,000,000 profit
- If low quality: $0 - $1,000,000 = -$1,000,000 loss

Alice has recommended 9 previous buyers to purchase, and all of them ended up with high-quality products. Now she's recommending that I buy as well.

Given that:

- A high-quality product is worth $3,000,000 to me
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me
- Alice has a perfect record so far (9/9 high-quality products sold)
- Alice knows the true quality of the product
- Alice is now recommending that I buy

This suggests Alice is being truthful in her recommendations. If I buy and get a high-quality product, my net benefit would be $2,000,000 ($3,000,000 value minus $1,000,000 cost).

Based on this information and her perfect track record, I should accept her recommendation.

Alice's sales record shows 12 buyers have purchased products, and all 12 were high-quality products. This suggests Alice's recommendations have been accurate so far.

In this case, Alice does NOT recommend me to buy the product. Given her perfect track record of selling only high-quality products, and now she's advising against purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality.

- If low quality (likely given Alice's recommendation): 0.5 * $0 = $0
