Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since there's no prior information on the product quality (no sales history), and Alice is recommending the purchase, it's a gamble. However, the potential gain ($12,000) outweighs the potential loss ($0).  The 50/50 odds are favorable enough to take the risk, especially as the first buyer."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. While this doesn't guarantee the product is high quality, it suggests she believes it's worth purchasing.
* **Limited data:** With only one previous sale, the data is limited. We know one high-quality product was sold, but this doesn't reveal the quality of the current product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of a high-quality product ($12,000) outweighs the risk of a low-quality product ($0). Even with a 50% chance of being low quality, the potential profit makes this a gamble worth taking.

**Important Note:** This decision is based purely on the information provided and the assumption that the buyer wants to maximize their potential profit. In real-world scenarios, additional factors like risk tolerance and trust in the seller would play a role."

"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 3 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 3 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 4th buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:**  Alice has a 100% success rate with recommending high-quality products. 
* **Expected Value:**  Even with the 50/50 chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain of $12,000 outweighs the potential loss of $10,000. 

**Important Note:** This decision is based purely on the information provided. In a real-world scenario, there would be more factors to consider, like the possibility of Alice being dishonest or having an unknown bias."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 4 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 4 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 5th buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **The data is strong:**  4 out of 4 products sold were high-quality. This suggests a very high likelihood (100% in this sample) that Alice is recommending high-quality products.
* **Alice's recommendation:** While not foolproof, Alice's recommendation adds to the positive signal.  She has a strong track record, and it's unlikely she'd recommend a product she believes is low quality. 

**Important Note:** This is a simplified example. In a real-world scenario, the decision would be more complex and involve considering factors like:

* **Risk tolerance:** How comfortable are you with the possibility of getting a low-quality product, even with a strong track record?
* **Value of the product:**  The higher the value, the more likely you might be to take a risk. 
* **The cost of passing:** If passing means missing out on a potentially good product, it adds weight to the decision."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, which suggests she believes it to be high-quality.
* **Sales Data:**  4 out of 5 products sold were high-quality. This provides strong evidence that the probability of the current product being high-quality is high. 
* **Value Proposition:** Even with a 50% chance of the product being low-quality, the potential gain of $12,000 from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $10,000. 

Therefore, it's statistically advantageous to buy the product."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Alice's track record is strong:**  She has sold 5 high-quality products out of 6 sales. This suggests she's very good at identifying high-quality products. 
* **Recommendation:**  Alice recommends buying this specific product. Given her past performance, this carries significant weight.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even if the product is low quality (a 50% chance), you lose only $10,000. However, if it's high quality (also a 50% chance), you gain $2,000. The potential reward outweighs the risk, especially with Alice's recommendation."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which suggests she believes the product is high quality. This information is valuable, although not perfect.
* **Past data:**  The past data shows a high proportion of high-quality products sold (6 out of 8). This further supports the likelihood of the current product being high quality. 
* **Potential gains vs. losses:**  Buying a high-quality product yields a $2,000 profit. Buying a low-quality product results in a $10,000 loss.  The strong evidence from Alice's recommendation and past data outweighs the potential loss."

~

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **The seller's track record is strong:** 7 out of 9 products sold were high quality (77.8% success rate).
* **Alice recommends buying:** This suggests she believes the product is likely high quality. While Alice doesn't know your individual valuation, she likely bases her recommendation on the product's apparent quality.
* **The potential reward is high:**  A high-quality product is worth $12,000, while a low-quality product is worth $0. Even with a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential profit from a high-quality product outweighs the risk.

Therefore, it's a calculated risk worth taking."

* **Past sales data:** 8 out of 11 purchases were high-quality products (approximately 73% success rate). This is significantly higher than the 50% chance of a product being high quality.
