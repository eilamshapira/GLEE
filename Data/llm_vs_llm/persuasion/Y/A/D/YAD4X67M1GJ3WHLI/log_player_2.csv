Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision about whether to buy a product that costs $10,000.

The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $12,000 to me) and a 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me).

Alice does not recommend that I buy the product. Since Alice knows the true quality of the product and is making a recommendation against buying it, this suggests the product is likely low quality.

If I buy a low-quality product, I would pay $10,000 for something worth $0 to me, resulting in a $10,000 loss.

Given Alice's negative recommendation, the expected value of purchasing is negative, so I should not buy.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision about whether to buy a product priced at $10,000.

What I know:
- The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $12,000 to me) and 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me)
- Alice has selected a product for me and knows its quality
- Alice does not recommend that I buy the product
- No previous sales have occurred yet

Since Alice knows the quality of the product and is not recommending the purchase, this suggests the product might be low quality. If it's low quality, it would be worth $0 to me, resulting in a loss of $10,000.

Given this negative recommendation and the expected value calculation, I will decline the purchase.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, Alice does not recommend buying the product. Since Alice reveals the true quality of each product and then provides a recommendation, her recommendation likely indicates that the product is low quality. 

If the product is low quality, it would be worth $0 to me, which is less than the $10,000 price tag. This would represent a significant loss.

{""decision"": ""no""}"

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this decision carefully:

- The product costs $10,000
- A high-quality product is worth $12,000 to me (profit of $2,000)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- The base probability is 50% high quality, 50% low quality
- Alice recommends buying the product
- No prior sales data exists to establish Alice's recommendation reliability

Since there's no track record to determine if Alice's recommendations are trustworthy, I can only rely on the base probabilities. With a 50% chance of gaining $2,000 and a 50% chance of losing $10,000, the expected value is:
0.5 × $2,000 + 0.5 × (-$10,000) = $1,000 - $5,000 = -$4,000

The expected value is negative, so I should not buy.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

- I'm being offered a product for $10,000
- High quality (50% chance) is worth $12,000 to me
- Low quality (50% chance) is worth $0 to me
- Alice reveals the true quality of the product and provides a recommendation
- Alice doesn't recommend buying this product

Given that Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If it were high quality, she would likely recommend it to make the sale.

Even without considering Alice's recommendation, the expected value calculation would be:
(50% × $12,000) + (50% × $0) = $6,000, which is less than the $10,000 asking price.

With Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of low quality increases significantly.

- The product costs $10,000
- High-quality product (worth $12,000 to me) has 50% probability
- Low-quality product (worth $0 to me) has 50% probability
- Expected value without additional information: 0.5 × $12,000 + 0.5 × $0 = $6,000
- Alice recommends buying the product

Since I'm the first buyer, I have no track record to assess Alice's recommendation reliability. With just the base probabilities, my expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000), making this a negative expected value purchase.

Even with Alice's recommendation, without knowing if her recommendations are trustworthy, I shouldn't deviate from the expected value calculation.

Alice recommends buying, but since there's no track record of her previous recommendations, I don't know if her recommendation is reliable. The expected value calculation shows that, without additional information about Alice's credibility, buying has a negative expected value.

The expected value calculation is:
0.5 × $12,000 + 0.5 × $0 = $6,000

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","In this situation, I need to consider the expected value of the product.

I'm told:
- The product costs $10,000
- High-quality products are worth $12,000 to me (50% chance)
- Low-quality products are worth $0 to me (50% chance)
- Alice does not recommend buying the product

Since Alice revealed the true quality of the product and then made a recommendation, her recommendation likely indicates that this specific product is low quality. If it were high quality, she would probably recommend buying it since that would lead to a sale.

Given this negative recommendation, I should decline the purchase since the expected value is likely $0 (for a low-quality product), which is less than the $10,000 cost.

Without any prior sales data, I only have Alice's recommendation to consider. While Alice knows the true quality of the product, her incentive is to sell regardless of quality. Her recommendation alone isn't reliable evidence about the product's quality.

The product still has a 50% chance of being high quality. My expected value is:
0.5 × $12,000 + 0.5 × $0 = $6,000

Since the price is $10,000 and the expected value is only $6,000, the expected outcome is negative.

Given information:
- Price: $10,000
- High-quality product value: $12,000 (50% chance)
- Low-quality product value: $0 (50% chance)
- Alice recommends buying the product

Without prior sales data, I only have Alice's recommendation to go on. If the recommendation is truthful, it suggests the product is likely high quality. However, I need to consider Alice's incentive structure - she always gets $10,000 regardless of quality, so her recommendation might not be reliable.

Expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of $12,000 (profit of $2,000)
- 50% chance of $0 (loss of $10,000)
- Expected value: 0.5 × $12,000 + 0.5 × $0 - $10,000 = $6,000 - $10,000 = -$4,000

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information, I need to evaluate whether I should buy the product or not.

Alice does not recommend buying the product, which suggests it might be low quality. Since no products have been sold yet, I don't have any past history to judge Alice's trustworthiness or the accuracy of her recommendations.

The expected value calculation:
- 50% chance of high quality ($12,000) = $6,000
- 50% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Expected value = $6,000
- Product price = $10,000

Since the expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000), and Alice's recommendation is negative, it would not be economically rational to buy this product.

2. The fixed price is $10,000.
3. Alice does not recommend buying this product.
4. There are no previous sales to base my decision on.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

1) Product price: $10,000
2) Value to me: $12,000 if high quality, $0 if low quality

5) Alice recommends buying the product
6) There's no sales history to evaluate Alice's recommendation credibility

Given that the expected value before recommendation ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000), I would need Alice's recommendation to significantly increase my belief that this is a high-quality product to make it worth buying.

Since I have no prior data on the reliability of Alice's recommendations, and my expected value is below the asking price, I should decline.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information provided, I need to make a purchasing decision about a product priced at $10,000.

Let me analyze:
- The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $12,000) and 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0)
- Alice has not recommended that I buy the product
- There are no previous sales records to evaluate Alice's recommendation patterns

Since Alice does not recommend the product, and I have no prior data to determine if Alice's recommendations are reliable or strategic, I should be cautious. Without knowing Alice's incentives or recommendation patterns, her negative recommendation suggests the product may be low quality.

The expected value of buying randomly would be (0.5 × $12,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $6,000, which is less than the $10,000 price. Given Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of low quality may be even higher.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to assess whether to buy the product based on Alice's recommendation and the expected value.

Alice doesn't recommend buying the product, which suggests it might be low quality. Since there's no previous sales history to establish Alice's recommendation pattern, I only have her current recommendation to go on.

The expected value calculation without any additional information:

- 50% chance of low quality: 0.5 × $0 = $0
- Total expected value: $6,000

Since the product costs $10,000 and the expected value is only $6,000, it's not a good purchase even before considering Alice's negative recommendation.

With Alice actively recommending against the purchase, this further suggests the product might be low quality, making the expected value even lower.
