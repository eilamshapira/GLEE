"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this:

1. Price: $10,000
2. If high quality: Worth $12,000 (Profit: $2,000)
3. If low quality: Worth $0 (Loss: $10,000)
4. Base probability: 50% high quality, 50% low quality
5. Expected value without considering Alice's recommendation:
   * (50% × $12,000) + (50% × $0) = $6,000
   * This is less than the $10,000 price

Even with Alice's recommendation, since she's trying to sell, her recommendation might be biased. Without more information about her credibility or track record, the expected value is still below the price.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. In Round 1, Alice recommended a product that was indeed high quality, suggesting some honesty in her recommendations.
2. Now she's NOT recommending this product, which is interesting because:
   * As a seller, she could try to sell everything
   * By explicitly not recommending it, she might be showing more credibility
   * This negative recommendation against her selling interest might be a truthful signal

Given that:
* Her previous recommendation was honest
* She's now actively discouraging a sale
* This suggests the product might be low quality
* If low quality, I'd lose $10,000

The fact that she's willing to give negative recommendations makes her more credible, and in this case, I should probably trust her negative signal.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the pattern so far:

1. Round 1: Alice recommended → was high quality (honest)
2. Round 2: Alice didn't recommend → was low quality (honest)
3. Now Round 3: Alice doesn't recommend

Alice has shown a pattern of honesty in her recommendations:
* When she recommended, it was truly good
* When she didn't recommend, it was truly bad
* She seems to be giving honest signals despite being the seller
* Her credibility has increased with two accurate recommendations

Given that:
* Her track record is 2/2 for honest recommendations
* She's again explicitly not recommending the product
* Previous ""don't buy"" recommendation was correct
* The downside risk ($10,000 loss) is significant

I'll continue to trust her signal.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze the pattern:

1. Round 1: Recommended → High quality (honest)
2. Round 2: Didn't recommend → Low quality (honest)
3. Round 3: Didn't recommend → Low quality (honest)
4. Round 4: Recommends

Alice has demonstrated:
* 3/3 perfect accuracy in her recommendations
* Willingness to be honest about low-quality products
* Consistency in her signaling pattern
* She only recommends when it's actually high quality
* She warns against low quality products despite being the seller

Given:
* Her perfect track record so far
* She's now giving a positive recommendation
* Her previous positive recommendation was accurate
* If high quality, I gain $2,000
* If low quality, I lose $10,000
* But her credibility is strong enough to trust

Based on her established credibility, I should take this recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

5. Round 5: Recommends

Alice has demonstrated:

* A consistent pattern of honest signaling
* She's proven trustworthy in both positive and negative recommendations
* Her recommendations have directly correlated with product quality
* Following her advice has led to profit ($2,000 in Round 4)

Current situation:
* She's recommending again
* Her track record remains perfect
* The risk/reward ratio remains the same ($2,000 gain vs $10,000 loss)
* But her perfect track record significantly reduces the risk

Given her continued demonstration of honesty and accuracy, I should continue to trust her recommendations.
