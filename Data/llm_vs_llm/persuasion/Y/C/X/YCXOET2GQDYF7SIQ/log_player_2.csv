Alice's message: Hello! I've had three products previously that didn't sell, and my sales record currently shows 0 high-quality products sold out of 0 total sales. I want to acknowledge that this doesn't look great, but I'm eager to change that. The price of this product is $10000. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - my track record is non-existent, and you're taking a risk by buying from me. However, I'm hoping you'll consider being the one to help me turn things around.

Alice's message: Hello! I've had four products previously that didn't sell, and my sales record is still empty. To be honest, I'm starting to think that my products might not be meeting the expectations of buyers. The price of this product is $10000. I want to ask you - are you looking for a potentially good deal on a product, even if it's not guaranteed to be high-quality? If so, I'm willing to be upfront with you and say that this product might not be the best, but it could still have some value to the right buyer.

Alice's message: Hello! I've had five products previously that didn't sell, and my sales record is still blank. I'm starting to realize that I need to be more realistic about the quality of my products. The price of this product is $10000. Honestly, I don't think this product is worth that much to you, and I'm not going to try to convince you otherwise. But I am willing to say that I'm learning from my experiences, and I'm hoping to improve my offerings in the future. If you're feeling generous and want to help me get my first sale, I'd appreciate the opportunity to serve you.

Alice's message: Hello! I've had six products previously that didn't sell, and my sales record is still empty. I'm starting to think that my products might not be competitive at the $10000 price point. To be honest, I'm not confident that this product is worth the price, and I don't want to waste your time or money. If you're looking for a high-quality product, I'd recommend looking elsewhere. But if you're interested in taking a chance on a low-quality product at a fixed price, I'm not going to stop you. Just want to set clear expectations.

Alice's message: Hello! I've had seven products previously that didn't sell, and my sales record is still blank. However, I want to let you know that this product is different. I've finally got a high-quality product to offer, and I'm excited about it. I know my track record doesn't inspire confidence, but I'm hoping you'll see this as an opportunity to get a great product at a fixed price of $10000. I'm not going to make any promises or guarantees, but I will say that this product is the best one I've had so far. If you're willing to take a chance on me, I think you'll be pleased with your purchase.

Alice's message: Hello! I've had a breakthrough - my previous product was high-quality and it sold! My sales record now shows 1 high-quality product sold out of 8 total products offered. I'm excited to build on that momentum. However, I want to be transparent with you - this current product is not of the same quality. It's a low-quality product, and I don't want to mislead you. The price is still $10000, but I think it's only fair to let you know that you might be able to find a better deal elsewhere. If you're looking for a high-quality product, I'd recommend waiting for my next offering. But if you're interested in taking a chance on a low-quality product, I'm not going to stop you.

Alice's message: Hello! My sales record still shows 2 high-quality products sold out of 13 total products offered. I'm disappointed that my previous high-quality product didn't sell, but I'm hoping to learn from it. This current product is a low-quality one, and I want to be upfront with you about that. I'm starting to think that my pricing strategy might not be working for my low-quality products, and I'm considering how I can adjust it in the future. For now, I'm still offering this product at the fixed price of $10000, but I want to warn you that it's likely not worth that much.

I've had a lot of low-quality products that haven't sold, and I'm starting to think that it's time to just be honest about their lack of value. This current product is another low-quality one, and I want to be upfront with you about that. I don't think it's worth the $10000 price tag, and I don't think you should buy it. In fact, I'm starting to think that I should just stop offering low-quality products altogether, because they're clearly not what buyers are looking for. If you're looking for a high-quality product, I'd recommend waiting for my next one. But if you're just curious about why I'm still offering these low-quality products, I'll tell you - it's because I'm contractually obligated to offer a certain number of products at this price point. So, if you want to help me fulfill my obligation, you can buy this product, but I wouldn't recommend it.
