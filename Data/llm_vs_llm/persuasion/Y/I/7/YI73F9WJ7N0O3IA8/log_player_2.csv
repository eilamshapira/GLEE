Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my decision process:

*   **Prior Belief:** Initially, I believe there's an 80% chance of a high-quality product (worth $1,250,000) and a 20% chance of a low-quality product (worth $0).

*   **Seller's Recommendation:** Alice recommends that I buy the product. This is a crucial piece of information. Alice *could* be recommending all products, regardless of quality, just to make a sale. However, the sales statistics provide some insight.

*   **Sales Statistics:** 4 out of 4 products sold have been high quality. This suggests Alice might have some ability to distinguish between high and low-quality items, or she could be extremely lucky. The fact that all sales so far are high-quality makes it more likely the recommendation is meaningful.

*   **Expected Value Calculation:**

    *   Without recommendation: (0.8 \* $1,250,000) + (0.2 \* $0) = $1,000,000. This is exactly the price, so without the recommendation, I'd be indifferent.

    *   With Recommendation: Given the prior sales record, I will assume that the recommendation means there is a higher probability of the product being high quality than 80%. Since the recommendations are based on the product quality, it is very unlikely that Alice recommends the product randomly. I will assume the probability to be 100% for now. (1.0 * $1,250,000) + (0 * $0) = $1,250,000.

*   **Decision:** Since the recommendation is likely to increase the chance of the product being high quality. The expected value is higher than the price so it is worth buying.

~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my reasoning:

*   **Base Probability:** The inherent probability of the product being high quality is 80%. This translates to an expected value of 0.8 * $1,250,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $1,000,000. This is exactly the price Alice is asking, so without any further information, I would be indifferent.

*   **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is *not* recommending the purchase. This is critical information. If Alice was always recommending high-quality products, her negative recommendation is a very strong signal that this is likely a low-quality product.

*   **Inference about Alice's Strategy:** If Alice *knew* the quality and always recommended high quality, then her ""no"" recommendation would almost guarantee a low-quality product. In that case, I would reject the purchase. However, since the problem states ""Alice does not know how much each product worth to you,"" I assume that her strategy is not always to recommend high-quality products. If her strategy is somehow random, then her recommendation does not provide extra information.

*   **Sales Statistics:** Nine products have been sold, all of which were high quality. This statistic doesn't change my decision because Alice's recommendation is a stronger signal.

Given that Alice is not recommending, and assuming Alice's recommendation is correlated with the product's quality, I will reject the purchase.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my decision-making process:

*   **Prior Belief:** Before any information, there's an 80% chance of a high-quality product and a 20% chance of low quality.

*   **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice *doesn't* recommend buying. This is crucial. It suggests the product is more likely to be low quality than the initial 20%.

*   **Sales History:** 9 high-quality products sold out of an unknown number of offers. This information is somewhat helpful. Because Alice only offers a product to each buyer once, we can assume that there were 9 buyers who were recommended to buy the product, and they did.

*   **Bayesian Reasoning:** Let's use Bayes' Theorem qualitatively. We want to know P(High Quality | No Recommendation). Bayes' Theorem tells us this is proportional to P(No Recommendation | High Quality) * P(High Quality). The fact that Alice *didn't* recommend it is evidence *against* it being high quality. It's reasonable to assume Alice has some signal, however noisy, about the quality. The question is, how much does Alice's lack of recommendation downgrade the probability.

Since Alice does not recommend the product, it is likely a low-quality product. If I buy it, I will be losing $1,000,000 if the product's quality is low.

Given all the information, the lack of recommendation significantly lowers my expectation of the product being high quality.
