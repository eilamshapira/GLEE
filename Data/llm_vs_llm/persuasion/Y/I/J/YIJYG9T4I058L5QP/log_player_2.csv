"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this rationally:

1. Prior probabilities:
- 80% chance of high quality (worth $40,000)
- 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)
- Cost is $10,000

2. Alice does NOT recommend buying:
- This is likely a negative signal about the product quality
- Given that Alice is trying to sell, a negative recommendation suggests she might be honest
- This increases the probability that this is indeed a low-quality product

3. Decision:
- Given Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of low quality is likely higher than the base 20%
- The risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality product is significant
- Better to wait for a product with a positive recommendation

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Good decision on the previous round! Alice's recommendation proved truthful.

Let's analyze again:

1. Base probabilities remain the same:
- 80% high quality ($40,000)
- 20% low quality ($0)
- Cost: $10,000

2. New information:
- Alice has proven honest in Round 1
- She again does NOT recommend buying
- This strengthens our trust in her recommendations
- When she says ""don't buy,"" it's likely a low-quality product

3. Decision:
- Given Alice's proven truthfulness and negative recommendation
- The probability of this being a low-quality product is likely very high
- Buying would be risky and likely result in a $10,000 loss

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Once again, let's analyze:

1. Historical data:
- Round 1: Alice said don't buy → was low quality
- Round 2: Alice said don't buy → was low quality
- Alice has been truthful both times

2. Base probabilities haven't changed:
- 80% high quality ($40,000)
- 20% low quality ($0)
- Cost: $10,000

3. Current situation:
- Alice is again recommending NOT to buy
- She has established a pattern of honest recommendations
- Her negative recommendations have perfectly predicted low-quality products

4. Decision:
- Alice's track record suggests she's being honest about product quality
- When she says don't buy, it's likely low quality
- No reason to deviate from our successful strategy

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

- Alice has demonstrated 100% accuracy in her recommendations
- She appears to be completely honest about low-quality products

2. Standard probabilities remain:
- 80% high quality ($40,000)
- 20% low quality ($0)
- Cost: $10,000

3. Current situation:
- Alice again recommends NOT buying
- Given her perfect track record, this is a very strong signal
- It's highly likely this is another low-quality product

4. Decision:
- There's no reason to deviate from our successful strategy
- Alice's recommendations have been perfectly reliable
- Buying would likely result in a $10,000 loss
