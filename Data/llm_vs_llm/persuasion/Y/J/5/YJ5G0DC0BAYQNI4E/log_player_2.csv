"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to decide whether to buy the product. Let me analyze:

The product costs $1,000,000.
- If high quality (80% chance), it's worth $3,000,000 to me (profit of $2,000,000)
- If low quality (20% chance), it's worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000)

Expected value = 0.8 × $2,000,000 - 0.2 × $1,000,000 = $1,600,000 - $200,000 = $1,400,000

Since the expected value is positive, it's rational to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to decide whether to buy the product again. Let me analyze:

The product costs $1,000,000.

- If low quality (20% chance), it's worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000)

Expected value = 0.8 × $2,000,000 - 0.2 × $1,000,000 = $1,600,000 - $200,000 = $1,400,000

Since the expected value is positive, it's rational to buy the product.
