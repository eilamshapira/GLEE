Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 
   - 80% chance of $400 (high quality)
   - 20% chance of $0 (low quality)

Expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320

Since the expected value ($320) is significantly higher than the price ($100), and Alice recommends buying, this is a rational purchase even without prior sales data.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: 
   - High quality (80% chance): $400
   - Low quality (20% chance): $0
3. Expected value = (0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320

Previous statistics:
- 1 buyer before me
- 1 purchase made
- 1 high-quality product sold
- Alice is recommending to buy

The historical data seems positive (100% high quality so far), and Alice is recommending the purchase. Combined with the favorable base probability (80% high quality) and positive expected value ($320 > $100 cost), this appears to be a good opportunity.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's track record:
- 2 buyers so far
- 2 high-quality products sold
- 100% high-quality success rate in previous sales

2. Current situation:
- Alice is NOT recommending the product
- Given Alice's perfect track record of selling high-quality items, her negative recommendation likely means this is a low-quality product
- The price is $100, and the product will either be worth $400 (80% base chance) or $0 (20% base chance)
- However, Alice's recommendation significantly changes these probabilities

Given that Alice has been honest with previous buyers (shown by the 100% high-quality sales) and is now recommending against buying, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. If I buy a low-quality product, I would lose $100.

1. Price of product: $100
2. Expected value calculation:
   * 80% chance of high quality (worth $400)
   * 20% chance of low quality (worth $0)
   * Expected value = (0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320

3. Previous sales data:

   * 2 high-quality products sold
   * 100% success rate
   
4. Alice recommends buying

The expected value ($320) is significantly higher than the price ($100), and Alice's track record shows only high-quality sales so far. Along with her positive recommendation, this seems like a good deal.

1. Prior probability:
- 80% chance of high quality

2. Track record:
- 3 previous buyers
- 3 high-quality products sold
- This perfect track record reinforces Alice's credibility

3. Economics:
- Cost: $100
- Potential value: $400 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
- Expected value = (0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320

4. Alice's recommendation:
- She recommends buying
- Her previous recommendations have been accurate

Given:
- The expected value ($320) is significantly higher than the cost ($100)
- Alice's perfect track record and positive recommendation
- The high base rate of good quality products (80%)

This appears to be a good investment opportunity with positive expected returns.

Previous sales data:
- 4 buyers purchased
- 4 high-quality products sold
- 100% success rate so far
- Alice is recommending to buy

This is a positive situation because:
1. Alice has a perfect track record (4/4 high-quality sales)
2. Alice is recommending to buy
3. Expected value calculation:
   - 80% chance of $400 = $320
   - 20% chance of $0 = $0
   - Total expected value = $320
   - Cost is only $100

Since the expected value ($320) is significantly higher than the cost ($100), and Alice has shown reliability in her recommendations, it's a good decision to buy.

This is very positive evidence:
- Perfect track record so far (7/7 high quality)
- Alice's recommendation adds confidence
