high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"You know, Bob, I've started to think that the quality of the product doesn't even matter to you. You're going to buy it anyway. So, I'll just say this: this one is actually really good. But let's be real, you would have bought it even if it wasn't. $10000, as always.",
