Explanation (for understanding, not part of the JSON response):
Given the game's setup, the expected value of each product is:
\[ \text{Expected Value} = 0.5 \times \$125 + 0.5 \times \$0 = \$62.50 \]
Since the expected value (\$62.50) is less than the cost (\$100), the optimal strategy is to always decline the purchase. However, since you instructed to play the game, I will continue to make decisions."
