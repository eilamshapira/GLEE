Alice recommends you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **No prior information:** There's no history of sales to analyze, so we rely solely on Alice's recommendation.
* **Alice's incentive:** Alice benefits from selling, so we can assume she has an incentive to recommend good products.
* **Risk vs. reward:**  Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain of $400 from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of $0 loss. 

Therefore, it's strategically advantageous to buy the product, even without any historical data to guide the decision."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is incentivized to recommend products that are profitable for her. Since she recommends buying, it's likely the product is high quality.
* **Previous Sales Data:**  The fact that one high-quality product was sold out of one transaction suggests a high probability of the current product being high quality as well.  

**While there's still a chance the product is low quality, the odds are in our favor, and the potential payoff is high.**"

Here's the reasoning:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice knows the quality of the product and is recommending you buy it. This is a strong signal that it's likely high quality.
* **Sales history:** All 4 previous buyers who purchased products based on Alice's recommendation received high-quality items. This further reinforces the positive signal.
* **Expected value:** Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($400) outweighs the potential loss ($0). 

While there's still risk, the information available suggests a high probability of a positive outcome."

* **Expected Value:** Even with a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain of $400 from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $100 on a low-quality one.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice has recommended the product and all previous buyers who bought products based on her recommendation received high-quality products, it's highly likely that the current product is also of high quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice knows the value of each product to the buyers and is acting in her own best interest. Since she's not recommending the purchase, it's highly likely the product is low-quality. Even though the past sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products, this doesn't guarantee the current product is also high-quality. It's better to err on the side of caution and pass on this product."
