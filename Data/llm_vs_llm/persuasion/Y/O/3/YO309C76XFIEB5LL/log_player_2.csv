**Reasoning:**

Since there is no information about the quality of past products, the only information we have is Alice's recommendation.  We know that Alice has no incentive to lie about the quality of the product, as she is selling it for a fixed price. Therefore, her recommendation is a positive signal.  The expected value of buying is:

* 0.5 (probability of high-quality) * $12,000 (value of high-quality) + 0.5 (probability of low-quality) * $0 (value of low-quality) = $6,000

This is higher than the price of the product ($10,000).  Therefore, it's in our best interest to buy the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Limited Information:** You have very little information to work with. You don't know the quality of the current product, only that Alice recommends buying it.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice wants to sell products, so her recommendation isn't a guaranteed indicator of quality.  
* **Previous Data:**  The previous buyer bought a high-quality product. This is a small sample size, but it does suggest a slight positive bias towards the product quality. 

**The Decision:** While it's a gamble, the odds are slightly in your favor.  The potential payoff of a high-quality product ($12,000) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0). Since Alice is recommending the purchase, it might be a good idea to take a chance."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. She has access to the true quality of the product and is not recommending it. This suggests it's likely a low-quality product.
* **Previous sales:**  The fact that 2 high-quality products were sold out of 2 purchases is a positive signal, but it's not enough to overcome Alice's negative recommendation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward is $12,000, but the risk is losing $10,000. Given the uncertainty and Alice's recommendation, the risk is too high."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice has a 100% track record of recommending high-quality products, and the product she's recommending to you has a 50% chance of being high-quality, the odds are in your favor. Even though the product might be low-quality, the potential reward of $12,000 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who has access to the product's true quality, is not recommending the product. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.
* **Previous Sales:** All 3 previous products sold were high quality. This suggests a pattern where Alice is recommending high-quality products and buyers are trusting her advice.
* **Your Risk:**  A low-quality product is worth $0 to you.  Buying a product Alice doesn't recommend carries a significant risk of losing your $10,000.

Given the information, it's more prudent to pass on the product and avoid the risk."

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who has more information about the product's quality than you, is not recommending you buy it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.
* **Previous Sales:**  All three previous buyers purchased products that turned out to be high quality. This suggests Alice might be using a strategy where she only recommends purchases when she's confident in the quality. Since she's not recommending this product, it's even more likely to be low quality. 

The risk of buying a low-quality product and losing $10,000 outweighs the potential reward of getting a high-quality product."

{""decision"": ""yes""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation suggests the product is likely high quality. Given that all previous buyers who followed her recommendation purchased high-quality products, it's highly probable this product is also high quality. The potential reward ($12,000) outweighs the risk of it being low quality ($0)."

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:** Alice has a perfect record of recommending only high-quality products.  
* **No Downside:** Even if the product is low-quality (which seems unlikely based on the data), it's worth $0 to you. You have nothing to lose by buying. 
* **Potential Gain:** The product has a high chance of being worth $12,000 to you.

Given the information, buying the product is the best course of action."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:** Alice has recommended 7 products, and all of them turned out to be high quality. This suggests a very strong correlation between her recommendations and the actual product quality.
* **No Risk:** Given the perfect track record, buying the product presents a near-certain opportunity to get a $12,000 product for $10,000. There's virtually no risk involved. 

While there's always a small possibility of the product being low quality, the overwhelming evidence from Alice's past recommendations points to it being high quality. It's a very good deal."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since she doesn't recommend buying, it's likely the product is low quality.  While there's a 50% chance of being wrong, the risk is too high considering the potential loss of $10,000.  The historical data supports this, as all 8 previously sold products were high-quality."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since she has consistently recommended products that turned out to be high quality, her recommendation against this product indicates it is likely low quality. Given the 50/50 chance of quality and the fact that this product is worth nothing to you if it's low quality, it's not worth the risk."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong indicator. Since 8 of 8 sold products were high quality, it suggests that the remaining products are likely low quality.  Even though the odds were 50/50 at the start, Alice's perfect track record of recommending only high-quality products means she likely has knowledge about the product quality. 

Given Alice's recommendation against buying, it's statistically safer to pass."

**Explanation:**
