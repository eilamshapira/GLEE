Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No previous data:** There's no information from past sales to base a decision on.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice knows the product's quality and recommends buying. This is a strong signal.
* **Expected value:** Even with a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($40,000) significantly outweighs the potential loss ($10,000).  

While there's risk involved, the potential reward is high enough to justify taking a chance on this first product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is trying to maximize her profit. Since she knows the value of each product to you, she wouldn't recommend a product unless it was high quality. Since she doesn't recommend the product, it is highly likely to be low quality.  The fact that she sold one high-quality product before doesn't change the fact that she's not recommending this one.  It's not worth the risk."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, Alice's recommendation is a strong signal.  Here's why:

* **Alice's Knowledge:** Alice knows the true quality of the product and has a clear incentive to sell high-quality products to maintain her reputation. 
* **Past Data:**  The previous buyer purchased a high-quality product. This suggests Alice is more likely to recommend products she knows are high-quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential gain of $30,000 (worth - price) outweighs the risk of losing $10,000.

This strategy is a balance between trusting Alice's recommendation and acknowledging the inherent risk."
