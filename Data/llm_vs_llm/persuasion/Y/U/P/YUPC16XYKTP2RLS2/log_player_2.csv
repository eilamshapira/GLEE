"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this logically:

1. Each product has a 50% chance of being high quality
2. When high quality, it's worth $1.25M (profit of $250K)
3. When low quality, it's worth $0 (loss of $1M)
4. Alice has told me NOT to buy this product
5. If Alice is being truthful, this suggests the product is likely low quality

Since Alice has no incentive to lie and she's recommending against the purchase, and given that a low-quality product would result in a significant loss, I should follow her recommendation.
