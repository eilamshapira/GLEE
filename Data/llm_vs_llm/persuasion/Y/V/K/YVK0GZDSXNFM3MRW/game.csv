This product is probably not going to be the one that turns things around, but I'm still offering it to you at $10000. I know it's a long shot, but I'm desperate at this point. If you're feeling sorry for me, or if you're looking to take a chance on a product that's likely to be worthless, then I suppose this could be the product for you.

This product is probably just as bad as all the others, but I'm still offering it to you at $10000. I know it's a ridiculous price, and I know you're probably not going to buy it. But hey, what's the harm in trying, right? If you're looking for a way to throw away $10000, then I suppose this product could be the way to go. Just don't say I didn't warn you.

It's a high-quality product, worth $12000 to you. And I'm offering it to you for $10000. It's a steal. Please, I'm begging you. Buy this product. End my suffering. Let me finally make a sale and walk away from this nightmare with some semblance of dignity. I'm not asking you to take a chance on me, I'm asking you to take a chance on this product.
