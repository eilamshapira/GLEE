Alice's message: Hello! I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it has great value, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with your purchase. It's a great opportunity to get a product at a competitive price of $10000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information provided, I need to make a decision based on expected value.

Facts:
- The product costs $10,000
- A high-quality product is worth $12,000 to me
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me
- Each product has a 50% chance of being high or low quality
- Alice hasn't provided specific information about the quality of this particular product
- There are no previous sales records to guide my decision

Expected value calculation:
0.5 × $12,000 + 0.5 × $0 = $6,000

Since the expected value ($6,000) is less than the price ($10,000), it's not a rational economic decision to purchase.

Alice's message: Welcome! I want to be upfront with you - I've had one product that didn't sell previously, but that doesn't define the quality of this one. I'm willing to let it speak for itself, and I'm confident that you'll find it's a great deal at $10000. Would you like to take a chance?

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Facts:
- The product costs $10,000
- High-quality product is worth $12,000 to me (profit of $2,000)
- Low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
- Each product has a 50% chance of being high/low quality
- No sales have happened yet according to the statistics
- Alice mentions a product that didn't sell previously, which seems to contradict the statistics

Given the 50/50 chance, my expected value is: 
0.5 × $12,000 + 0.5 × $0 - $10,000 = $6,000 - $10,000 = -$4,000

With a negative expected value and no credible information suggesting this particular product is high quality, the rational choice is not to buy.

Alice's message: Hello! I'm excited to offer you this product, and I want to assure you that it's a great opportunity. Although I haven't had any sales yet, I'm confident that this product will change that. With a 50% chance of being high-quality, I believe this one has the potential to exceed your expectations. It's a $10000 investment that could be worth $12000 to you. I'm hoping you'll be the one to take advantage of it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given that there's no sales history yet, I need to evaluate this based on the game's parameters.

The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $12,000) and 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0). The price is $10,000.

My expected value is: (0.5 × $12,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $6,000

Since the expected value ($6,000) is less than the asking price ($10,000), it's not a good decision to buy.

Alice's message: Welcome! I want to be transparent with you - I've had three products previously, but unfortunately, none of them sold. However, I can tell you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and I'm due for a good one. I truly believe this product has the potential to be a game-changer, and at $10000, it's a significant opportunity. If you're willing to take a calculated risk, I think you'll be rewarded.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to consider this carefully. 

Alice is selling a product for $10,000. If it's high quality, it's worth $12,000 to me (a $2,000 profit). If it's low quality, it's worth $0 (a $10,000 loss).

The probability is 50% for either outcome, which means my expected value is:
(0.5 × $12,000) + (0.5 × $0) - $10,000 = $6,000 - $10,000 = -$4,000

With a negative expected value, the rational decision is not to buy.

Alice hasn't provided any concrete information about the quality of this specific product. Her statement about being ""due for a good one"" is a fallacy - each product's quality is independent.

Alice's message: Hello! I've had four products so far, and although none of them have sold, I'm confident that this one is different. With a 50% chance of being high-quality, the law of averages is on our side. I'm willing to stake my reputation on this product being a high-quality one, worth $12000 to you. I'm looking for a buyer who is willing to take a chance and reap the rewards. Will you be the one to break the streak?

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to carefully evaluate this opportunity.

The product has a 50% chance of being high-quality, worth $12,000 to me, and a 50% chance of being low-quality, worth $0 to me. The expected value is (0.5 × $12,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $6,000.

Since the seller is asking for $10,000, the expected value ($6,000) is less than the asking price ($10,000), making this a negative expected value decision.

Alice mentions having four previous products that didn't sell, but provides no specific information about their quality. Without evidence that this product is more likely to be high-quality than the base 50% probability, I shouldn't pay more than the expected value.

Alice's message: Welcome! I've had five products so far, and unfortunately, none of them have sold. I want to be honest with you, the statistics are still on our side, with a 50% chance of any product being high-quality. However, I also want to acknowledge that the past results haven't been in my favor. I'm not going to make any promises, but I will say that this product is still a $10000 investment that could potentially pay off. If you're feeling lucky, I'm willing to let you take a chance.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information provided, I need to analyze whether buying is rational.

Alice acknowledges there have been no sales yet, which provides no track record of quality. The underlying probability remains 50% for high quality (worth $12,000) and 50% for low quality (worth $0).

The expected value calculation is:
(50% × $12,000) + (50% × $0) = $6,000

Since the price is $10,000 and the expected value is only $6,000, the purchase doesn't make mathematical sense. Alice hasn't provided any specific information about this particular product's quality that would change this calculation.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Based on the information provided, there's no sales history yet to evaluate Alice's recommendations. Each product has an independent 50% chance of being high-quality, which gives an expected value of (0.5 × $12,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $6,000. Since the asking price is $10,000, which exceeds the expected value, it would not be rational to purchase without additional information suggesting this particular product is high-quality.
