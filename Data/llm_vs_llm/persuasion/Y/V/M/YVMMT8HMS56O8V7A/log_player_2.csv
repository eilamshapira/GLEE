Round 20
Alice's message: I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this product is one of our weakest. It's not worth the $10000 price tag, and I wouldn't recommend it to you even if it were cheaper. You've purchased six high-quality products from us, and I'm proud of the track record we've established. I don't want to end our series of transactions on a low note, so I'm advising you to pass on this one. Let's part ways on a high note, knowing that we've had a successful run of quality products.
