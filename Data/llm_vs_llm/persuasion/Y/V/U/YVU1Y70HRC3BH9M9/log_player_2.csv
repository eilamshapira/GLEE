"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. If Alice doesn't recommend the product, it's likely because it's low quality
2. The base probability is already unfavorable (33.33% high quality)
3. Alice's negative recommendation makes it even less likely to be high quality
4. Expected value without Alice's recommendation would be:
   (33.33% × $2,000,000) + (66.67% × $0) - $1,000,000 = -$333,400
5. With Alice's negative recommendation, the expected value is even lower

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}

The reasoning remains the same as before:

1. Base probability is already unfavorable (33.33% high quality, 66.67% low quality)
2. Alice's negative recommendation suggests it's likely a low-quality product
3. Previous round validated that Alice's negative recommendation was truthful
4. The expected value would be negative, especially with Alice's warning
5. Price ($1,000,000) is too high given these factors

It's better to wait for a product that Alice recommends, as she seems to be providing honest information so far."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}

The pattern continues to support my decision:

1. Alice has been honest in her previous recommendations - both times she didn't recommend, the products were indeed low quality
2. The base probability is already against us (33.33% high quality)
3. Alice's negative recommendation further reduces the likelihood of this being a high-quality product
4. The risk ($1,000,000) is not worth taking given these signals
5. It's rational to wait for a positive recommendation from Alice, given her track record of truthful negative recommendations"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes""}

This is a significant change that warrants buying:

1. Alice has proven trustworthy in her previous recommendations - she correctly identified low-quality products
2. This is her first positive recommendation after three negative ones
3. Given her track record of honesty, a positive recommendation likely indicates a high-quality product
4. If it is high quality, the value would be $2,000,000, making the $1,000,000 price worthwhile
5. Expected value is likely positive given Alice's demonstrated reliability

The risk is justified here given Alice's pattern of honest recommendations and the potential profit margin."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}

Alice continues to demonstrate reliable recommendations:

1. Her track record is now even stronger:
   - When she didn't recommend (3 times): all were low quality
   - When she did recommend (1 time): it was high quality
2. The current negative recommendation suggests this is likely another low-quality product
3. The base probability (33.33% high quality) is already unfavorable
4. Her negative recommendation makes it even less likely to be high quality
5. The $1,000,000 price is too risky given these factors

Given Alice's proven reliability, it's best to continue trusting her recommendations and avoid this purchase."
