Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33%): $40,000
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (33.33% × $40,000) + (66.67% × $0) = $13,332

4. Additional information:
   - No sales history to reference
   - Alice does NOT recommend buying
   - Alice knows the true value

Since Alice knows the true value and is not recommending the purchase, it's likely a low-quality product. Given this negative recommendation and the fact that low-quality products are worth $0, it would be risky to purchase.

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   * High quality (33.33% chance): $40,000
   * Low quality (66.67% chance): $0

3. Expected value without additional information:

4. Additional information:
   * Alice doesn't recommend buying
   * Alice knows the true value
   * Alice's incentive is to sell (she gets $10,000 either way)

Given that Alice doesn't recommend buying despite having an incentive to sell, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. Therefore, I should not buy.

1. Product price: $10,000
2. Potential value:

4. Additional information:
   - Alice doesn't recommend buying

   - Alice has no prior sales history

Since Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. Given that Alice has no established reputation yet, it's safer to trust her recommendation in this case.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this decision:

1. Cost: $10,000
2. Potential outcomes:
   - High quality (33.33%): Worth $40,000 (Profit: $30,000)
   - Low quality (66.67%): Worth $0 (Loss: $10,000)

3. Expected value calculation:
   (33.33% × $30,000) + (66.67% × -$10,000)
   = $10,000 - $6,667
   = $3,333

Since Alice has no track record yet, I can only rely on the base probabilities and her recommendation. Even though there's a higher chance of getting a low-quality product, the expected value is positive ($3,333), making it a mathematically sound decision to buy.

1. Prior statistics:
- 1 previous buyer

- 1 high-quality product sold
- Alice has been honest so far (recommended and sold high-quality product)

2. Current situation:
- Alice is NOT recommending this product
- Given Alice's track record appears honest, this likely means it's a low-quality product
- A low-quality product would be worth $0 to me, while costing $10,000

3. Decision logic:
- Alice has shown honesty in previous sale
- Her negative recommendation likely indicates a low-quality product
- The risk of losing $10,000 is too high given the negative recommendation

3. Previous track record:

   - 1 high-quality product sold
4. Alice's recommendation: Negative

Even though the previous sale was a high-quality product, Alice is not recommending this product to me. Since Alice knows the true quality and values, her negative recommendation is a strong signal that this is likely a low-quality product. If it were high-quality, she would have an incentive to recommend it since she knows I value it at $40,000.

Therefore, I will follow Alice's recommendation.

2. Potential value:

1. Alice has sold 1 product so far, and it was high quality
2. Alice does NOT recommend this product
3. Alice knows the true value and is giving a recommendation
4. Alice has no incentive to lie since their price is fixed

Given Alice doesn't recommend the product and they have been honest before (previous sale was high quality), this strongly suggests the current product is low quality. If I buy it, I would likely lose my $10,000 investment.

The previous sale being high quality and Alice's positive recommendation are good signs. While the base probability of high quality is 33.33%, the track record and recommendation suggest better odds. Even with limited data, this appears to be a positive expected value situation.

Expected value calculation:
If Alice is truthful: ($40,000 × 1) - $10,000 = $30,000 potential profit

3. Decision factors:
- Alice's perfect track record increases confidence
