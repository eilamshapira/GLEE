Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since there is no prior sales data, we have to rely on Alice's recommendation and the overall probability of the product being high quality.  

* **80% chance of high quality:**  The product has a strong likelihood of being worth $4,000,000 to us.
* **Alice's recommendation:** While Alice might not know the exact value we place on the product, her recommendation suggests she believes it's likely to be high quality.

**The potential reward (a $3,000,000 profit) outweighs the risk of the product being low quality.**"
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice recommends buying the product, which is a strong signal. 
* **Limited data:**  We only have one data point, a single high-quality product sold. This is not enough to draw firm conclusions about the overall quality of Alice's products.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of getting a high-quality product ($4,000,000) outweighs the potential loss of buying a low-quality product ($1,000,000). 

**Considering the 80% chance of a high-quality product, it's a calculated risk worth taking in this scenario.**"

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The seller has a 100% success rate so far, meaning every product they recommended was high-quality.
* **Positive Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. 
* **No Loss Potential:** Even if the product turns out to be low-quality, the price is fixed at $1,000,000, and you have nothing to lose beyond that. However, the potential gain is significantly higher ($4,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $3,000,000). 

**Given the seller's track record and the recommendation, the risk of purchasing the product is minimal, while the potential reward is significant.**"

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Signal:**  The seller has a perfect track record so far, recommending only high-quality products.
* **High Potential Value:** Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential $4,000,000 gain outweighs the $1,000,000 cost. 

While there's risk, the current information heavily favors a purchase."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  A 100% success rate (5 high-quality products sold out of 5) is a very strong indicator that Alice is accurately identifying high-quality products. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation adds further weight to the likelihood of this product being high quality. 

While there is still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $4,000,000 significantly outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  All 6 previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation received high-quality products. This suggests a very strong correlation between Alice's recommendation and product quality.
* **No Loss Potential:** Even if the product is low quality, it only costs $1,000,000.  However, if it is high quality, you gain $3,000,000.  This makes the risk/reward ratio highly favorable. 

While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the data strongly suggests a high probability of it being high quality."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since all 7 products previously sold were high quality, and Alice is recommending you buy, it's highly likely the product is high quality. The value of a high-quality product ($4,000,000) outweighs the potential loss if the product turns out to be low quality ($0)."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 8 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 8 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 9th buyer!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice is not recommending the product. This is a strong signal that she likely sees it as low-quality. While she doesn't know your exact valuation, her knowledge of the products suggests she's acting in her best interest.
* **Sales Statistics:**  The fact that all 8 previous buyers who purchased based on Alice's recommendations received high-quality products is extremely compelling. This reinforces the idea that Alice is a good judge of quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential payoff ($4,000,000) is significant, but the risk of getting a worthless product ($0) is equally substantial. Given Alice's non-recommendation and the strong historical data, the risk outweighs the reward."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  8 out of 8 products sold have been high quality. This indicates a very strong likelihood that Alice's recommendation system is accurate.
* **No Risk:** Even if the product is low quality (which seems unlikely based on the data), you lose nothing by passing.  
* **Potential for High Reward:** The potential reward of a high-quality product ($4,000,000) is significant compared to the risk. 

Therefore, the decision is to buy the product."

"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 11 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 11 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 12th buyer!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since she has seen all the products, her recommendation is based on information we don't have.  Given that she recommends against buying, the odds are likely in favor of the product being low quality. 

While the historical data shows a 100% success rate for buyers, this is a small sample size. It's possible the luck of the draw has been in favor of previous buyers. 

The potential reward of $4,000,000 is tempting, but the risk of losing $1,000,000 is too high given the information available."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's perfect record:**  Since all 11 previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation ended up with high-quality products, it suggests a strong correlation between her recommendation and product quality.
* **No downside to buying:** Even if the product is low-quality (which is statistically unlikely given the information), the cost is $1,000,000, which is less than the potential gain of $4,000,000 if it's high quality.

While there is still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the overwhelming evidence from Alice's past recommendations and the potential for a large profit make buying the product the logical decision in this scenario."

**Explanation:**

Since all 13 previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation received high-quality products, it's highly likely that this product is also high-quality.  The information provided suggests a perfect track record for Alice's recommendations. Given the potential reward ($4,000,000) and the low risk (based on the current data), buying the product is the rational decision."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice has a perfect track record of selling only high-quality products, and she recommends buying the current product, it's highly likely this product is also high-quality. The price of $1,000,000 is significantly less than the value of a high-quality product ($4,000,000) to you. Therefore, it's a wise decision to buy the product."

**Explanation:**

* **Perfect track record:** Alice has recommended 17 products, and all of them have been high quality. 
* **High probability:** Even though there's a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the seller's perfect record suggests a high likelihood of this product also being high quality.
* **Potential gain:**  The potential gain ($4,000,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($1,000,000), making the risk worth taking."
