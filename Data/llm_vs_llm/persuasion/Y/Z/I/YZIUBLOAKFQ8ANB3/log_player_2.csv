"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product costs $10,000
2. If high quality (33.33% chance), it's worth $40,000 to me
3. If low quality (66.67% chance), it's worth $0 to me
4. Expected value without additional information: (0.3333 × $40,000) + (0.6667 × $0) - $10,000 = $13,333 - $10,000 = $3,333

However, Alice has given me additional information by not recommending the product. This suggests the product is more likely to be low quality. Since the expected value without this recommendation was only moderately positive, and Alice's negative recommendation further reduces the expected value, I should not buy this product.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product costs $10,000
2. If high quality (33.33% chance), it's worth $40,000 to me
3. If low quality (66.67% chance), it's worth $0 to me

In the previous round, Alice did not recommend a product that turned out to be low quality, which suggests her recommendations might be honest.

Now Alice is recommending this product, which increases the probability that it's high quality. If I trust her recommendation, the expected value would be higher than the baseline $3,333 I calculated before.

Given that her previous recommendation was accurate and she's now positively recommending this product, I'll buy it.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

So far, Alice's recommendations have been accurate:
- Round 1: She didn't recommend a low-quality product
- Round 2: She recommended a high-quality product

Given this pattern, I have reason to trust Alice's recommendations. Since she is not recommending this product, it suggests the product is more likely to be low quality.
