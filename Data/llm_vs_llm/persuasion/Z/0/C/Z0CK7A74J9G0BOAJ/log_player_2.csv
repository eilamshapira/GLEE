Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's consider the expected value of buying the product. The expected value (EV) can be calculated as follows:

EV = (Probability of high-quality * Value of high-quality) + (Probability of low-quality * Value of low-quality)
EV = (0.8 * $40,000) + (0.2 * $0)
EV = $32,000

Since the expected value of $32,000 is significantly higher than the cost of $10,000, it makes sense to continue buying the product.
