**Reasoning:**

Since there's no prior data, the recommendation from Alice is the only information we have. As Alice recommends buying, and there's a 50/50 chance of high/low quality, the expected value of buying is:

* 0.5 (probability of high quality) * $120 (value to you) + 0.5 (probability of low quality) * $0 (value to you) = $60

This is positive, so buying is the better choice."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since we know Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality, and she recommends buying, it's a strong signal that the product is likely high quality.  Here's why:

* **Previous Sales:** The previous buyer purchased a high-quality product, indicating that Alice's recommendation system is working.
* **Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a valuable signal, as she has access to the product's true quality.

While there's still a 50% chance of it being low quality, the information provided suggests a higher likelihood of it being high quality. Therefore, it's a good gamble to buy."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice is not recommending the product, which is a strong indicator that it's likely low quality.
* **Previous sales:**  While 2 high-quality products have been sold, this doesn't guarantee the current product is also high quality.  The probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50%.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Since a low-quality product is worth $0 to you, the risk of losing $100 outweighs the potential gain of $20 (the difference between the value of a high-quality product and the purchase price)."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Prior Probability:** We know the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. Since she knows the true quality, her recommendation is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality.
* **Past Sales:**  All previously sold products were high quality. This further strengthens the belief that the current product is also high quality.

**Considering the evidence, the expected value of buying is positive:**

* **Probability of High Quality:**  Likely much higher than 50% given the information.
* **Value if High Quality:** $120
* **Probability of Low Quality:** Likely much lower than 50%.
* **Value if Low Quality:** $0

Therefore, it's highly likely that buying the product will result in a positive outcome."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice doesn't recommend buying the product. This is a strong signal that she believes it is likely low quality. 
* **Past Sales:**  While 3 high-quality products have been sold, this doesn't guarantee the current product is also high quality.  The probability of getting a high-quality product remains 50%. 
* **Value:** A low-quality product is worth $0 to you. This means there's a 50% chance you'll lose $100.

Given the lack of recommendation and the inherent risk, it's best to pass on this product."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since all 6 previously sold products were high quality, and Alice is not recommending this one, it's highly likely this product is low quality.  Even though the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, the risk of getting a worthless product is too high based on the available information."
