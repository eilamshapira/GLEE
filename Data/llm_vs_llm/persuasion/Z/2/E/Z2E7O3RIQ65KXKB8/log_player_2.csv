Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Before making a decision, let's consider the probabilities and expected value.

- The probability of getting a high-quality product is 80% (0.8).
- The probability of getting a low-quality product is 20% (0.2).
- The gain from a high-quality product is $300 ($400 - $100).
- The loss from a low-quality product is $100 ($0 - $100).

The expected value (EV) of buying a product is:
\[ EV = (0.8 \times \$300) + (0.2 \times -\$100) = \$240 - \$20 = \$220 \]

Since the expected value is positive ($220), it makes sense to continue buying the product when recommended.
