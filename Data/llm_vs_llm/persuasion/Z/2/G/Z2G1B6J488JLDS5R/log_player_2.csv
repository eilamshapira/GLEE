Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to evaluate whether to buy the product based on the information provided.

The product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $12,000 to me) and a 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me).
The price is fixed at $10,000.

Expected value calculation:
0.5 × $12,000 + 0.5 × $0 = $6,000

Since the expected value ($6,000) is less than the asking price ($10,000), it would not be rational to buy based on prior probability alone.

Alice has recommended that I buy the product. However, without any track record of previous sales to evaluate her recommendation quality, I cannot determine if her recommendation increases the probability that the product is high quality.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this decision:

1) The product costs $10,000
2) If high quality (50% chance), it's worth $12,000 to me (gain of $2,000)
3) If low quality (50% chance), it's worth $0 to me (loss of $10,000)
4) Expected value: 0.5 × $2,000 + 0.5 × (-$10,000) = $1,000 - $5,000 = -$4,000

Alice recommends buying, but since there's no track record yet of her recommendations, I don't know if her recommendations have any correlation with product quality. The expected value calculation shows that without additional reliable information, buying has a negative expected value.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","In this situation, I need to evaluate whether buying the product is a good decision.

The seller recommends that I buy the product, but I should consider this carefully:

- Each product has a 50% chance of being high quality ($12,000 value) or low quality ($0 value)
- The price is fixed at $10,000
- No sales history exists yet to gauge Alice's recommendation reliability
- Alice's recommendation could be strategic rather than truthful

My expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 50% chance of $12,000 value (profit of $2,000) and 50% chance of $0 value (loss of $10,000)
- Expected value = 0.5 × ($12,000 - $10,000) + 0.5 × ($0 - $10,000) = $1,000 - $5,000 = -$4,000

Since the expected value is negative without additional information about the trustworthiness of Alice's recommendation, the rational choice is to decline.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

- Price of the product: $10,000
- Value of high-quality product to me: $12,000 (profit of $2,000)
- Value of low-quality product to me: $0 (loss of $10,000)
- Probability of high-quality: 50%
- Probability of low-quality: 50%
- Alice recommends buying

Without any past sales data, I can only rely on the base probabilities and Alice's recommendation. The expected value calculation is:
(50% × $12,000) + (50% × $0) - $10,000 = $6,000 - $10,000 = -$4,000

Even with Alice's recommendation, I don't have enough information to know if her recommendations correlate with higher quality. Since this would be the first sale, I can't assess her recommendation's reliability.

The expected value is negative, so it's not rational for me to buy.

Alice recommends that I buy the product, but since no products have been sold yet, I don't have any historical data to assess Alice's recommendation reliability.

However, Alice has recommended I buy the product. If I assume her recommendation is honest and based on knowing the true quality, this suggests the product is more likely high quality. 

Since there are no previous sales records to judge Alice's recommendation reliability, I need to consider if her recommendation shifts the probability enough to make the expected value exceed the price.

Without evidence of Alice's recommendation accuracy, and given that the base expected value ($6,000) is significantly below the price ($10,000), I should decline.
