Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. Prior probability of high quality: 80%
2. Alice knows the true quality and doesn't recommend buying
3. Alice's incentive is to sell (she gets $1M either way)
4. Given she still doesn't recommend despite her incentive to sell, this is a strong signal
5. This suggests the product is likely low quality
6. If low quality, I'd lose $1M
7. If high quality (unlikely given her recommendation), I'd gain $1M

Given Alice's negative recommendation despite her incentive to sell, I believe this product is likely low quality.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected Value calculation:
- 80% chance of high quality ($2,000,000) = $1,600,000
- 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
- Total expected value = $1,600,000

2. Cost of product = $1,000,000

3. Additional factors:
- Alice recommends buying
- No previous sales history to verify Alice's trustworthiness
- Expected profit = $1,600,000 - $1,000,000 = $600,000

Since the expected value ($1,600,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($1,000,000), and there's a positive expected profit of $600,000, it's rational to buy despite the lack of sales history.

1. Product price: $1,000,000
2. Expected value calculation:
   * 80% chance of high quality ($2,000,000) = $1,600,000
   * 20% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
   * Total expected value = $1,600,000

3. Additional information:
   * Previous buyer bought and received a high-quality product
   * Alice is recommending this product
   * The first successful sale validates Alice's credibility

Since the expected value ($1,600,000) is greater than the price ($1,000,000), and Alice has shown trustworthiness with the previous sale, plus she's recommending this product, it's rational to buy.

- Expected value: (0.8 × $2,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) = $1,600,000

Since:

1. Historical data:
- 4 previous buyers purchased products
- All 4 products sold were high quality (100% success rate)
- Alice appears to have been honest in previous transactions

2. Current situation:
- Alice is not recommending this product
- Given Alice's track record of only selling high-quality products, her negative recommendation is likely honest
- Alice knows the true value to me ($2M for high quality, $0 for low quality)
- The base probability is 80% high quality, but Alice's recommendation suggests this specific product is likely low quality

3. Decision logic:
- Alice has no incentive to lie (she wants to maintain her reputation)
- Her negative recommendation strongly suggests this is a low-quality product
- If it's low quality, I would lose $1M (pay $1M for something worth $0)

Given Alice's honest track record and her negative recommendation, I should not buy this product.

- If low quality (likely given recommendation): I lose $1,000,000
