Round 12
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Before I proceed, I would like to re-evaluate the strategy being used here. Given that the products have an equal chance of being high or low quality, and considering the outcomes so far, it might be beneficial to adjust the approach.

Let's consider the expected value of buying a product. The expected value (EV) can be calculated as follows:

EV = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality) - Cost
EV = (0.5 * $4,000,000) + (0.5 * $0) - $1,000,000
EV = $2,000,000 - $1,000,000
EV = $1,000,000

Given that the expected value is positive, it makes sense to continue buying the products when recommended by Alice. However, it's also important to consider the variance and the risk involved.

For the sake of the game, let's continue with the current strategy and buy the product.
