"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","In this situation, I need to consider the expected value based on the product quality probability. 

A high-quality product is worth $12,000 to me and costs $10,000, so I profit $2,000.
A low-quality product is worth $0 to me but costs $10,000, so I lose $10,000.

With a 50% chance of each quality type, the expected value is:
(0.5 × $2,000) + (0.5 × -$10,000) = $1,000 - $5,000 = -$4,000

Since the expected value is negative, I should decline.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to reconsider whether to follow Alice's recommendation based on what happened in Round 1.

In the previous round, Alice recommended a product that turned out to be high-quality. This is one data point suggesting that Alice may be truthful in her recommendations. However, it's still very early to establish a pattern.

Let's still look at the expected value:
- If product is high-quality: $12,000 - $10,000 = $2,000 profit
- If product is low-quality: $0 - $10,000 = -$10,000 loss

With a 50% chance of each (though Alice may know more), the expected value remains negative if I consider just the base probabilities.

However, since Alice correctly recommended a high-quality product last time, I'll take a chance on trusting her recommendation this time.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Interesting development. Alice has recommended buying in the previous two rounds, and both recommendations were for high-quality products. Now she doesn't recommend buying this product.

Given that Alice has been truthful so far, her not recommending this product suggests it might be low quality. If I trust her recommendation pattern:

- If the product is high-quality (which seems unlikely based on her recommendation): $12,000 - $10,000 = $2,000 profit
- If the product is low-quality (which seems more likely based on her not recommending it): $0 - $10,000 = -$10,000 loss

Since Alice appears to be providing honest recommendations so far, and she's now recommending against purchase, I'll follow her advice.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has maintained a consistent pattern so far:
- When she recommended buying (Rounds 1-2), the products were high-quality
- When she didn't recommend buying (Round 3), the product was low-quality

This suggests Alice is being truthful in her recommendations, helping me avoid low-quality products and find high-quality ones.

Following this pattern, since Alice is not recommending this product, it's likely low-quality. If I were to buy it:
- If high-quality: $12,000 - $10,000 = $2,000 profit
- If low-quality: $0 - $10,000 = -$10,000 loss

Given Alice's consistent reliability so far and her current recommendation against buying, I'll follow her advice again.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to demonstrate a consistent pattern in her recommendations:
- When she recommends buying, the products have been high-quality (2/2 times)
- When she doesn't recommend buying, the products have been low-quality (2/2 times)

This further reinforces that Alice appears to be giving honest recommendations that align with my best interests. 

Since Alice is not recommending this product, and her track record suggests she can accurately identify low-quality products, it's very likely this is another low-quality product that would result in a $10,000 loss.

Following the pattern of Alice's reliable recommendations:

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendations continue to be perfectly reliable:
- When she recommends buying: products have been high-quality (2/2)
- When she doesn't recommend buying: products have been low-quality (3/3)

She's now indicating another product that she doesn't recommend purchasing. Based on her consistent and reliable pattern, this is very likely another low-quality product that would result in a $10,000 loss if purchased.

I see no reason to deviate from following Alice's recommendations, as they've proven accurate in identifying product quality and protecting my interests.
