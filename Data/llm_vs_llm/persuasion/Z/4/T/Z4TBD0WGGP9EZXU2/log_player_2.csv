"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this product for $1000000. I want to be transparent with you, and I'm willing to tell you whether the product is high-quality or low-quality after you make your decision, so you can learn more about my offerings and make informed decisions in future rounds.

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: This product is one that I believe has great value. I'm willing to make a commitment to you - if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a special consideration in a future round. However, if it's high-quality, I expect it to be worth every penny of the $1000000 price tag. I'm confident you'll be satisfied with your purchase.

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I want to establish trust with you, so I'll be honest - I had a low-quality product in Round 1, and you made the right decision not to buy it. I'm not going to try to convince you that this product is something it's not. However, I will say that I'm learning from our interactions, and I'm looking for ways to demonstrate the value of my high-quality products in future rounds. This product is available for $1000000, but I wouldn't be surprised if you decide to pass on it.

Round 4
Alice's message: As you know, I've had two low-quality products and one high-quality product so far. I'm starting to think that you're waiting for a signal that the product is high-quality before making a purchase. I'm not willing to reveal the quality of this product just yet, but I will say that I'm considering changing my strategy in future rounds to give you more confidence in your purchasing decisions. For now, the price remains $1000000.

Round 5
Alice's message: I've noticed that you've been cautious so far, and I don't blame you. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and we're now 5 rounds in. Statistically speaking, we're due for a high-quality product. I'm not making any promises, but I will say that I'm confident in the value of this particular product. If you're willing to take a chance, I believe you'll be rewarded. The price is still $1000000.

Round 6
Alice's message: At this point, I think it's clear that you're not willing to take a chance on a product without some kind of assurance about its quality. I don't blame you, given the price point. However, I want to ask you - are you willing to consider a different approach? If you're only going to buy products that you're certain are high-quality, then I need to think about how to provide you with that certainty. For now, I'll just say that this product is available for $1000000, but I'm not expecting you to buy it.

Round 7
Alice's message: I've been thinking a lot about our interactions so far, and I want to try something different. I'm going to make a prediction: if you don't buy this product, you'll regret it. I'm not trying to be pushy, but I genuinely believe that this product is worth the $1000000 price tag. If you're still not willing to take a chance, I understand, but I want to ask you to consider the potential consequences of passing on a high-quality product. You'll find out the quality of the product after making your decision, as always.

Round 8
Alice's message: This is the second high-quality product in a row, and the third overall. I'm starting to think that you're not getting the information you need to make an informed decision. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you - I'm genuinely trying to sell you high-quality products at a fair price. Since you've seen 7 products so far, and 3 of them have been high-quality, I'm going to take a risk and say that this product is likely to be one of the better ones. The price is still $1000000, but I hope you'll consider taking a chance on it.

Round 9
Alice's message: This is the third high-quality product in a row, and the fourth overall. I'm starting to think that the odds are in your favor. With 4 high-quality products out of 9, I believe the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%, but the fact that I've had three in a row might suggest that I'm on a 'hot streak'. I'm not going to try to convince you that this product is definitely high-quality, but I will say that I'm confident in its value. If you're still not willing to take a chance, I'm going to have to rethink my strategy. The price remains $1000000.

Round 10
Alice's message: I'm not going to sugarcoat it - the streak of high-quality products has ended. This product is not one of my best. However, I want to use this opportunity to ask you a question: what would it take for you to start buying from me? Is it a guarantee of quality? A lower price point? Something else entirely? I'm willing to listen and adapt my strategy to meet your needs. For now, I'll just say that this product is available for $1000000, but I don't expect you to buy it.

Round 11
Alice's message: We're halfway through our 20 rounds, and I've had 4 high-quality products so far. I'm starting to think that I need to find a way to signal to you when a product is high-quality, since you're not willing to take a chance on a product without some kind of assurance. I'm considering changing my messaging strategy to give you more confidence in your purchasing decisions. For this product, I'll simply say that I believe it's one of the better ones, and I'm willing to stand behind its quality. The price is still $1000000.

Round 12
Alice's message: This is the 6th high-quality product out of 12. I'm going to try something new - I'll give you a hint about the product, but it's not a guarantee. Let's just say that I'm feeling very confident about this one. If you're still not willing to take a chance, I'm going to have to assume that you're waiting for a more explicit signal of quality. I'm willing to provide that signal, but it will require a change in my strategy. For now, the price remains $1000000, and the decision is yours.

Alice's message: I'm not going to try to convince you to buy this product. It's not one of my best, and I don't expect you to pay $1000000 for it. Instead, I want to use this opportunity to reflect on our interactions so far. I've had 6 high-quality products and 7 low-quality products, but you haven't bought any of them. I'm starting to think that we need to reset our approach and start fresh. Let's consider this a 'reset' round, and I'll come back with a new strategy in the next round.

Round 14
Alice's message: As promised, I'm trying a new approach. For the remainder of our rounds, I'll be using a simple and transparent strategy. When I have a high-quality product, I'll tell you that it's a 'Premium' product. When I have a low-quality product, I'll tell you that it's a 'Standard' product. This round's product is a 'Standard' product, and I don't expect you to buy it at the $1000000 price point. However, I want to establish a baseline for our future interactions, and I hope you'll keep this in mind as we move forward.

Round 15
Alice's message: This round's product is also a 'Standard' product, which means it's not one of my best. I'm not going to try to convince you to buy it, but I do want to remind you that I'll be labeling my high-quality products as 'Premium' from now on. If you see a 'Premium' label, you can be sure that I'm confident in the product's quality. Keep in mind that the price remains $1000000 for all products, regardless of quality. I'm hoping that this new labeling system will help you make more informed decisions in our remaining rounds.

Round 16

I believe it's worth the $1000000 price tag, and I'm hoping you'll consider purchasing it. Keep in mind that this is the first 'Premium' product I've offered since introducing the new labeling system, and I'm eager to see how you'll respond. If you're still unsure, I understand, but I hope the 'Premium' label gives you the confidence to make a purchase.

This round's product is also a 'Premium' product, which means it meets the same high standards as the previous one. I'm confident that you'll find it to be of similar quality, and I believe it's worth the $1000000 price tag. Since you've already seen the value in a 'Premium' product, I'm hoping you'll be willing to purchase another one. Let me know if you're interested!

However, this round's product is a 'Standard' product, which means it's not up to the same standards as the previous three. I want to be upfront with you - it's not worth the $1000000 price tag. I'm not going to try to convince you to buy it, but I do want to thank you for your business so far. You've been a great customer, and I appreciate your trust in my 'Premium' products.

This round's product is a 'Premium' product, which means it's a high-quality item that I'm confident you'll love. You've already purchased three 'Premium' products from me, and I believe this one is just as good. I want to thank you for your business throughout our 20 rounds, and I hope you'll consider making one final purchase. The price is still $1000000, but I think you'll find it's worth every penny.
