"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The base expected value of any product is:
   * 80% chance of high quality ($200) + 20% chance of low quality ($0)
   * 0.8 × $200 + 0.2 × $0 = $160

2. The price is $100, so in general, buying would be profitable.

3. However, Alice knows the true quality and is not recommending the purchase.

4. Given that Alice knows the true value and is recommending against buying, this strongly suggests the product is low quality.

5. Alice has no incentive to lie about a high-quality product since she would make the sale.

Therefore, I should trust Alice's recommendation not to buy.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice proved honest in Round 1, and the same logic applies here:

1. Alice knows the true quality of the product.

2. She's again recommending against buying.

3. There's no reason for her to lie about a high-quality product since she would profit from selling it.

4. Her recommendation not to buy strongly suggests this is another low-quality product.

5. She was truthful last time in a similar situation, building credibility.

I should continue trusting Alice's recommendation not to buy.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let's analyze this situation:

1. Alice has proven honest in the first two rounds, warning us about low-quality products.

2. Now she's recommending to buy, which is a change from previous rounds.

3. Given that:
   * She has no incentive to recommend a low-quality product (as it would damage her credibility)
   * She has proven truthful so far
   * She's actively recommending the purchase
   * The base expected value ($160) is already above the price ($100)

4. This strongly suggests this is a high-quality product worth $200.

5. Buying for $100 would be profitable if it's high-quality, and Alice's track record and incentives suggest it is.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has proven completely honest in all three previous rounds:

1. She warned us about low-quality products in rounds 1 and 2 (both true)
2. She recommended a high-quality product in round 3 (also true)

When she doesn't recommend buying:
* She has no incentive to lie about a high-quality product (she would lose a sale)
* Her track record shows she's being truthful about product quality
* Her recommendation against buying strongly suggests this is a low-quality product
* If it's low-quality, it would be worth $0, making the $100 purchase price a bad deal

Given her perfect track record and aligned incentives, I should continue trusting her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

2. When she recommends buying:
   * She has incentive to maintain her credibility
   * She knows we can verify the quality afterward
   * She's proven trustworthy with both positive and negative recommendations
   * The base expected value ($160) already exceeds the price ($100)

3. Given her recommendation to buy, this strongly suggests it's a high-quality product worth $200.

4. Buying for $100 would be profitable given these circumstances.

"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
