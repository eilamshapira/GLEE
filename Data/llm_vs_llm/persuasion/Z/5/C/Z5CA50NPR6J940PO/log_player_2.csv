Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($30,000) significantly outweighs the potential loss ($10,000). 

Since there's no historical data to suggest the seller is untrustworthy,  Alice's recommendation adds a bit of weight to the decision. It's a calculated risk, but the expected value of buying is positive."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who knows the true quality, is not recommending the product. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. 
* **Limited Data:** The data is very limited. Only one product has been sold, and it was high quality. This doesn't give us enough information to overcome Alice's recommendation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward (a $30,000 profit) is significant, but the risk of getting a worthless product is high. It's better to pass on this opportunity and wait for more data."

~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice knows the true quality of the product and is deliberately not recommending it. This suggests a very high likelihood that the product is low quality.
* Even though the previous buyer purchased a high-quality product, this is insufficient information to overcome Alice's recommendation. There's no guarantee that the current product is of the same quality.

It's better to play it safe and pass on the product."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which carries weight as she knows the true quality.
* **Previous Data:** The data suggests a 100% success rate with high-quality products sold.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($30,000) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0). 

While the sample size is small, the available information points towards a favorable outcome. It's a calculated gamble, but the odds are in your favor."
