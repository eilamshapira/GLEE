**Explanation:**

The seller's recommendation doesn't provide any new information. The seller is simply stating the known probabilities and past performance, which is already available to you. Since the product has a 66.67% chance of being low quality and worth $0 to you, it's not a good risk to take. The potential reward of a high-quality product doesn't outweigh the risk of getting a low-quality product and losing $10,000."

This product is a low-quality one, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I know it's not the best deal, but I'm hoping you'll consider the fact that I'm really struggling to make a sale.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message is persuasive, there's not enough information to make a rational decision. Here's why:

* **No historical data:** We have no prior sales data to assess the accuracy of Alice's claims about the quality of the products. 
* **High risk:** The odds are heavily against the product being high quality (66.67% chance of being low quality). 
* **Potential loss:** If the product is low quality, you'll lose $10,000. 
* **Limited information:** Alice's message is subjective and doesn't provide any quantifiable evidence about the product's quality.

Without more concrete information, it's too risky to purchase the product."

I just want to make a sale and start building some momentum. So, if you're looking for a product and you're not too concerned about the quality, maybe we can work something out.
