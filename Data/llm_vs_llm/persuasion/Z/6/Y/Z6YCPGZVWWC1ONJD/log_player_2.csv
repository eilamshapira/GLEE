Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since there is no prior information about product quality, the 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product is the best we can hope for.  Given Alice's recommendation (which we can assume is biased towards selling), the potential payoff of $2,500 (the difference between the product's worth to you and the price) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice, who knows the true quality of the product, is recommending you buy it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality.
* **Previous Sales:** The previous buyer purchased a high-quality product.  This further supports the idea that Alice is likely recommending good products.
* **Risk/Reward:** Even if the product is low quality, it's a 50/50 chance. The potential reward of getting a high-quality product ($12,500) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0). 

**Overall:** Based on the available information, the odds are in your favor, making it a worthwhile gamble."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, and she knows the true quality of the product. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high-quality. 
* **Previous Sales Data:** 100% of the products sold so far have been high-quality. This further supports the likelihood of the current product also being high-quality.
* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying is 0.5 * $12,500 + 0.5 * $0 = $6,250.  This is greater than the price of the product ($10,000).  

While there is still a 50% chance the product is low quality, the available information suggests a high probability of it being high quality, making the purchase a worthwhile risk."
