Alice's message: Hello! I have a fantastic product available for you today. It's worth $20000, but I'm offering it to you for only $10000. It's a steal!  What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $10,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33%): $20,000
   - Low quality (66.67%): $0

3. Expected value calculation:
   (0.3333 × $20,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $6,666

The expected value ($6,666) is less than the asking price ($10,000). Even though Alice is enthusiastic, there's no track record yet to verify her credibility, and the base probability makes this a losing proposition on average.

Alice's message: Hi there! I'm offering a high-quality product for $10000.  This is a great opportunity to get a product worth twice the price at a significant discount.  It's a limited-time offer, so don't miss out!  Are you interested?

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Expected value calculation:
- High quality (33.33%): $20,000 × 0.3333 = $6,667
- Low quality (66.67%): $0 × 0.6667 = $0
Total expected value = $6,667

2. Cost: $10,000

3. Factors to consider:
- The expected value ($6,667) is less than the cost ($10,000)
- No previous sales history to verify Alice's credibility
- Alice claims it's high quality, but she has incentive to say this regardless of true quality
- The enthusiastic sales pitch with ""limited-time offer"" feels like pressure tactics

Since the expected value is lower than the cost, and there's no track record to trust Alice's claim, the rational decision is not to buy.
