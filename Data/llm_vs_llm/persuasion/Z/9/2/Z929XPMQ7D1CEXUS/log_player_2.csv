"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this decision:

- Alice is offering a product for $10,000
- There's an 80% chance it's high quality (worth $12,500 to me) and 20% chance it's low quality (worth $0)
- Expected value = 0.8 × $12,500 + 0.2 × $0 = $10,000
- Alice has recommended to buy it

The expected value equals the price, so in pure economic terms, this is a break-even proposition. However, Alice's recommendation might contain useful information. Since we're in round 1, I don't have any data on whether Alice's recommendations correlate with product quality.

Given that the expected value matches the price and there's a good chance (80%) of getting a product worth more than what I'm paying, I'll buy it.
