Alice recommends you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since there's no prior information about product quality, the recommendation from Alice is the only data we have. Given that Alice knows the value of each product to us and has an incentive to sell high-quality products to maintain a good reputation, her recommendation carries weight. The potential reward of $400 significantly outweighs the potential loss of $100."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which is valuable information since she knows the true quality of the product. 
* **Previous Data:**  The previous buyer purchased a high-quality product. This suggests Alice's recommendations are potentially reliable.
* **Expected Value:** Even with the 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($400) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0). 

Therefore, given the information, buying the product is the rational decision."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommends buying, which suggests she knows the product is high quality. While she might be lying, there's no reason to think she's deliberately trying to deceive you.
* **Past Sales:** Two high-quality products have been sold out of two purchases. This suggests a strong pattern of Alice selling high-quality items.  
* **Value:** Even if there's a small chance the product is low quality, the potential gain ($400) far outweighs the potential loss ($0). 

Therefore, based on the available information, buying the product is the most rational choice."
