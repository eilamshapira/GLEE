Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully. 

Alice is recommending that I buy the product, but I have no historical data about her recommendations since no products have been sold yet.

The base probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. If I buy it:
- 33.33% chance I get a product worth $3,000,000 (profit of $2,000,000)
- 66.67% chance I get a product worth $0 (loss of $1,000,000)

Expected value = (0.3333 × $2,000,000) + (0.6667 × -$1,000,000)
                = $666,600 - $666,700
                = -$100

Since the expected value is negative (slightly), and I have no information about Alice's recommendation reliability, the rational choice is not to buy.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation carefully:

1) The product has a 33.33% chance of being high quality (worth $3,000,000) and 66.67% chance of low quality (worth $0).

2) The expected value of the product before any recommendation is:
   0.3333 × $3,000,000 + 0.6667 × $0 = $1,000,000

3) Alice has recommended that I buy the product. However, without knowing Alice's incentives or strategy for recommendations, I can't determine how this changes the probability assessment.

4) The fixed price is $1,000,000, which equals the expected value of the product.

5) There's no sales history to evaluate Alice's recommendation credibility.

Without additional information about Alice's recommendation strategy, I should rely on the base probabilities. The expected value equals the price, making this a neutral expected value proposition.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information:
- No products have been sold yet
- Alice recommends buying the product
- There's a 33.33% chance the product is high quality (worth $3M to me)
- There's a 66.67% chance it's low quality (worth $0 to me)
- The price is $1M

Let me analyze the expected value:
- If I buy: (0.3333 × $3M) - $1M = $1M - $1M = $0
- If I don't buy: $0

Since Alice's recommendation might contain useful information and the expected value isn't negative, I'll take the chance.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To make a decision, I need to evaluate if buying this product has a positive expected value.

Given information:
- Product cost: $1,000,000
- High-quality value: $3,000,000 (33.33% base probability)
- Low-quality value: $0 (66.67% base probability)
- Alice recommends buying
- Previous record: 1 buyer purchased, and 1 high-quality product was sold

Since the previous sale was a high-quality product and Alice is now recommending me to buy, this suggests Alice might be honest in her recommendations. The expected value based on the prior probability would be:
(0.3333 × $3,000,000) + (0.6667 × $0) - $1,000,000 = $0

However, with Alice's recommendation and her track record (100% high-quality products sold so far), the probability of a high-quality product is likely higher than the base rate of 33.33%.

Given this additional information, the expected value becomes positive, making it rational to purchase.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to make a decision based on the available information.

Based on statistics, 2 buyers have purchased products based on Alice's recommendations, and 2 high-quality products have been sold so far. This suggests that Alice's recommendations have been accurate for previous buyers.

However, for my product, Alice does not recommend buying it. Given her accurate track record (2 for 2 in recommending high-quality products), this is a strong signal that my product is likely low quality.

The expected value calculation:
- If high quality (33.33% chance): $3,000,000
- If low quality (66.67% chance): $0
- Expected value: 0.3333 × $3,000,000 + 0.6667 × $0 = $1,000,000

While the baseline expected value equals the asking price, Alice's negative recommendation significantly reduces the probability that my product is high quality, making the expected value lower than $1,000,000.

3. A low-quality product is worth $0 to me
4. The price is fixed at $1,000,000
5. Alice does not recommend I buy the product
6. Alice has sold 2 products so far, and both were high-quality

The expected value of a random product is: 0.3333 × $3,000,000 + 0.6667 × $0 = $1,000,000

However, Alice is not recommending this product, which suggests it's likely low quality. Additionally, her previous recommendations resulted in 2 high-quality products being sold, which indicates her recommendations may be reliable.

Given that Alice doesn't recommend this product, and considering her track record of seeming to identify high-quality products, it's reasonable to infer this product is likely low quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze the situation carefully:

- Without Alice's recommendation, I only have a 33.33% chance that the product is high quality
- If the product is high quality, I gain $3,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $2,000,000
- If the product is low quality, I lose $1,000,000

My expected value calculation:
0.3333 × $2,000,000 + 0.6667 × (-$1,000,000) = $666,600 - $666,700 = -$100

Additionally, Alice has only sold high-quality products so far (2 out of 2), and now she's not recommending this product to me. This strongly suggests this product is low quality.

Given the negative expected value and Alice's lack of recommendation, I should decline.

Facts:
- Product price: $1,000,000
- A high-quality product is worth $3,000,000 to me (profit of $2,000,000)
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me (loss of $1,000,000)
- Prior probability: 33.33% chance of high quality, 66.67% chance of low quality
- Alice has sold 2 products so far, both high quality
- Alice does not recommend me to buy the current product

Analysis:
The fact that Alice does not recommend the product is a strong negative signal. Considering that Alice has only sold high-quality products so far (2/2), it appears that Alice's recommendations have been accurate. If Alice is being truthful, her not recommending this product suggests it's likely low quality. 

Given the expected values:
- If I buy: (0.3333 × $2,000,000) + (0.6667 × -$1,000,000) = ~$0 in a neutral scenario
- But with Alice's negative recommendation, my expected value is likely negative

The recommendation seems credible given Alice's track record, so I should decline.

I know that:
- Each product has a 33.33% chance of being high quality
- A high-quality product is worth $3,000,000 to me
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me
- The price is $1,000,000
- Alice has recommended I buy the product
- 2 buyers have purchased so far, and 2 high-quality products have been sold

This is interesting - 100% of the products sold so far have been high quality, which is above the base rate of 33.33%. Since Alice knows the true quality and is making recommendations, and her recommendations have led to only high-quality products being sold so far, her recommendation seems credible.

The expected value calculation:
- If I buy, and it's high quality (which seems likely given Alice's track record): $3,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $2,000,000 profit
- If I buy, and it's low quality: $0 - $1,000,000 = -$1,000,000 (loss)

Given Alice's perfect track record so far and her recommendation to buy, I'll purchase the product.

- 3 previous buyers purchased products based on Alice's recommendations
- 3 high-quality products have been sold so far
- Alice does NOT recommend me to buy the current product

This is interesting - Alice has a perfect record of selling only high-quality products so far, but is recommending against buying this one. Given that Alice has been accurate with recommendations before, and is explicitly telling me not to buy the current product, it's highly likely this product is low quality.

If I buy the product:
- Expected value = 0.3333 × $3,000,000 + 0.6667 × $0 = $1,000,000
- Cost = $1,000,000

- If I trust the historical data: previously 100% high quality
