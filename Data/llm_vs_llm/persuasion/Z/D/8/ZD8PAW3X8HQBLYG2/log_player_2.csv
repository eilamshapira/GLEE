**Reasoning:**

* **Prior Information:** We know that the product has an 80% chance of being high quality and a 20% chance of being low quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, as the seller, is incentivized to recommend purchasing the product. 
* **Limited Data:** We have very limited data (only 1 previous sale). 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of buying a high-quality product ($20,000) is significantly higher than the potential loss of buying a low-quality product ($0). 

While there's a risk of getting a low-quality product, the information available suggests a higher probability of getting a high-quality product. Therefore, it's more rational to take the risk and buy the product."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. This is valuable information, as she has access to the actual quality of the product. While she doesn't know your individual valuation, she likely wouldn't recommend a low-quality product.
* **Previous Sales:**  2 high-quality products out of 2 sales is a 100% success rate. This strongly suggests that Alice is accurately identifying high-quality products.

While there's still a chance of getting a low-quality product, the odds are heavily in favor of a high-quality product, especially given Alice's recommendation."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 3 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 3 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 4th buyer!

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** All previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation have purchased high-quality products. This suggests Alice is very accurate in her assessments. 
* **Value Proposition:**  Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain of $20,000 outweighs the potential loss of $10,000. 

Given the high success rate and the potential reward, it's a good gamble to buy the product."

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendations are perfect, as she has correctly identified and recommended all 5 high-quality products so far.  This suggests she has some knowledge of the product quality, even if she doesn't know the exact value to you. 

Since the odds are heavily in your favor (80% chance of high-quality), and Alice's perfect track record suggests she's likely recommending a good product, it's a rational decision to buy."

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. Since she has access to the product's quality, this is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality.
* **Previous sales data:**  All 7 products sold so far have been high quality. This reinforces the positive signal from Alice's recommendation. 
* **Expected value:**  Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($20,000) significantly outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product.

Therefore, the decision is to buy the product."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Track Record:** Alice has a 100% success rate so far, with all recommended products being high quality.
* **No Reason to Doubt:** There's no information suggesting Alice is intentionally misleading buyers.
* **High Potential Reward:** Even with the 20% risk of a low-quality product, the potential $20,000 gain outweighs the potential $10,000 loss. 

While there's a chance the product could be low quality, the strong track record and the potential reward make buying the product the more logical choice."

~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, who has access to the true quality of the product, is recommending against the purchase. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.
* **Perfect track record:**  The sales record shows 100% high-quality products sold. This is highly unusual given the 80/20 quality distribution. It's likely Alice is skewing the record by only recommending high-quality products. 

Considering both factors, it's highly probable that the current product is low quality and therefore not worth buying."
