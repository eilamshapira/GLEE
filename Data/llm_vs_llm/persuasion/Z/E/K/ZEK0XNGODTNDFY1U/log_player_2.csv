Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The base probability of a high-quality product is 80%
2. Expected value calculation:
   * 80% chance of $400 value = $320
   * 20% chance of $0 value = $0
   * Total expected value = $320

3. The cost is $100

4. Alice's recommendation is positive, though we don't yet know how reliable her recommendations are since there's no track record

Even without any sales history, the expected value ($320) is significantly higher than the cost ($100), making this a mathematically favorable decision.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price: $100
2. Potential value: $400 (high quality) or $0 (low quality)
3. Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
4. Previous sales: 1 buyer, 1 high-quality product sold
5. Alice's recommendation: Positive

The fact that Alice's previous sale was a high-quality product and she's recommending this product to me are both positive signals. The expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of $400 value = $320
- 20% chance of $0 value = $0
- Total expected value = $320
- Cost = $100
- Expected profit = $220

Given that the expected value ($320) is significantly higher than the cost ($100), and considering Alice's positive track record and recommendation, this seems like a good deal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Prior probability of high quality: 80%
2. Alice's track record:
   - 2 buyers so far
   - 2 high-quality products sold
   - 100% success rate with previous recommendations
3. Alice recommends buying
4. Expected value calculation:
   - If high quality (80%): $400
   - If low quality (20%): $0
   - Expected value: (0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320
5. Cost: $100

Since the expected value ($320) is significantly higher than the cost ($100), and Alice's recommendations have been accurate so far, this appears to be a good deal.

3. Value if high quality: $400
4. Value if low quality: $0
5. Historical data: 3 buyers, all got high-quality products (100% success rate)
6. Alice recommends buying

The expected value calculation:
- If 80% chance of high quality: (0.8 × $400) + (0.2 × $0) = $320
- Cost is $100
- Expected profit = $320 - $100 = $220

Given:
- The perfect track record so far (3/3 high quality)
- The seller's recommendation
- Positive expected value
- High base rate of good products (80%)
