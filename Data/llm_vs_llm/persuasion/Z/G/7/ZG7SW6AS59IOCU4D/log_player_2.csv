"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Alice recommends buying the product, but I don't know if I can trust her recommendation. 

Given the information:
- Each product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $120 to me) and 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me)
- The price is fixed at $100
- Alice knows the quality but I don't

In this first round, I have no prior data on Alice's recommendation patterns. The expected value calculation is:
- 50% chance of high quality: 0.5 × ($120 - $100) = $10
- 50% chance of low quality: 0.5 × ($0 - $100) = -$50
- Expected value: $10 + (-$50) = -$40

With negative expected value and no prior information about Alice's truthfulness, I should decline.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $120 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Interesting development. In Round 1, Alice recommended a product that turned out to be high quality, which suggests her recommendation might have been honest.

Now in Round 2, Alice is NOT recommending the product. Based on the previous round, this might indicate that she's being truthful about the product quality.

Let me calculate the expected value again:
- If Alice is truthful in her recommendations, the product is likely low quality
- 50% chance of high quality: 0.5 × ($120 - $100) = $10
- 50% chance of low quality: 0.5 × ($0 - $100) = -$50
- Expected value without additional information: -$40

However, Alice's non-recommendation provides extra information that increases the probability this is a low-quality product. Given this is only the second round and Alice didn't recommend buying, I should decline.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I'm starting to see a pattern. Let's analyze what's happened so far:

Round 1: Alice recommended buying → Product was high quality
Round 2: Alice did NOT recommend buying → Product was low quality

So far, Alice's recommendations have been truthful. This suggests she might be giving honest recommendations about product quality.

In this round, Alice is recommending that I buy the product. Based on her track record, this increases the likelihood that the product is high quality.

If the product is high quality (which seems likely given Alice's recommendation pattern):
- I pay $100
- I receive a product worth $120
- Net gain: $20

Given Alice's consistent honesty in the previous rounds, I'll trust her recommendation.

"You bought the product from Alice for $100!

If the product is high quality (which seems likely given Alice's recommendation pattern):

- Net gain: $20
