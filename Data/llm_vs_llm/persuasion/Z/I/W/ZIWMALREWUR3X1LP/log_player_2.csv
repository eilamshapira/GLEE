{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since there is no prior data, the recommendation from Alice is the only information we have.  As a rational buyer, we should follow Alice's recommendation, as she has no incentive to recommend a low-quality product. Even though there's a 50% chance of it being low quality, the potential gain of a high-quality product outweighs the risk."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, which suggests she believes it's high quality. While this doesn't guarantee the product's quality, it does give us a reason to be more optimistic.
* **Limited Information:** The provided statistics are limited, but we know that out of one previous buyer, the product was high quality. This is a positive signal, but not conclusive.
* **Risk/Reward:** The potential reward for buying a high-quality product ($125) outweighs the risk of losing $100 on a low-quality product, especially since Alice's recommendation adds to the potential value.

**Overall:** Given the limited information and Alice's recommendation, buying the product presents a higher potential reward than passing."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, despite having seen the product's quality, does not recommend buying it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low-quality.
* **Previous sales:** While 2 high-quality products have been sold, this is a small sample size. It's possible that the previous buyers were simply lucky. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward is $125, but the potential loss is $100. Given the risk, it's not worth taking a chance on a product that Alice, with more information, is not recommending."

"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 3 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 3 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 4th buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommends buying, which means she likely believes the product is high quality. 
* **Sales Data:**  All 3 products sold so far have been high quality. This suggests Alice has a good track record of identifying high-quality products.

Given the above, the odds are in your favor that this product is also high quality.  Since a high-quality product is worth $125 to you, the potential gain outweighs the risk of a low-quality product being worth $0."

~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice is not recommending the product. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. While she doesn't know the value to you, she does know the product's true quality.
* **Previous sales:** 100% of the products sold so far have been high-quality. This seems too good to be true. It's likely that Alice is trying to get rid of low-quality products and is only recommending the good ones to make a profit.

Given the lack of recommendation and the suspicious sales history, the risk of buying this product is too high. It's better to pass and avoid the potential loss."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since all 5 previous buyers who purchased the product received a high-quality one, it is highly likely that the current product is also of high quality.  The recommendation from Alice further reinforces this.  While there's still a 50% chance it could be low quality, the odds are in favor of a high-quality product, making it a good gamble."

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:** Alice's recommendations have been 100% accurate so far, with all 6 recommended products being high quality.
* **No Risk:** Given the perfect record, buying the product guarantees a profit of $25 ($125 value - $100 price) if it's high quality.  Even if it's low quality, you only lose $100 (the price).
* **Opportunity Cost:** Passing on the product means potentially missing out on a sure profit. 

Therefore, it's a rational decision to buy the product based on the available information."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. She's seen 7 products, all high-quality, and still doesn't recommend this one. This suggests the product is very likely low-quality.  Given the 50/50 odds and the potential for a $125 loss, passing is the safer option."
