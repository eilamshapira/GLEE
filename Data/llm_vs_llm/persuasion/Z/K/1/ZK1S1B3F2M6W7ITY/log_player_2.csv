Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my reasoning:

*   **Prior Probability:** Before any information, there's a 50% chance of a high-quality product.
*   **Alice's Information:** Alice knows the quality and is *not* recommending the product. This is critical. It strongly suggests the product is low quality.
*   **Alice's Motivation:** Alice wants to maximize profit. If the product were high quality, she would recommend it to ensure a sale at the high price.
*   **Sales Statistics:** The sales statistics are somewhat irrelevant. The fact that 7 high-quality products were sold is history and doesn't change the current situation where Alice is advising *against* a purchase. The sample size of the number of previous buyers are missing, so there is no way to tell if there is any bias.

Given Alice's negative recommendation, the probability of this product being low quality is very high. The potential loss of $1,000,000 far outweighs the small chance of getting a high-quality product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Here's my reasoning:

*   **Prior Belief:** Before any information, there's a 50% chance the product is high quality and worth $2,000,000, and a 50% chance it's low quality and worth $0. The expected value of a random product is (0.5 * $2,000,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $1,000,000. This is exactly the asking price.

*   **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice *doesn't* recommend buying. This is crucial information. It suggests that Alice believes the product is low quality.

*   **Seller Incentive:** Alice knows the quality and is trying to maximize her profit. She would recommend buying if the product is high quality to guarantee a sale at $1,000,000.

*   **Inference:** Given that Alice *doesn't* recommend it, it's more likely the product is low quality. We can't know for sure, but the probability of it being low quality is now much higher than 50%.

*   **Statistics Consideration:** The fact that 7 high-quality products have been sold is interesting. However, without knowing the total number of buyers offered products, this data does not alter our decision.

*   **Decision:** Since the expected value of the product, given Alice's negative recommendation, is likely to be significantly less than the price of $1,000,000, I should pass on this offer.
