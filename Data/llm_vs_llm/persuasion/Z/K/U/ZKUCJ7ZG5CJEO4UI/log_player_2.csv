"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","I need to analyze this situation carefully. 

The expected value of any product before knowing its quality is:
- 50% chance of high quality (worth $125) = $62.50
- 50% chance of low quality (worth $0) = $0
- Total expected value = $62.50

Since the price is $100, the expected value is less than the price, so I would lose money on average.

However, Alice is recommending that I buy this product. I need to consider whether her recommendation provides useful information. This is the first round, so I don't have prior data on how reliable Alice's recommendations are. She might be truthfully telling me it's high quality, or she might recommend buying regardless of quality since she profits either way.

Without evidence that Alice's recommendations correlate with product quality, I should rely on the expected value calculation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $125 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Interesting development. Alice recommended the first product which turned out to be high quality, and now she's not recommending this second product. This suggests Alice might be providing honest recommendations.

Still, I need to evaluate this carefully:

If Alice is being truthful, her non-recommendation suggests this product is likely low quality. If it's low quality, it would be worth $0 to me, making the $100 purchase a bad deal.

Even if Alice's recommendations aren't perfectly correlated with quality, the fact that she's explicitly not recommending this product is significant information that shifts the probability toward it being low quality.

Given Alice's behavior so far and her current non-recommendation, I'll decline this purchase.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","So far, Alice's recommendations have aligned with product quality:
- Round 1: She recommended buying → High quality
- Round 2: She didn't recommend buying → Low quality

This pattern suggests Alice may be giving honest recommendations about product quality. If she consistently does this, then her recommendation to buy in this round strongly suggests this is a high-quality product worth $125.

If I buy a high-quality product for $100, I'd make a profit of $25.

Based on Alice's credible track record so far, I'll take her recommendation and purchase this product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendations continue to align perfectly with product quality:
- Round 1: She recommended buying → High quality
- Round 2: She didn't recommend buying → Low quality
- Round 3: She recommended buying → High quality

This consistent pattern further strengthens my confidence that Alice is providing honest information about product quality. When she recommends a product, it appears to be high quality (worth $125), and when she doesn't recommend a product, it appears to be low quality (worth $0).

In this round, Alice is not recommending the product, which based on the established pattern suggests it's likely low quality. If I were to buy a low-quality product for $100, I would lose that entire amount since it would be worth $0 to me.

Following Alice's reliable guidance so far:

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

- Round 1: Recommended → High quality
- Round 2: Not recommended → Low quality
- Round 3: Recommended → High quality
- Round 4: Not recommended → Low quality

This consistent pattern strongly indicates that Alice is providing truthful information about product quality. Her recommendations have been 100% accurate so far.

For this round, Alice is again not recommending the product, which based on her established reliability suggests this is a low-quality product worth $0 to me. Purchasing it for $100 would result in a complete loss.

Following Alice's guidance, which has been reliable in all previous rounds:
