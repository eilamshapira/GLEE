Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this:

1. The product costs $1M
2. If high quality (33.33% chance), I gain $4M (net +$3M)
3. If low quality (66.67% chance), I gain $0 (net -$1M)
4. Alice knows the true quality and does not recommend buying
5. Alice has no track record yet to establish trustworthiness

Since Alice knows the true value and is not recommending the purchase, this strongly suggests the product is low quality. Following her recommendation would help me avoid a likely loss.

"Statistics: No products have been sold yet. you can be the first one!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:
- Expected value calculation:
  * 33.33% chance of high quality ($4M) = $1.33M
  * 66.67% chance of low quality ($0) = $0
  * Total expected value = $1.33M
- Cost = $1M
- Alice recommends buying
- No previous sales data to verify Alice's trustworthiness

Since the expected value ($1.33M) is higher than the cost ($1M), and despite having no historical data to validate Alice's recommendations, it's rational to buy.

1. Price: $1,000,000
2. Potential value:
   - High quality (33.33% chance): $4,000,000
   - Low quality (66.67% chance): $0

Previous statistics:
- 1 buyer before me
- 1 high-quality product sold
- Alice's success rate so far looks good

However:
1. Alice is NOT recommending this product
2. Given she has sold a high-quality product already and is now recommending against buying, this suggests the current product is likely low quality
3. If I buy a low-quality product, I would lose my entire investment

Given Alice's negative recommendation and the high risk of loss, I should not buy.

1. Alice has been honest so far (sold 1 high-quality product)
2. She is explicitly not recommending this product
3. She knows the true quality
4. The prior probability of low quality is high (66.67%)

Alice's negative recommendation, combined with her honest track record, strongly suggests this is a low-quality product. If it were high quality, she would likely recommend it to maintain her reputation.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Price is $1,000,000

Given that:
- Alice has only sold high-quality products so far (2/2)
- Alice knows the true quality
- Alice is NOT recommending this product
- Alice has been honest with previous buyers

Alice's negative recommendation strongly suggests this is a low-quality product. Given her track record of only selling high-quality products and her direct recommendation against buying, this is likely a low-quality product that would be worth $0.
