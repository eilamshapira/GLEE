"Round 1

Round 3

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no""}

Let's think through this. We have 17 rounds left, and so far, I've spent $200 and gotten $0 in value. The expected value of each product to me is 0.333*120 + 0.667*0 = $40, which is less than the $100 cost."

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes""}

I changed my mind because the expected value calculation doesn't change the past. With 16 rounds to go, if I continue to pass, I will not be able to take advantage of the potential value. The expected value of each product is still $40, but if I pass every time, I will definitely get $0, so I might as well try to maximize my potential value."
