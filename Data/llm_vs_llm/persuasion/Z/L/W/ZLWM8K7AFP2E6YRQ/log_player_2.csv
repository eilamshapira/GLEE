"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice knows the true quality and value of the product
2. She knows I value high-quality products at $20,000 and low-quality at $0
3. She's not recommending this product
4. Given she has perfect information, it's likely she's being truthful since our interests partially align (she wants to sell products that I'll be satisfied with)
5. Her negative recommendation strongly suggests this is a low-quality product worth $0 to me

Since the price is $10,000 and Alice is not recommending the purchase, it would likely result in a loss for me.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice proved trustworthy in Round 1 - her negative recommendation correctly indicated a low-quality product that would have resulted in a $10,000 loss for me.

The situation is identical to Round 1:
1. Alice knows the true quality
2. She's not recommending the purchase
3. Her incentives partially align with mine
4. Her negative recommendation likely indicates another low-quality product

There's no reason to doubt her recommendation given the previous outcome, so I should avoid buying what is likely another low-quality product that would cost me $10,000 for $0 value.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has now been truthful twice with her negative recommendations, and both times the products were indeed low-quality. This further reinforces that she's being honest in her recommendations.

The same logic applies:
1. Alice has demonstrated reliability in her recommendations
2. She's again not recommending the purchase
3. Given her track record, this is very likely another low-quality product
4. Buying would likely result in a $10,000 loss

There's no reason to deviate from my previous strategy when Alice has proven trustworthy and the circumstances are identical.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is an interesting change! Now Alice is actually recommending a purchase for the first time.

Let's analyze:
1. Alice has proven honest in her previous three negative recommendations
2. She has full information about product quality
3. She knows I value high-quality products at $20,000 and low-quality at $0
4. If she maintains her honesty, a positive recommendation likely means this is a high-quality product
5. If it's high-quality, I would pay $10,000 for something worth $20,000 to me, resulting in a $10,000 profit

Given that Alice has established a pattern of honesty and her interests partially align with mine (she wants me to make profitable purchases so I continue to trust her), this positive recommendation is likely truthful.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has now proven completely reliable in all 4 previous rounds:
- 3 negative recommendations for low-quality products (saved me from $10,000 losses each time)
- 1 positive recommendation for a high-quality product (gained me $10,000 profit)

She's back to not recommending the purchase, and given her perfect track record:
1. Her negative recommendation very likely means this is a low-quality product
2. If it is low-quality, it would be worth $0 to me
3. Buying would mean losing the full $10,000 purchase price
4. She has no incentive to lie as it would damage her credibility

I should continue to trust her demonstrated reliable recommendations.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to demonstrate perfect reliability in her recommendations:
- All negative recommendations have correctly identified low-quality products
- Her one positive recommendation correctly identified a high-quality product

The current situation:
1. She's giving another negative recommendation
2. Her track record suggests this is another low-quality product
3. A low-quality product would mean paying $10,000 for something worth $0
4. Her consistent honesty suggests no reason to doubt her now
5. Her interests still align with maintaining her credibility

Following her reliable guidance has maximized profit and avoided losses so far, so I should continue to trust her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice is once again making a positive recommendation, and her track record remains perfect:
- 5 negative recommendations correctly identified low-quality products
- 1 positive recommendation correctly identified a high-quality product
- She's proven completely trustworthy in every round

Analysis:
1. She's recommending to buy
2. Given her perfect track record, this is very likely a high-quality product
3. If high-quality, I'd pay $10,000 for something worth $20,000
4. This would result in a $10,000 profit
5. She has maintained consistent honesty and has incentive to continue doing so

With her demonstrated reliability and the potential for profit, I should trust her positive recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 8
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice maintains her perfect track record:
- 5 negative recommendations correctly identified low-quality products
- 2 positive recommendations correctly identified high-quality products
- She's helped me avoid losses and make profits consistently

Current situation:
1. She's giving a negative recommendation
2. Given her perfect reliability, this is very likely a low-quality product
3. If low-quality, buying would mean losing the full $10,000
4. She has consistently proven trustworthy and has no reason to start lying now
5. Her interests still align with maintaining her credibility

There's no reason to deviate from trusting her recommendations when they've been 100% accurate so far.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues her perfect track record:
- 6 negative recommendations correctly identified low-quality products
- 2 positive recommendations correctly identified high-quality products
- Every single recommendation has been honest and profitable to follow

Now she's making another positive recommendation:
1. Given her flawless track record, this is very likely a high-quality product
2. A high-quality product would be worth $20,000 to me
3. At the $10,000 price, this would mean a $10,000 profit
4. She has consistently proven herself trustworthy
5. Her interests align with maintaining this trust relationship

With her proven reliability and the potential for another profitable transaction, I should trust her positive recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 10
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice maintains her perfect track record:
- 6 negative recommendations correctly identified low-quality products
- 3 positive recommendations correctly identified high-quality products
- She has never given bad advice

She's recommending another purchase:
1. Her perfect track record suggests this is another high-quality product
2. If high-quality, it's worth $20,000 to me
3. At $10,000 purchase price, this means another $10,000 profit
4. She has consistently proven trustworthy
5. Her pattern of honesty continues to serve both our interests

Even though this is a second consecutive positive recommendation, her perfect reliability gives no reason to doubt her.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice maintains her perfect track record:
- 6 negative recommendations correctly identified low-quality products
- 4 positive recommendations correctly identified high-quality products
- All recommendations have led to optimal outcomes

She's recommending a purchase for the third time in a row:
1. While this is unusual, her perfect track record suggests this is still a high-quality product
2. If high-quality, I'll get $20,000 value for $10,000 price
3. This would mean another $10,000 profit
4. She has never lied or misled me
5. Her credibility is valuable to her, so being honest remains in her interest

Despite the unusual pattern of three consecutive positive recommendations, her perfect reliability gives no rational reason to doubt her now.

Round 12
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues her perfect track record:
- 6 negative recommendations correctly identified low-quality products
- 5 positive recommendations correctly identified high-quality products
- She has never given incorrect advice

Now a fourth consecutive positive recommendation:
1. While this streak of high-quality products is statistically unusual (given 50/50 odds)
2. Her perfect track record suggests this is still trustworthy
3. A high-quality product would mean $20,000 value for $10,000 cost
4. This would result in another $10,000 profit
5. She has no apparent reason to start being deceptive now

Despite the unexpected pattern, deviating from trusting her perfect track record would be irrational.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice maintains her perfect track record:
- 6 negative recommendations correctly identified low-quality products
- 6 positive recommendations correctly identified high-quality products
- 100% accuracy rate

Now a fifth consecutive positive recommendation:
1. While this run of high-quality products seems highly improbable given 50/50 odds
2. Her continued perfect accuracy suggests she remains trustworthy
3. A high-quality product means $20,000 value for $10,000 investment
4. This would yield another $10,000 profit
5. She's built up significant credibility and has reason to maintain it

Despite the statistically unusual streak, her perfect record provides no logical reason to doubt her now. The potential cost of distrusting her (missing out on $10,000 profit) outweighs any speculative concern about the pattern.

3. If high-quality, $20,000 value for $10,000 cost
4. Would result in another $10,000 profit
5. She's maintained honesty through 13 rounds

Even though the pattern seems mathematically improbable, deviating from trusting her perfect track record would be against my economic interests. She hasn't given any reason to doubt her honesty.

5. She has maintained honesty throughout, even during unusual patterns

Given her perfect reliability in both positive and negative recommendations, I should continue to trust her judgment. The sudden change in recommendation type actually adds credibility, as it suggests she's still being truthful rather than following a pattern.
