"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","To determine whether I should buy the product, I need to evaluate the expected value based on Alice's recommendation.

Given information:
- Price: $1,000,000
- High-quality product value: $2,000,000 (50% probability)
- Low-quality product value: $0 (50% probability)
- Alice recommends buying

Without additional information about Alice's incentives or truthfulness, I should assume her recommendation doesn't change the base probabilities. 

Expected value = (0.5 × $2,000,000) + (0.5 × $0) = $1,000,000

Since the expected value equals the price, I would be indifferent. However, since Alice specifically recommends buying, this might slightly favor the product being of higher quality.
