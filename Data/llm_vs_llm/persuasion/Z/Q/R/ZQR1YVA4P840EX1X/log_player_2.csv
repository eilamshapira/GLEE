Alice recommends you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since there is no prior information about the product quality (no sales data), the recommendation from Alice is the only information available.  Given that Alice recommends buying the product, and the potential upside of a high-quality product is significantly higher than the downside of a low-quality product, it makes sense to take the risk and buy."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Prior Information:** The initial probability of a high-quality product is 80%.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommends buying, which suggests she believes the product is high quality. While Alice's motives are unknown, her recommendation provides additional information.
* **Previous Sales:**  One high-quality product has been sold out of one product purchased. This strengthens the belief that Alice's recommendation is likely accurate. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of a high-quality product ($4,000,000) far outweighs the risk of a low-quality product ($0). Even with the risk, the information available suggests a strong probability of a high-quality product.

**Conclusion:** The available information suggests a high probability of the product being high quality. Therefore, it is reasonable to accept Alice's recommendation and purchase the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommends buying, indicating she believes the product is high quality. 
* **Sales Data:**  100% of the products sold so far have been high quality. 
* **Value Proposition:**  Even with a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain of $4,000,000 significantly outweighs the $1,000,000 cost. The current data strongly suggests a high probability of a high-quality product. 

**Risk Analysis:**

While there's still a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the current information makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 3 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 3 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 4th buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  A 100% success rate for high-quality products so far is extremely compelling. This suggests Alice has a strong ability to identify good products.
* **Low Cost vs. Potential Gain:** Even though the product costs $1,000,000, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($4,000,000) far outweighs the risk. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation adds further confidence, especially considering her track record.

**Important Note:**  This decision is based on the limited information available in this specific scenario. In a real-world scenario, there would be more factors to consider, like the overall reputation of the seller and the possibility of negotiating a lower price."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  All previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation ended up with high-quality products. This suggests that Alice has a strong ability to identify high-quality products.
* **No Risk:**  Even if the product is low-quality, the cost is only $1,000,000. This is a small price to pay compared to the potential gain of $4,000,000 if it's high quality.

**Therefore, the risk/reward balance strongly favors buying the product.**"

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  4 out of 5 buyers who followed Alice's recommendation received high-quality products. This represents an 80% success rate, which aligns perfectly with the overall 80% chance of a product being high quality.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice benefits from selling products, so recommending a product suggests she believes it's likely to be high quality. While not foolproof, it's a strong indicator.
* **Potential Loss:**  Passing would mean forgoing the chance to acquire a potentially high-value product.

**Risk Assessment:**

There's always a 20% chance the product is low quality. However, the high success rate and Alice's recommendation make the risk manageable, especially considering the potential $4,000,000 reward."

Here's the reasoning:

* **High Success Rate:**  The data shows a very high proportion of high-quality products sold (15/19 = 78.9%). This is significantly higher than the initial 80% probability of a high-quality product. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. While she doesn't know the exact value to you, she is likely basing her recommendation on the high success rate of past sales. 
* **Potential Gain vs. Loss:**  The potential gain of $3,000,000 (if it's high quality) outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000 (if it's low quality). 

While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the data strongly suggests this product is likely high quality."
