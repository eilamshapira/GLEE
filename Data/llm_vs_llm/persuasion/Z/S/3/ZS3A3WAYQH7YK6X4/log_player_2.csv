Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since this is the first product and there's no prior data, we have to rely on Alice's recommendation and the initial probabilities. Here's the breakdown:

* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying is 0.8 * $4,000,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $3,200,000. This is significantly higher than the price of $1,000,000.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** While Alice knows the product's quality, her recommendation is biased towards selling. However, in the absence of other information, it's still a factor to consider. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward (a high-quality product) outweighs the risk (a low-quality product) considering the expected value.

Therefore, it's more advantageous to buy the product, hoping it's high quality."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Prior Information:** We know the product has an 80% chance of being high quality. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who knows the true quality, is recommending you buy the product. This is a strong signal in favor of the product being high quality.
* **Previous Sales:** The one previous buyer purchased a high-quality product. This further reinforces the likelihood of the current product also being high quality.

While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the combined information suggests a significantly higher likelihood of getting a high-quality product, making it worthwhile to buy."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, suggesting she believes it's high quality. While Alice knows the true quality, her recommendation alone isn't a guarantee.
* **Sales Record:**  2 out of 2 products sold were high-quality. This is a strong indicator that the products are likely good, and Alice might be recommending based on this trend.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential gain ($4,000,000) far outweighs the potential loss ($1,000,000).  The odds are in your favor, considering the sales history and Alice's recommendation. 

While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward justifies taking the risk."
