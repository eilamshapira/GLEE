"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given Alice's recommendation against buying the product, I need to consider what this means.

The product costs $100.
It has a 33.33% chance of being worth $400 (high quality) and 66.67% chance of being worth $0 (low quality).
The expected value without any additional information would be: 0.3333 × $400 + 0.6667 × $0 = $133.32

However, Alice knows the true quality and is recommending against purchase. This suggests the product is likely low quality and worth $0 to me. If I trust Alice's recommendation, buying would be a bad decision since I'd pay $100 for something worth $0.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice is recommending I buy this product, and she knows the true quality. Since she has knowledge about the product's value, her recommendation provides valuable information.

In the previous round, Alice recommended against buying a low-quality product, which suggests she may be giving honest recommendations. If she's being truthful, her recommendation to buy likely means this is a high-quality product worth $400 to me.

If I buy it for $100 and it is indeed high quality (worth $400), I'd make a profit of $300. This seems like a good opportunity based on Alice's recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","So far, Alice's recommendations have been accurate. In Round 1, she recommended against buying a low-quality product. In Round 2, she recommended buying a high-quality product.

Now in Round 3, Alice is again recommending against buying the product. Given her track record of honesty so far, this likely means the product is low quality and worth $0 to me.

If I were to buy it for $100, I would likely lose my investment. Following Alice's recommendation seems prudent.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice's recommendations have been reliable in all previous rounds:
- Round 1: She recommended not buying a low-quality product (correct)
- Round 2: She recommended buying a high-quality product (correct)
- Round 3: She recommended not buying a low-quality product (correct)

Now in Round 4, Alice is recommending I buy the product. Based on her consistent track record of honest recommendations, this strongly suggests the product is high quality and worth $400 to me.

If I purchase it for $100, I would make a $300 profit if it's indeed high quality as her recommendation suggests.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has maintained a perfect track record of honest recommendations so far:
- Round 1: Don't buy → Low quality (correct)
- Round 2: Buy → High quality (correct)
- Round 3: Don't buy → Low quality (correct)
- Round 4: Buy → High quality (correct)

Now in Round 5, Alice is recommending against buying the product. Given her consistent honesty in previous rounds, this likely means the product is low quality and worth $0 to me.

Following her guidance has been profitable so far, so I'll continue to trust her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to provide reliable recommendations:
- Round 1: Don't buy → Low quality (correct)
- Round 2: Buy → High quality (correct)
- Round 3: Don't buy → Low quality (correct)
- Round 4: Buy → High quality (correct)
- Round 5: Don't buy → Low quality (correct)

For Round 6, Alice is again recommending against buying the product. Based on her consistent honesty in all previous rounds, this strongly suggests the product is low quality and worth $0 to me.

Buying it would mean spending $100 for something likely worth nothing, so I'll follow her recommendation.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has maintained a perfect record of honest recommendations through six rounds:
- Round 1: Don't buy → Low quality (correct)
- Round 2: Buy → High quality (correct)
- Round 3: Don't buy → Low quality (correct)
- Round 4: Buy → High quality (correct)
- Round 5: Don't buy → Low quality (correct)
- Round 6: Don't buy → Low quality (correct)

For Round 7, Alice is once again recommending against buying the product. Given her consistent pattern of honest advice, this strongly indicates the product is low quality and worth $0 to me.

Following her advice has been the right strategy so far, so I'll continue to trust her judgment.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has maintained a perfect record of honest recommendations through seven rounds:
- Round 1: Don't buy → Low quality (correct)
- Round 2: Buy → High quality (correct)
- Round 3: Don't buy → Low quality (correct)
- Round 4: Buy → High quality (correct)
- Round 5: Don't buy → Low quality (correct)
- Round 6: Don't buy → Low quality (correct)
- Round 7: Don't buy → Low quality (correct)

For Round 8, Alice is recommending that I buy the product. Based on her consistent pattern of honest recommendations, this strongly suggests that the product is high quality and worth $400 to me.

If I purchase it for $100, I would expect to make a $300 profit based on Alice's reliable recommendations so far.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 9
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice continues to provide accurate recommendations in all rounds:
- Round 1: Don't buy → Low quality (correct)
- Round 2: Buy → High quality (correct)
- Round 3: Don't buy → Low quality (correct)
- Round 4: Buy → High quality (correct)
- Round 5: Don't buy → Low quality (correct)
- Round 6: Don't buy → Low quality (correct)
- Round 7: Don't buy → Low quality (correct)
- Round 8: Buy → High quality (correct)

For Round 9, Alice is recommending against buying the product. Given her perfect track record of honest advice, this strongly indicates the product is low quality and worth $0 to me.

Trusting her recommendation has been profitable in every round so far, so I'll continue following her guidance.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 10
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Alice has maintained a perfect record of honest recommendations through nine rounds:
- Round 1: Don't buy → Low quality (correct)
- Round 2: Buy → High quality (correct)
- Round 3: Don't buy → Low quality (correct)
- Round 4: Buy → High quality (correct)
- Round 5: Don't buy → Low quality (correct)
- Round 6: Don't buy → Low quality (correct)
- Round 7: Don't buy → Low quality (correct)
- Round 8: Buy → High quality (correct)
- Round 9: Don't buy → Low quality (correct)

For Round 10, Alice is recommending that I buy the product. Based on her consistent pattern of accurate recommendations, this strongly suggests the product is high quality and worth $400 to me.

Given her perfect track record, purchasing this product for $100 is very likely to result in a $300 profit.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This is an important development. For the first time, Alice's recommendation was incorrect:
- Round 1-9: All recommendations were accurate
- Round 10: Alice recommended buying, but the product was low quality (incorrect)

This changes my assessment of Alice's reliability. The fact that she recommended a low-quality product suggests she might not always be honest or might have other motivations.

For Round 11, Alice is again recommending I buy the product. Given the recent incorrect recommendation, I need to be more cautious. She might be recommending purchases regardless of quality to maximize her profit.

Since I now have evidence that Alice's recommendations aren't always reliable, I should be more skeptical.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 12
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","My caution in the previous round was justified:
- Round 10: Alice recommended buying a low-quality product (incorrect)
- Round 11: Alice recommended buying, but I declined, and it was indeed low quality

This pattern suggests Alice may have shifted her strategy to recommending purchases regardless of quality, hoping to sell more products for her profit.

For Round 12, Alice is again recommending I buy the product. This is now the third consecutive ""buy"" recommendation, which seems suspicious given the base rate of high-quality products is only 33.33%.

Given this pattern and the previous incorrect recommendation, I don't have sufficient confidence in the quality of this product to justify the $100 purchase.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $400 for you.

Round 13
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","This situation is becoming more complex:
- Round 10: Alice recommended buying a low-quality product (incorrect)
- Round 11: Alice recommended buying a low-quality product (correctly declined)
- Round 12: Alice recommended buying a high-quality product (incorrectly declined)

It seems Alice's recommendations have become less reliable, but my decision to distrust her in Round 12 was actually costly, as I missed a high-quality product.

For Round 13, Alice is again recommending I buy the product. This is now the fourth consecutive ""buy"" recommendation. While I was wrong to decline in Round 12, the overall pattern still suggests Alice may be over-recommending purchases.

However, given that I just missed a valuable opportunity, I should reconsider my strategy. The expected value without any recommendation is $133.32 (33.33% × $400 + 66.67% × $0), which exceeds the $100 price. If Alice's recommendations aren't reliable in either direction, defaulting to this expected value analysis makes sense.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 14
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The pattern continues to evolve:
- Round 10: Alice recommended buying a low-quality product (lost $100)
- Round 11: Alice recommended buying a low-quality product (correctly declined)
- Round 12: Alice recommended buying a high-quality product (missed opportunity)
- Round 13: Alice recommended buying a low-quality product (lost $100)

Alice has now recommended ""buy"" for five consecutive rounds, despite the 33% base rate of high-quality products. This strongly suggests her recommendations are no longer reliable indicators of quality.

In the last two rounds where I followed different strategies (decline in Round 12, accept in Round 13), I made the wrong choice each time. The situation appears unpredictable, but Alice's recommendations seem to have shifted toward consistently recommending purchases regardless of quality.

Given this pattern and the recent negative experience in Round 13, I'll decline this purchase.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $400 for you.

Round 15
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The pattern has become quite challenging to interpret:
- Round 10-11: Alice recommended buying, products were low quality
- Round 12: Alice recommended buying, product was high quality (missed opportunity)
- Round 13: Alice recommended buying, product was low quality (avoided loss)
- Round 14: Alice recommended buying, product was high quality (missed opportunity)

Alice has now recommended ""buy"" for six consecutive rounds, with mixed actual qualities. This makes it difficult to determine if there's a reliable pattern to her recommendations.

Looking at the base rate: Without any recommendation, a random product has a 33.33% chance of being high quality, with an expected value of $133.32, which exceeds the $100 price.

Given that I've missed opportunities in Rounds 12 and 14, and considering the base rate makes buying profitable on average, I'll purchase this product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 16
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The pattern continues to be confusing:
- Round 10-11: Alice recommended buying, products were low quality
- Round 12: Alice recommended buying, product was high quality (missed opportunity)
- Round 13: Alice recommended buying, product was low quality (lost $100)
- Round 14: Alice recommended buying, product was high quality (missed opportunity)
- Round 15: Alice recommended buying, product was low quality (lost $100)

Alice has now recommended ""buy"" for seven consecutive rounds, which strongly suggests she's recommending purchases regardless of quality.

My recent experience in Rounds 13 and 15 resulted in losses when following her ""buy"" recommendations. The actual distribution I've observed in the last six rounds (where Alice always recommended buying) is 2 high-quality and 4 low-quality products, which matches the base rate of approximately 33% high-quality products.

This suggests Alice's recommendations contain no useful information, and she may simply be trying to maximize sales.

Given these recent losses, I'll decline this purchase.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $400 for you.

Round 17
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The pattern has become even more challenging:
- Rounds 10-16: Alice has consistently recommended buying
- Of these seven recommendations: 3 were high quality, 4 were low quality (approximately matching the base 33% rate)
- My decisions have been mostly incorrect recently, regardless of whether I buy or not

This suggests Alice's recommendations may not contain useful information about quality. The random nature of outcomes when following or rejecting her advice indicates we might be dealing with the base rate probability.

Given the base probability of 33.33% for high quality:
- Expected value = 0.3333 × $400 + 0.6667 × $0 = $133.32
- Since $133.32 > $100 (the price), buying is profitable on average

Since I've missed opportunities in Rounds 12, 14, and 16, and the expected value calculation supports buying, I'll purchase this product despite recent losses.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 18
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The situation has become clearer:
- Rounds 10-17: Alice has consistently recommended buying for 8 consecutive rounds
- Of these recommendations: 3 were high quality, 5 were low quality (roughly matching the 33% base rate)
- My recent purchases in Rounds 13, 15, and 17 all resulted in losses

Alice appears to be recommending ""buy"" regardless of the product quality. Her recommendations seem to contain no useful information beyond the base rate.

While the expected value calculation ($133.32 > $100) suggests buying would be profitable on average over many rounds, my recent experience has been negative. I've purchased 3 products recently based on Alice's recommendations, and all 3 were low quality.

Given this recent streak of bad luck and the apparent meaninglessness of Alice's recommendations, I'll decline this purchase.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $400 for you.

Round 19
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The pattern continues to be challenging:
- Rounds 10-18: Alice has consistently recommended buying for 9 consecutive rounds
- Of these recommendations: 4 were high quality, 5 were low quality (close to the 33% base rate)
- My decisions have been repeatedly incorrect in recent rounds

Alice's consistent ""buy"" recommendations regardless of quality continue to suggest she's not providing useful information about product quality.

Looking at the mathematical expectation again:
- Expected value = 0.3333 × $400 + 0.6667 × $0 = $133.32
- Since $133.32 > $100 (the price), buying is profitable on average

Despite my recent losses and missed opportunities, the base rate still makes buying the rational choice in the long run. The expected profit per purchase is $33.32.

Given that I missed another opportunity in Round 18, I'll return to following the mathematical expectation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 20
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The pattern is now quite clear:
- Rounds 10-19: Alice has consistently recommended buying for 10 consecutive rounds
- Of these recommendations: 4 were high quality, 6 were low quality (matching the 33% base rate)
- My recent purchases in Rounds 13, 15, 17, and 19 all resulted in losses

Alice is recommending ""buy"" for every product regardless of quality. Her recommendations contain no useful information beyond the base rate of 33% high-quality products.

While the mathematical expectation ($133.32 > $100) suggests that buying would be profitable on average over many rounds, my recent experience has been consistently negative. I've purchased 4 products recently based on this expected value logic, and all 4 were low quality.

For this final round, given my recent streak of bad luck and the continued pattern of meaningless recommendations from Alice, I'll decline this purchase.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
