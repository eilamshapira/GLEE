Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this decision:

1) The product has an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $3,000,000) and 20% chance of being low quality (worth $0)
2) The price is fixed at $1,000,000
3) Alice recommends I buy the product
4) There's no sales history yet to evaluate Alice's recommendation patterns

Expected value calculation:
- 80% chance of $3,000,000 value = $2,400,000
- 20% chance of $0 value = $0
- Total expected value = $2,400,000

Since the expected value ($2,400,000) exceeds the price ($1,000,000), it's rational to buy the product even without considering Alice's recommendation.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Given the information provided, I'll analyze whether it's rational to purchase the product:

- The product costs $1,000,000
- A high-quality product is worth $3,000,000 to me
- A low-quality product is worth $0 to me
- The prior probability is 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice has recommended that I buy the product
- Alice's previous sale was a high-quality product

Since Alice is recommending I buy, and her previous recommendation resulted in a high-quality product sale, there's evidence her recommendations may be reliable. The expected value calculation favors purchasing:

Expected value = (0.8 × $3,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) - $1,000,000 = $2,400,000 - $1,000,000 = $1,400,000

With a positive expected value and Alice's recommendation, I'll purchase the product.

Given information:
- The product costs $1,000,000
- High-quality product (80% chance) is worth $3,000,000 to me
- Low-quality product (20% chance) is worth $0 to me
- Alice has sold to 2 previous buyers, and both received high-quality products
- Alice recommends that I buy the product

The expected value calculation:
- If I buy: 0.8 × $3,000,000 + 0.2 × $0 - $1,000,000 = $2,400,000 - $1,000,000 = $1,400,000
- If I don't buy: $0

The fact that Alice has only sold high-quality products so far and is recommending this product to me is a positive signal. The expected value of buying is significantly positive.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this decision:

1) The product costs $1,000,000
2) If high quality, it's worth $3,000,000 to me (profit: $2,000,000)
3) If low quality, it's worth $0 to me (loss: $1,000,000)
4) Base probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
5) Alice has sold 3 products so far, all high quality
6) Alice is recommending I buy this product

Alice's perfect track record (3/3 high quality products) and her recommendation to buy are positive signals. The expected value calculation also favors buying:
- 80% chance of $2,000,000 profit = $1,600,000
- 20% chance of $1,000,000 loss = -$200,000
- Net expected value: $1,400,000

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this scenario:

Alice recommends buying the product. So far, 4 buyers have purchased based on her recommendations, and all 4 products sold were high quality.

The product costs $1,000,000.
- If it's high quality (80% chance), I gain $3,000,000, for a net profit of $2,000,000
- If it's low quality (20% chance), I gain $0, for a net loss of $1,000,000

The expected value calculation:
(0.8 × $2,000,000) + (0.2 × -$1,000,000) = $1,600,000 - $200,000 = $1,400,000

Since the expected value is clearly positive, and Alice's recommendations have been accurate so far (all sold products were high quality), this is a good deal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this situation:

- Products have an 80% chance of being high quality (worth $3,000,000) and 20% chance of being low quality (worth $0)
- Price is fixed at $1,000,000
- Alice knows product quality and provides recommendations
- So far, 5 buyers have purchased based on Alice's recommendations
- All 5 products sold have been high quality
- Alice is recommending I buy the current product

The expected value of a random product would be:
(80% × $3,000,000) + (20% × $0) = $2,400,000

Since this exceeds the $1,000,000 price, the product has positive expected value.

Additionally, Alice's perfect track record of 5/5 high-quality products sold suggests her recommendations are reliable. Given that she's recommending I buy, and all her previous recommendations led to high-quality sales, this further increases my confidence.

- Value if low quality: $0 (loss of $1,000,000)
- Prior probability: 80% high quality, 20% low quality
- Alice's track record: 6 out of 6 previous buyers received high-quality products
- Alice recommends buying this product

Alice has a perfect track record so far, and she's recommending this product. Given her knowledge of product quality and the strong historical performance, her recommendation likely indicates this is a high-quality product.

The expected value calculation supports buying:
0.8 × $2,000,000 - 0.2 × $1,000,000 = $1,600,000 - $200,000 = $1,400,000 positive expected value

Alice's recommendation and perfect track record further strengthen the case for buying.

Given information:
- Each product has an 80% chance of being high quality, 20% chance of low quality
- High-quality product is worth $3M to me, low quality is worth $0
- Price is $1M
- 7 previous buyers purchased based on Alice's recommendations
- 7 high-quality products have been sold (100% high quality so far)
- Alice recommends I buy the product

This means Alice has been truthful in her recommendations so far. The expected value of purchasing is:
- If I trust Alice's recommendation: $3M (100% chance of high quality based on past performance)
- Cost: $1M
- Expected profit: $3M - $1M = $2M

Even if I just consider the base probability (80% high quality), the expected value would be:
(0.8 × $3M) - $1M = $1.4M

Since Alice recommends buying and has a perfect track record, purchasing is the rational choice.

Alice recommends that I buy the product, and based on the statistics, 8 buyers have purchased products so far, and all 8 were high-quality products. This suggests Alice's recommendations have been reliable.

- Product price: $1,000,000
- High-quality product value: $3,000,000 (80% chance)
- Low-quality product value: $0 (20% chance)
- Expected value without additional info: (0.8 × $3,000,000) + (0.2 × $0) - $1,000,000 = $1,400,000

- High-quality product value: $3,000,000
- Low-quality product value: $0
- Overall probability: 80% high-quality, 20% low-quality

Alice has been mostly accurate in her recommendations, with only 1 out of 11 being a low-quality product. This is better than the baseline 80% probability of getting a high-quality product.

If I buy:
- 10/11 chance (≈91%) of getting $3,000,000 value for $1,000,000 (net gain of $2,000,000)
- 1/11 chance (≈9%) of getting $0 value for $1,000,000 (net loss of $1,000,000)

Expected value: 0.91 × $2,000,000 - 0.09 × $1,000,000 = $1,820,000 - $90,000 = $1,730,000
