Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice knows the true quality of the product and recommends buying it. This suggests the product is likely high quality.
* **No prior sales data:**  There's no information about past sales to base a decision on. 
* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying the product is: 
    * (0.8 * $12,500) + (0.2 * $0) = $10,000
    * This is equal to the price, meaning there's no expected loss.

Since the expected value is positive and Alice's recommendation suggests a high-quality product, it makes sense to buy."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice, knowing the product's true quality, recommends buying it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality.
* **Limited Data:** With only one previous sale, the data is insufficient to make a reliable judgment based on the sales record alone. 
* **Expected Value:**  Even with a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain of $12,500 from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $10,000. 

Given the limited information and Alice's recommendation, taking the risk and buying the product is the more rational decision."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While there's always risk, the available information points towards buying:

* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice knows the true quality and is recommending the product. This suggests it's likely high-quality.
* **Past sales:** All products sold so far have been high-quality. This is a small sample size, but it's a positive indicator.

**Risk vs. Reward:**

The potential reward of a high-quality product ($12,500) outweighs the potential loss of buying a low-quality product ($0). The current data suggests a higher probability of a good outcome."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 3 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 3 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 4th buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice has a perfect track record so far, recommending only high-quality products. This is a strong signal that the current product is likely high quality. 
* **Probability:** Even without Alice's recommendation, the initial probability of a high-quality product is 80%, which is significantly higher than the chance of it being low quality. 
* **Potential payoff:** A high-quality product yields a profit of $2,500 ($12,500 value - $10,000 price). This outweighs the potential loss of $10,000 if the product is low quality. 

While there's always a risk, the information available strongly suggests that this product is likely a good investment."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which is a strong signal as she knows the true quality.
* **Sales Record:** 100% of the products sold so far have been high quality. This is a very high percentage and reinforces the positive signal from Alice's recommendation.

Given this information, it's highly likely that the product is high quality, and the potential reward ($12,500) outweighs the potential loss ($0). Therefore, it's rational to buy the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 5 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 5 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 6th buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice has a perfect track record so far, recommending only high-quality products. This strong signal suggests the current product is likely high-quality.
* **Statistics:**  The fact that 5 out of 5 products sold were high-quality reinforces Alice's reliability. This indicates a strong probability of the current product being high-quality as well.

While there's still a 20% chance of the product being low-quality, the evidence strongly suggests it's worth the risk.  The potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of a low-quality one."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 6 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 6 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 7th buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:**  The seller has a 100% success rate in selling high-quality products. This suggests the seller is either incredibly lucky or has perfect information about the quality of the products. 
* **Recommendation:** The seller's recommendation is a strong signal. Since they know the true value of the products, a recommendation is likely to be based on the product being high quality.

Even though there's a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the data strongly suggests the product is likely high quality. The potential reward of $2,500 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 7 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 7 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 8th buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since all 7 previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendations received high-quality products, it's highly likely that Alice is recommending the current product because it's also high quality. 

While there's still a 20% chance it could be low quality, the strong track record makes buying the product the more logical decision."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 8 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 8 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 9th buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  8 out of 8 products sold were high quality. This suggests Alice's recommendations are very reliable. 
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice has an incentive to recommend high-quality products to maximize her sales.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even with a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($12,500) significantly outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0). 

Based on the information available, the decision to buy is the most logical choice."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 9 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 9 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 10th buyer!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, who knows the true quality of the product, is not recommending you buy it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.
* **Past sales:** 100% of the products sold so far have been high quality. This is a very unusual pattern and likely a result of Alice strategically offering only high-quality products to those she recommended to buy.

While the expected value of buying (80% chance of $12,500) is higher than the price, Alice's negative recommendation outweighs this factor. It's safer to pass and avoid the risk of getting a low-quality product."

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has a perfect track record, selling only high-quality products so far. Given her knowledge of the products' true quality, her recommendation to buy is a strong signal that the product is high-quality. Even though there's a 20% chance it might be low-quality, the potential gain ($12,500) outweighs the risk of losing $10,000."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 10 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 10 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 11th buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products. This strongly suggests that Alice is accurately identifying and recommending high-quality products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation to buy further strengthens the likelihood of a high-quality product.
* **Potential Gain:** Even with the inherent risk of a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain of $2,500 (value to you minus the price) outweighs the potential loss of $10,000. 

**Conclusion:**  Based on the available information, the decision to buy is a rational choice with a high probability of a positive outcome."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 11 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 11 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 12th buyer!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice, who knows the true quality of the product, is recommending against buying it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. 
* **Sales History:** The fact that all 11 previous products sold were high quality is highly unusual given the 80/20 probability. This suggests either:
    * Alice has been intentionally selling only high-quality products to build trust.
    * The 80/20 probability is incorrect, and products are almost always high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even if the 80/20 probability is correct, the risk of buying a low-quality product and losing $10,000 outweighs the potential reward of getting a high-quality product for a good price.

Given Alice's recommendation and the unusual sales history, it's much safer to pass on this product."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Given the information, the seller has a 100% success rate in selling high-quality products. While this could be due to pure luck, it's also possible the seller is deliberately recommending only high-quality products to buyers. Since the value of a high-quality product is significantly higher than the price, it makes sense to accept the offer."

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who knows the quality of each product, is not recommending the product. This is a strong indicator that the product is likely low quality.
* **Sales Record:** All 12 previous buyers who purchased the product received high-quality products.  This suggests that Alice is not recommending products unless they are high quality. 

While there's a chance the current product is high quality, the combination of Alice's recommendation and the strong sales record heavily favors the product being low quality. It's not worth the risk of losing $10,000."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```
