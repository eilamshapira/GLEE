Let's explain briefly without giving away too many internal details. Each product’s payoff is +20 if it’s high quality (worth 120 minus the purchase price 100) and –100 if it’s low quality. Even though Alice recommends buying the product, the public record shows that among the four previous buyers, only three received a high‐quality product. (That is 75% high quality among past purchases.) Given the stakes, a risk‐neutral buyer’s decision is based on the expected profit:

  Expected profit = (Probability high quality × 20) + (Probability low quality × (–100))

Using the 75% figure from history, the calculation is:
  0.75 × 20 + 0.25 × (–100) = 15 – 25 = –10

A negative expected profit implies that, based on the available data and the seller’s past outcomes, it is better not to buy the current product—even if Alice’s recommendation is “buy.” 

Thus, the advisable decision is “no.”"
