"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me think through this logically:

1. If Alice is being truthful, her ""do not buy"" recommendation suggests the product is low quality
2. Given the base probabilities:
   - 33.33% chance of high quality ($1,250,000 value)
   - 66.67% chance of low quality ($0 value)
3. Expected value without additional information = (0.3333 × $1,250,000) + (0.6667 × $0) = $416,625
4. The price is $1,000,000
5. Alice knows the true value and is recommending against buying
6. This reinforces the likelihood that it's low quality

Given that Alice is recommending against buying and the base expected value is already below the price, I should not buy.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Let me analyze this:

1. In the previous round, Alice was truthful about recommending against a low-quality product
2. Now Alice is actively recommending to buy
3. This could suggest Alice is being honest with her recommendations
4. If Alice is being honest, this likely means the product is high quality
5. A high-quality product is worth $1,250,000 to me
6. The price is $1,000,000
7. If it is indeed high quality, I would make a $250,000 profit
8. Alice demonstrated truthfulness in Round 1

Given that Alice proved truthful in Round 1 and is now recommending to buy, plus the potential profit if it's high quality, I should buy.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

   - Round 2: Recommended buying a high-quality product
2. Now Alice is recommending against buying
3. Alice has established a pattern of honest recommendations
4. Given her proven track record of honesty, this likely means the product is low quality
5. If it's low quality, it would be worth $0 to me
6. The price remains $1,000,000
7. Risking $1,000,000 when Alice has been truthful and is warning against buying seems unwise

Given Alice's established credibility and her negative recommendation, I should not buy.

3. Given her consistent honesty pattern, this strongly suggests another low-quality product
