{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

I will continue to buy the products as long as the expected value is in my favor. The expected value for each product is:

\( E = (0.8 \times \$40,000) + (0.2 \times \$0) - \$10,000 \)
\( E = \$32,000 - \$10,000 \)
\( E = \$22,000 \)

Since the expected value is positive, it makes sense to continue buying the products."

Since the expected value remains positive ($22,000), I will continue to buy the products.

- I will always buy the product because the expected value calculation shows that, on average, I will make a profit of $22,000 per product.
- This strategy is based on the long-term average outcome, even though individual results may vary."
