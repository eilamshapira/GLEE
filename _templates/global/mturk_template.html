<!--      This HIT is an academic experiment on behavior in strategic games, specifically, language-based games.-->
        You are invited to participate in an experiment. The experiment is part of research
        conducted in the Data and Decision Science Faculty of the Technion, Haifa.
        The use of large language models (i.e., ChatGPT) or any other AI tool during the experiment is prohibited.
        Pay attention: at the end of the experiment, you will be asked to answer one simple
        question to verify you indeed read the texts in the experiment.
        If you do not answer it correctly, we will reject your work, and you will not get paid.
        After completing this HIT, you will receive your participant fee plus a bonus payment based on your performance.
        If you have already participated in another HIT with the exact same name,
        you must wait 12 hours before participating again, otherwise you will not be paid for the second participation.
